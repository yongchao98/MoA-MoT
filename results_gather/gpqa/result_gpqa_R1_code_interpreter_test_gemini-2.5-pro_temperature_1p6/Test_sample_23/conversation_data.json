    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`. This is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    *   If the mass fraction is 1/7, then `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`, which gives `7m = 12n + m`, so `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, Z has the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane. A non-cyclic alkane would be CnH2n+2.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture X (two unsaturated liquids, A and B) and Mixture Y (two other liquids, C and D) both give *only* substance Z upon hydrogenation under severe conditions.\n    *   This is a very strong clue. It implies that all four compounds (A, B, C, D) share the same carbon skeleton, which is the skeleton of the cycloalkane Z. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, all other compounds must be based on a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by treating mixture X with Pt at high temperature. The reaction is a \"disproportionation\".\n    *   Mixture Y is equimolar and contains two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z is one of the components of Y. Let's say C = Z = a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Since D is also in Y, it must not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of D also yields Z. This means D must be an isomer of Z (also CnH2n) or something that hydrogenates to Z.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation. This is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. An isomerization (like turning methylcyclopentane into cyclohexane) is not a redox reaction. A disproportionation reaction will produce substances with different hydrogen content (different oxidation states).\n    *   This suggests that Y cannot be a mixture of two isomeric cycloalkanes (like cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane).\n    *   The classic example of such a disproportionation on a Pt catalyst is the Zelinsky reaction, where a cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene disproportionates into a cycloalkane (reduced product) and an aromatic compound (oxidized product).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y must consist of the cycloalkane Z and its corresponding aromatic derivative.\n    *   So, Y = {CnH2n (Z), CnH(2n-6) (aromatic)}. Let's check this:\n        *   The cycloalkane doesn't react with Br2 water.\n        *   The aromatic compound (like benzene or toluene) does not react with Br2 water. So Y doesn't decolorize it.\n        *   Hydrogenation of the cycloalkane gives itself. Hydrogenation of the aromatic compound under severe conditions gives the cycloalkane. So, hydrogenating Y gives only Z.\n        *   This model fits all the facts about Y.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stoichiometry and Identity of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is equimolar in two liquids, A and B.\n    *   Mixture Y is equimolar in two liquids, C (Z) and D (aromatic).\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C + D` because a 1:1 reaction of an equimolar mixture produces an equimolar product mixture.\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case for the carbon skeleton, a six-membered ring (n=6).\n        *   Z would be cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the \"widely used as a solvent\" description and H% of 14.28%.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is benzene, C6H6.\n        *   So, Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, if A = C6Ha and B = C6Hb, then `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   The liquids in mixture X, A and B, must be unsaturated C6 compounds (they decolorize Br2 water), have a six-membered ring skeleton (so they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), and have no conjugated multiple bonds. Their hydrogen counts must sum to 18.\n    *   Possible C6 unsaturated ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It is non-conjugated.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It is conjugated, so it is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It is non-conjugated.\n    *   Let's see if we can combine these to get a total of 18 hydrogens:\n        *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n        *   Total hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n5.  **Final Verification and Calculation**\n    *   Let's check if this solution is consistent.\n    *   X = {C6H10, C6H8}. Equimolar, liquids, decolorize Br2, non-conjugated. Check.\n    *   Reaction on Pt: `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6`. This is a plausible hydrogen transfer. C6H8 gets dehydrogenated to C6H6, and C6H10 gets hydrogenated to C6H12.\n    *   Y = {C6H12, C6H6}. Equimolar, doesn't decolorize Br2 water. Check.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X and Y gives only C6H12 (Z). Check.\n    *   Z = C6H12 (cyclohexane). All properties match. Check.\n    *   The whole scheme is consistent.\n    *   A similar scheme could be built for C7 compounds (methylcyclohexane/toluene), which would result in A=C7H12 and B=C7H10, giving a total H count of 22 (also an option). However, the C6 system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of chemistry. In the absence of further information, the simplest parent system is the intended answer.\n\n6.  **Answer the Question**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nI will use python just to confirm the mass fraction calculation.\n```python\n# Atomic masses (approximate integer values used in such problems)\nC_mass_int = 12\nH_mass_int = 1\n\n# Formula of Z is CnH2n\n# Mass fraction of H = (2n * H_mass_int) / (n * C_mass_int + 2n * H_mass_int)\n# The 'n' cancels out\nmass_frac_h = (2 * H_mass_int) / (C_mass_int + 2 * H_mass_int)\nprint(f\"Mass fraction of H in CnH2n: {mass_frac_h}\")\nprint(f\"1/7 as a decimal: {1/7}\")\nprint(f\"The given value 14.28% is {14.28/100}.\")\n\n# Calculate total H atoms for the identified liquids in mixture X\nH_atoms_liquid1 = 10  # Cyclohexene, C6H10\nH_atoms_liquid2 = 8   # 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8\ntotal_H_atoms = H_atoms_liquid1 + H_atoms_liquid2\nprint(f\"Total H atoms in the two liquids of mixture X: {total_H_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CnHm is given by `m(1.008) / (n(12.011) + m(1.008))`. For typical competitive chemistry problems, we can use integer masses: `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28% (or 0.1428): `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value is very close to 1/7, which is approximately 0.142857.\n    *   If `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`, then `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, hydrocarbon Z has the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated (cannot be hydrogenated further) must be a cycloalkane. An acyclic alkane would have the formula CnH2n+2.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Relationships between the Mixtures**:\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids (let's call them A and B). It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids (let's call them C and D). It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (A+B) and mixture Y (C+D) gives *only* substance Z. This is a critical piece of information. It means that all four compounds A, B, C, and D must share the same carbon skeleton, which is that of the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   Z is one of the components of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is the cycloalkane CnH2n. Let C = Z.\n    *   The other component of Y, D, must also hydrogenate to Z and must not decolorize bromine water.\n\n3.  **Identify the Disproportionation Reaction**:\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X upon heating with a platinum catalyst in a \"disproportionation\" reaction.\n    *   In organic chemistry, a disproportionation reaction on a metal catalyst often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) while another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   Given that one product is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n), the other product must be a hydrogen-poor compound that can be formed from the same carbon skeleton. The most stable hydrogen-poor product formed from a cycloalkane skeleton is an aromatic compound (e.g., CnH2n-6 for a single aromatic ring).\n    *   An aromatic compound like benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Also, under severe hydrogenation conditions (high pressure/temperature), it can be reduced to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z = CnH2n) and an aromatic compound (D = CnH2n-6). This fits all the given conditions for mixture Y.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Compounds**:\n    *   Let's consider the simplest and most common system that fits this model, the C6 system.\n    *   Z would be cyclohexane, C6H12. This is a widely used solvent. Mass % H = `12 / (6*12 + 12)` = `12 / 84` = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. This matches.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound would be benzene, C6H6.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids, A and B, which react to form an equimolar mixture of Y. The overall reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides. Since A and B have the same C6 skeleton, A = C6Ha and B = C6Hb.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved: `Ha + Hb = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   We need to find two unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds (A and B) that are liquids, whose molecules have non-conjugated double bonds, and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Let's consider possible C6 cyclic alkenes:\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10. It has one double bond and is non-conjugated.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: C6H8. It has two conjugated double bonds, so this is explicitly excluded by the problem statement.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: C6H8. It has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n    *   Let's test the combination of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene for mixture X.\n        *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our derived requirement.\n    *   This combination fits all conditions: two liquids, unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water), non-conjugated, and they can plausibly undergo hydrogen transfer on Pt to yield cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis reasoning is self-consistent and leads to one of the provided options.\n\nLet's use a quick Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Atomic masses\nC_mass = 12\nH_mass = 1\n\n# Check mass fraction for Z (CnH2n, here C6H12)\nmass_H_Z = 12 * H_mass\nmass_C_Z = 6 * C_mass\ntotal_mass_Z = mass_C_Z + mass_H_Z\nmass_fraction_H = mass_H_Z / total_mass_Z\nprint(f\"Mass fraction of H in C6H12: {mass_fraction_H:.4f}\")\n\n# The two liquids in mixture X are C6H10 and C6H8.\n# Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.\nH_atoms_liquid_1 = 10\nH_atoms_liquid_2 = 8\ntotal_H_atoms = H_atoms_liquid_1 + H_atoms_liquid_2\nprint(f\"Total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X: {total_H_atoms}\")\n```\nThe python code execution output confirms the math.\n\nThe mass fraction of H in C6H12 is 12 / (72 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1429, matching the problem statement.\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the final answer.\n\n1.  **Determine the formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. This is equivalent to the decimal 0.1428.\n    *   This value is characteristic of the general formula CnH2n. We can verify this:\n        *   Mass fraction of H = `(Mass of H) / (Total Mass)` = `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n)` = `2n / 14n` = 1/7.\n        *   `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given value.\n    *   So, Z has the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. A saturated hydrocarbon (one that cannot be hydrogenated) with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reactions and the nature of the mixtures.**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a platinum catalyst. Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z is a component of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is the cycloalkane CnH2n.\n    *   The classic reaction of this type is the Zelinsky disproportionation, where a cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene, upon heating with Pt, undergoes hydrogen transfer to form a mixture of the corresponding cycloalkane (reduced product) and aromatic compound (oxidized product).\n    *   This fits the description perfectly. The cycloalkane (Z) would not react with bromine water. The aromatic compound also would not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of the cycloalkane yields itself, and hydrogenation of the aromatic ring under severe conditions yields the cycloalkane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) and an aromatic compound (let's call it D, CnH(2n-6)).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z, all compounds involved must share the same carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific compounds.**\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case that fits this description: a six-membered ring system (n=6).\n    *   Z would be cyclohexane, C6H12, which is a common solvent. Its formula matches CnH2n.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound would be benzene, C6H6.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n4.  **Determine the composition of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that reacts to give the equimolar mixture Y. The overall reaction is `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, A and B must both be C6 compounds, and the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Let A = C6Ha and B = C6Hb. Then the total number of hydrogen atoms from X is `a + b`.\n    *   Total H atoms in Y = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The compounds in mixture X decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and do not have conjugated multiple bonds. We need to find two non-conjugated unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n        *   Cyclohexene is C6H10. It has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene is C6H8. It has two isolated double bonds (non-conjugated). (Note: 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check if this pair works:\n        *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n        *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   Thus, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n5.  **Answer the question.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
