    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Dimensional Analysis in Natural Units**\n\nIn high-energy physics, we often use natural units where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1 ($\\hbar=c=1$). In this system, mass, energy, and momentum all have the same dimension, which we denote as mass dimension $[M]$. Length and time have the inverse mass dimension, $[L] = [T] = [M^{-1}]$.\n\nThe action, $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$, is a dimensionless quantity, i.e., it has a mass dimension of 0.\nThe four-dimensional spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x] = [L^4] = [M^{-4}]$.\nSince the action $S$ is dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4 to compensate for the $[M^{-4}]$ from $d^4x$.\nTherefore, $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\n**2. Mass Dimension of the Fields**\n\nTo find the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$, we first need to determine the mass dimensions of the fields involved in the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$. We can find these from their respective kinetic terms in a standard QFT Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field ($\\psi$)**: The kinetic term for a fermion is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. Every term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4. Let's look at the mass term, $m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$.\n    *   The mass $m$ has a dimension of $[m]_M = 1$.\n    *   So, $[m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi]_M = [m]_M[\\bar{\\psi}]_M[\\psi]_M = 4$.\n    *   Assuming $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$, we have $1 \\cdot [\\psi]_M^2 = 4$? This is not correct. Let's use the kinetic term instead, as it is more fundamental.\n    *   Consider the kinetic term $i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$. The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless. The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   The dimension of the entire term must be 4: $[\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi]_M = 4$.\n    *   This implies $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M + [\\psi]_M = 4$.\n    *   With $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M$, we have $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$, which gives $2[\\psi]_M = 3$, so $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n    *   Thus, the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be 4: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   This means $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M^2 = 4$, which leads to $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$.\n    *   The Dirac gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices.\n    *   Therefore, their commutator, and thus $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$, is also dimensionless.\n    *   $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ from the given interaction Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. As part of the total Lagrangian, this term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n\nPlugging in the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants, a principle known as power-counting.\n\nLet $\\delta$ be the mass dimension of a coupling constant.\n*   If $\\delta > 0$, the coupling is \"super-renormalizable\".\n*   If $\\delta = 0$, the coupling is \"renormalizable\" (or \"marginal\").\n*   If $\\delta < 0$, the coupling is \"non-renormalizable\" (or \"irrelevant\").\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $[\\kappa]_M = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nA negative mass dimension implies that at high energies (which are probed in loop calculations), the effective coupling becomes very large, leading to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms. The interaction term corresponds to a \"dimension-5 operator\" ($\\mathcal{O} = \\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$, with dimension $3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5$), which signals non-renormalizability.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n*   The theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
