    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP. This is the foreign substance that will trigger an immune response.\n    *   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract's immune system.\n    *   **Initial Hurdles:** Stomach acid and intestinal mucus are mentioned. This is a realistic detail, confirming that the experiment is simulating a natural route of infection and that not all the antigen will reach its target. It doesn't change the core immunology question.\n    *   **Location of Response:** \"Fluorescent Peyer's patches\". Peyer's patches are a type of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT), which are key secondary lymphoid organs for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens. The fluorescence confirms the antigen has successfully reached these sites.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** \"Isolate the proliferating cell population\". Cell proliferation (or clonal expansion) is a fundamental characteristic of an adaptive immune response. When lymphocytes (like B cells or T cells) recognize their specific antigen, they are activated and multiply rapidly.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** \"Sequence their variable heavy chain gene\". This is a critical clue. \"Heavy chain\" specifically refers to the protein chains that make up B cell receptors (BCRs) and antibodies. The \"variable\" region is the part that binds to the antigen. Therefore, the experiment is focused on the genetics of B cells.\n    *   **Key Finding:** \"Observe high variability\" in this specific gene region. This means that among the population of proliferating B cells, the DNA sequence of the variable heavy chain gene is not identical but has many small differences (mutations).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):**\n        *   **What is it?** A cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches).\n        *   **What does it do?** It deliberately introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains).\n        *   **Why does it happen?** The purpose is to create slightly different versions of the B cell receptor. B cells whose mutated receptors bind the antigen with higher affinity are selected to survive and proliferate, a process called affinity maturation.\n        *   **Does it fit the evidence?** Yes, perfectly. It happens in proliferating B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) in response to an antigen, and its defining characteristic is creating \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\".\n\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):**\n        *   **What is it?** A process that also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers.\n        *   **What does it do?** It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene. This switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is very common in the gut).\n        *   **Does it fit the evidence?** While CSR is likely happening in these cells, it affects the *constant* region, not the *variable* region. The question specifically states the high variability was found in the *variable* heavy chain gene. Therefore, CSR is not the primary process described by the key finding.\n\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:**\n        *   **What is it?** The genetic process that initially assembles the variable region genes from V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments.\n        *   **When and where does it happen?** It occurs during the development of B cells in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ), *before* they ever encounter an antigen.\n        *   **Does it fit the evidence?** No. While it creates initial diversity, the process described in the question is happening in *mature*, *proliferating* B cells within a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to a specific antigen. The timing and location are wrong. V(D)J recombination has already been completed long before this step.\n\n    *   **D) Complement activation:**\n        *   **What is it?** A component of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of proteins in the blood and tissue fluids that helps to eliminate pathogens.\n        *   **What does it do?** It can tag pathogens for destruction (opsonization) or form a pore to lyse them directly.\n        *   **Does it fit the evidence?** No. Complement is a system of proteins, not a process of genetic change within proliferating lymphocytes. The finding of \"high variability\" in a gene cannot be explained by complement activation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only process that explains the observation of high genetic variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells within a Peyer's patch is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
