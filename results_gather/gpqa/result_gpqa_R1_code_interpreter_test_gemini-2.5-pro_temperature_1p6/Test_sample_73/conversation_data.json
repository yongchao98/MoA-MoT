    "This is a classic problem involving exponential decay, which is a memoryless process.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. A key property of the exponential distribution is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an event (decay) occurring in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived. In other words, the atom does not \"age.\" The fact that it has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n\n2.  **Define the Probability Model:**\n    Let `T` be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom has not decayed by time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t)`. For exponential decay, this is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability of decay within a time `t` is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF), `F(t) = P(T <= t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(T <= 100) = 0.32`\n    Using the formula for the CDF:\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\n    We can solve for `λ` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, but it's often easier to work directly with the `e^(-λt)` term.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    This can be written as a conditional probability: `P(T <= 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n    So we need to find `P(T <= 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Memorylessness Property:**\n    Because the process is memoryless, the condition that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    `P(T <= 200 | T > 50) = P(T <= 150)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to calculate `P(T <= 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    From Step 3, we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`. We can use this to find `e^(-150λ)`.\n    `e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    `e^(-150λ) = 0.68^1.5`\n\n    Now, we can substitute this back into our probability calculation:\n    `P(T <= 150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To get the numerical answer, we calculate `1 - 0.68^1.5`. We can use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given P(T <= 100) = 0.32. This means 1 - exp(-100*lambda) = 0.32,\n# so exp(-100*lambda) = 0.68.\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given survival for 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is the same as the probability of a new atom\n# decaying within 150 minutes: P(T <= 150) = 1 - exp(-150*lambda).\n\n# We can find exp(-150*lambda) from exp(-100*lambda) = 0.68.\n# exp(-150*lambda) = exp(-1.5 * 100 * lambda) = (exp(-100*lambda))^1.5 = 0.68**1.5\n\n# Calculate the probability.\nprobability = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n\n# Convert to percentage and print\nprint(f\"{probability * 100:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculation yields a probability of approximately 0.44. Converted to a percentage, this is 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process and final answer:\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Model the Phenomenon**: Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom survives past a certain time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant unique to the type of atom. The probability that it decays *by* time `t` is `F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use Given Data to Find the Decay Constant**: We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find information about `λ`.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    *   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    We don't need to solve for `λ` itself; having the value of `e^(-100λ)` is sufficient.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically**: We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability.\n    *   Let `A` be the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. This means its lifetime `T` is between 50 and 50+150=200 minutes. So, `A` is the event `50 < T ≤ 200`.\n    *   Let `B` be the event that the atom has survived for 50 minutes. So, `B` is the event `T > 50`.\n    *   We need to find `P(A | B) = P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property**: A key feature of exponential decay is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of a future event doesn't depend on how long the atom has already survived. The atom does not \"age\". Mathematically, `P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)`.\n    *   In our case, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    *   So, `P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can find `e^(-150λ)` using the value we found in step 2: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   Using the laws of exponents: `e^(-150λ) = e^(-1.5 * 100λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Substitute the known value: `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value**: Now we can compute the probability.\n    *   `Probability = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   To get a precise value, a calculation is needed.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given P(T <= 100) = 0.32, which means 1 - exp(-100*lambda) = 0.32.\n# From this, we derive exp(-100*lambda) = 0.68.\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is equivalent to finding the probability\n# that a new atom decays within 150 minutes: P(T <= 150).\n\n# P(T <= 150) = 1 - exp(-150*lambda).\n# We can write exp(-150*lambda) as (exp(-100*lambda))^(150/100) or (exp(-100*lambda))^1.5.\n\n# So, the probability is 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\nprobability = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n\n# Convert the probability to a percentage for the final answer.\nprint(f\"The probability is {probability * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe output of the code execution is `43.93%`. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes a radioactive decay process, which is governed by the exponential distribution. A key feature of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability that the atom will decay in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\"; its probability of decay per unit time remains constant.\n\n**1. Determine the Survival Probability from the Given Information**\n\n*   We are given that the probability of decay within the first 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32`\n*   This means the probability of the atom *not* decaying (surviving) in the first 100 minutes is:\n    `P(survive > 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nIn the language of exponential decay, the probability of survival up to time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. So, we have `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n**2. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\n*   The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes.\n*   Because the decay process is memoryless, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability.\n*   Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a *new* atom of the same type would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes**\n\n*   We need to calculate `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survive > 150 min)`.\n*   The probability of surviving 150 minutes is `P(survive > 150 min) = e^(-λ * 150)`.\n*   We can find this value using the information from step 1: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n*   Using the properties of exponents:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Substitute the known value:\n    `P(survive > 150 min) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    `P(survive > 150 min) ≈ 0.5607`\n*   The probability of decay is therefore:\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survive > 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n*   Converting this probability to a percentage gives `43.93%`.\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
