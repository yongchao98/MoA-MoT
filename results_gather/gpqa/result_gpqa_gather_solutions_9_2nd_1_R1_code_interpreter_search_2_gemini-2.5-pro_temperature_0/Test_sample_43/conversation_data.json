A suitable experiment must measure a parameter that is a direct function of mitochondria or a very strong and direct consequence of mitochondrial activity.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Experiment**\n\n*   **A) Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells:**\n    *   **Technique:** Confocal microscopy allows for high-resolution imaging of specific parts of a cell.\n    *   **Probe:** Mito-RTP is a fluorescent probe that specifically accumulates in mitochondria (\"Mito-\") and measures their temperature (\"-RTP\" for Real-time Temperature Probe).\n    *   **Relevance:** The redox reactions in mitochondria (oxidative phosphorylation) are exothermic, meaning they generate heat. A drug that alters mitochondrial metabolic activity would likely change this heat production. Therefore, measuring mitochondrial temperature is a direct way to assess the drug's effect on mitochondrial activity.\n    *   **Verdict:** This experiment **is helpful**.\n\n*   **B) Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 μM of luciferin addition to the supernatant:**\n    *   **Technique:** This is a luciferase-based bioluminescence assay. The enzyme luciferase uses ATP to produce light from the substrate luciferin.\n    *   **What it Measures:** The amount of light produced is directly proportional to the concentration of ATP. This assay measures the total cellular ATP level.\n    *   **Relevance:** The prompt states that mitochondria are \"cellular energy factories\" that store energy in phosphate groups (i.e., ATP). Mitochondria produce over 90% of the cell's ATP.
