In vector notation, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The surface enclosing this volume is denoted by `S`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Correct Method:**\n    *   A direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` in spherical coordinates gives `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = 0`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Singularity.** This calculation is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r=0`), the field `f` is undefined (singular). A naive integration of `∇ ⋅ f = 0` over the volume would incorrectly yield an answer of 0. The singularity at the origin acts as a source, and its contribution must be included.\n    *   The **Divergence Theorem** (or Gauss's Theorem) is the appropriate tool for this situation. It relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the enclosing surface, effectively capturing the contribution of any singularities within the volume. The theorem states:\n        `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Calculate the Surface Integral):**\n    *   We need to evaluate the flux integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **On the surface `S`**, the radius is constant: `r = R`. The vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **The differential surface element `dS`** for a sphere points radially outward. In spherical coordinates, its vector form is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`**:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Cancellation.** The `R^2` terms cancel each other out. Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n        This shows the flux is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    *   We now integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π (sin(θ) * dθ * dφ)`\n    *   The integral can be separated:\n        `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n    *   Evaluating each part:\n        *   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n        *   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n    *   Multiplying the results gives the total flux:\n        `Flux = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the calculated flux.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe most appropriate answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field and Volume**:\n    *   The vector field `f` has a magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2` and is directed radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this is written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Choose the Correct Method**:\n    The problem involves a vector field with a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where the field's magnitude becomes infinite. A direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` in spherical coordinates gives 0 for all `r ≠ 0`. If one were to naively integrate this zero value over the volume, the result would be 0, which is incorrect because it ignores the effect of the singularity.\n\n    The correct and most elegant method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. This method is ideal because it evaluates the field on the surface, where `r=R` and the field is well-behaved, while still accounting for the source (the singularity) within the volume.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral (Flux)**:\n    We need to calculate the flux `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **Field on the Surface**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius is constant, `r = R`. The vector field here is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Surface Element**: The differential surface element `dS` for a sphere is a vector that points in the outward normal direction. For a sphere centered at the origin, this is the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Dot Product**: We compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n        Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, and the `R^2` terms cancel each other out, the expression simplifies to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    *   **Integration**: We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are `0` to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are `0` to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) dφ ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ`\n        Evaluating the integrals separately:\n        *   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n        *   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n        The total flux is the product of these results: `(2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Singularity at the Origin**: The primary challenge in this problem is the singularity of the field at `r=0`. A direct calculation of the divergence gives 0 everywhere except at the origin, where it is undefined. The Divergence Theorem correctly captures the contribution of this singularity.\n*   **Dirac Delta Function**: More formally, the divergence of this specific field is described by the Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. The integral of `4πδ³(r)` over any volume containing the origin is `4π`, which confirms the result obtained from the Divergence Theorem.\n*   **Independence from Radius R**: The result `4π` is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere. This is a key feature of inverse-square fields and is fundamental to concepts like Gauss's Law in electromagnetism.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the application of the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`.

The goal is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and Volume:** The vector field `f` is radial with a magnitude of `1/r^2`, so `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`. The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n2.  **Choose the Correct Method:** A direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` gives 0 for all points except the origin (`r=0`), where the field is singular. Integrating 0 over the volume would incorrectly give a result of 0. The correct method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the enclosing surface.\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:** The theorem states: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`, where `S` is the surface of the sphere. This allows us to solve the problem by calculating the simpler surface integral (flux), which avoids the singularity at the origin.\n4.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is a constant `R`. So, the field is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere points radially outward: `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n    *   The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is `[(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`. The `R^2` terms cancel, and `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, leaving `sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`.\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:** We need to integrate `sin(θ) * dθ * dφ` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    *   The integral `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = 2`.\n    *   The integral `∫_0^(2π) dφ = 2π`.\n    *   The total flux is the product of these two results: `2 * 2π = 4π`.\n6.  **Conclusion:** By the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the calculated flux, which is `4π`.

So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Step 3b: Define the differential surface element.**\n    For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` is a vector that points in the outward normal direction. The outward normal is the radial direction, `r_hat`. The magnitude of the area element in spherical coordinates is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. Therefore, the vector element is:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`.**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, and the `R^2` terms cancel out, the expression simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   **Step 3d: Evaluate the surface integral.**\n    We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π (sin(θ) * dθ * dφ)`\n    This integral can be separated:\n    `= ( ∫_0^(2π) dφ ) * ( ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ )`\n    Evaluating each part:\n    *   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n    *   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    Multiplying the results gives the total flux:\n    `Flux = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**4.

Identify Key Challenges and Choose the Right Method**\nA direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` reveals a potential issue. Using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\nWith `f_r = 1/r^2`, this becomes:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\nThis result is only valid for `r ≠ 0`.

Problem Identification and Vector Field Definition**\nThe task is to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\nThe vector field `f` is defined by:\n*   **Magnitude**: `|f| = 1/r^2`\n*   **Direction**: Purely radial.\nIn vector notation, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction in spherical coordinates.\nThe volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choosing the Correct Method: The Divergence Theorem**\nThis problem is a classic application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\nwhere `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**3. Careful Point: The Singularity at the Origin**\nA critical aspect of this problem is the behavior of the vector field at the origin (`r=0`).\n*   The field's magnitude `1/r^2` becomes infinite at `r=0`. This is a singularity.\n*   If one were to calculate the divergence directly in spherical coordinates for `r ≠ 0`, the result would be `∇ ⋅ f = 0`.\n*   A common mistake is to assume that since the divergence is zero almost everywhere, the integral must be zero. This is incorrect because it ignores the contribution of the singularity at the origin, which acts as a source.\n*   The Divergence Theorem is the correct tool because it elegantly handles this situation by shifting the calculation from the volume (which contains the singularity) to the surface (where the field is well-behaved).\n\n**4. Evaluating the Surface Integral (Flux)**\nWe proceed by calculating the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Step 4a: Field on the Surface**\n    On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`.

Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, the vector is:\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Step 4c: The Dot Product**\n    We compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, and the `R^2` terms cancel out, the expression simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Careful Point: Independence of Radius**\n    Notice that the result of the dot product is independent of the radius `R`. This is a key feature of `1/r^2` fields and implies that the flux through any sphere enclosing the origin is the same.\n\n*   **Step 4d: The Integration**\n    We integrate the dot product over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0 to 2π ∫_θ=0 to π (sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n    This integral can be separated:\n    `= (∫_0 to 2π dφ) * (∫_0 to π sin(θ) dθ)`\n    Evaluating each part:\n    *   `∫_0 to 2π dφ = [φ]_0 to 2π = 2π`\n    *   `∫_0 to π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n    Multiplying the results gives the total flux:\n    `Flux = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5.

Identifying the Key Challenge: The Singularity**\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of `f` in spherical coordinates for `r ≠ 0` gives:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n\nIf the divergence were zero everywhere, the integral would be zero. However, the vector field `f` is undefined at the origin (`r=0`), a point known as a singularity. This singularity acts as a source, and its contribution to the integral is non-zero. Naively concluding the answer is 0 is a common pitfall.\n\n**3. Selecting the Correct Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (or Gauss's Theorem) is the ideal tool for this situation. It allows us to relate the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume. This method cleverly bypasses the need to directly handle the singularity at the origin. The theorem states:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**4. Executing the Calculation (Surface Integral)**\n\nWe need to evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the Surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. The vector field here is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **Surface Element Vector:** For a sphere, the differential surface element `dS` points radially outward. In spherical coordinates, its vector form is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n*   **Dot Product:** We compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n    The `R^2` terms cancel each other out. Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n*   **Integration:** We integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are `0` to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) dφ ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ`\n    *   The integral with respect to `θ` is `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The integral with respect to `φ` is `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`.\n*   **Final Result:** The total flux is the product of these two results: `(2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the calculated surface flux. Therefore, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\nThis result is a fundamental concept in fields like electromagnetism (Gauss's Law for a point charge).

However, the field `f` is undefined at the origin (`r = 0`), creating a singularity. If this singularity is ignored, one might incorrectly conclude the integral is 0. The Divergence Theorem elegantly accounts for the contribution of this singularity by evaluating the flux on the enclosing surface.\n    *   **The Dirac Delta Function**: More formally, the divergence of this specific field is described by the Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. The integral of this expression over any volume containing the origin is `4π`, which confirms the result obtained from the surface integral.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation via the Divergence Theorem**: We evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **Field on the Surface**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. The field here is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Surface Element**: The differential surface element `dS` for a sphere points radially outward and is given by `dS = (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Dot Product**: We compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n        The `R^2` terms cancel out, and since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sinθ dθ dφ`\n    *   **Integration**: We integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere, with the angle `φ` ranging from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) dφ ∫_0^π sinθ dθ`\n        The integral of `sinθ` from `0` to `π` is `2`.\n        The integral of `dφ` from `0` to `2π` is `2π`.\n        The final result is the product of these two values: `2 * 2π = 4π`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the reasoning in the candidate answers is that the Divergence Theorem is the correct method.

So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Step 3b: Define the differential surface element.**\n    For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` is a vector that points in the outward normal direction. The outward normal is the radial direction, `r_hat`. The magnitude of the area element in spherical coordinates is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. Therefore, the vector element is:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`.**\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, and the `R^2` terms cancel out, the expression simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n*   **Step 3d: Evaluate the surface integral.**\n    We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere.

Understand the Problem Statement**\nThe goal is to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: The field has a magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2` and is directed radially outward from the origin. In vector notation, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the radial unit vector.\n*   **Volume of Integration `V`**: The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThe integral to evaluate is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Identify Key Challenges and Choose the Right Method**\nA direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` reveals a potential issue. Using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\nWith `f_r = 1/r^2`, this becomes:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\nThis result is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f` is undefined (it has a singularity), and so is its divergence. Naively integrating `0` over the volume would give an incorrect answer of `0`.\n\nThe correct method to handle such problems with a singularity at the origin is the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\nwhere `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`. This approach is powerful because it allows us to perform the calculation on the surface of the sphere, where the field is well-defined, while still accounting for the effect of the singularity inside.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\nWe need to calculate the surface integral (flux) `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the Surface**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. The vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **Surface Element Vector `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` points in the outward normal direction, which is the radial direction `r_hat`. In spherical coordinates, its magnitude is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. So, the vector is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n*   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: We compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, and the `R^2` terms cancel out, the expression simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for the polar angle `θ` are from `0` to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`= ( ∫_0^(2π) dφ ) * ( ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ )`\n\nEvaluating each integral:\n*   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n*   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n\nMultiplying the results gives the total flux:\n`Flux = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\nThe python code execution confirms this result: `4*pi`.\n\n**5.

The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\nwhere `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**3. Address the Singularity at the Origin (A Careful Point)**\nA direct calculation of the divergence of `f` in spherical coordinates for `r ≠ 0` gives:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\nThis might lead one to incorrectly conclude that the integral is zero. However, the vector field `f` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r=0`). The divergence is non-zero at this single point, acting as a source. The Divergence Theorem is the correct tool because it allows us to calculate the effect of this source by evaluating an integral on the boundary surface `S`, where the field is well-defined.\n\n**4.

So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **Differential Surface Element:** For a sphere, the differential surface area vector `dS` points radially outward. In spherical coordinates, its expression is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n*   **Dot Product:** We compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, and the `R^2` terms cancel out, the expression simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n*   **Integration:** Now, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π (sin(θ) * dθ * dφ)`\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n    Evaluating each integral:\n    *   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n    *   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n    Multiplying the results gives the total flux:\n    `Flux = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5.
