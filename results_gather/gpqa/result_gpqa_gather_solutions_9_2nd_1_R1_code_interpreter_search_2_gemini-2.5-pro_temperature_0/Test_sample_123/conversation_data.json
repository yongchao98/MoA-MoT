The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n3.  **Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** Given `f₁ = 1/3` and `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** Given `f₂ = 2/3`, we need to find `γ₂`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** We can solve this system of equations by first finding an expression for the constant `K` and then solving for `γ₂`.\n    *   From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   From Scenario 2, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K` into the second equation:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n        Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we get `ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2)`.\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 54.

The lifetime measured in the lab is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   The fraction of surviving particles is given by `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`, where `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   The time of flight `t_lab` for a particle traveling a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v` is `t_lab = R/v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n    *   The lab-frame lifetime `τ_lab` is related to the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime `τ_proper` by time dilation: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n    *   Substituting these into the survival equation gives:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**:\n    The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The simplified equation is `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**:\n        *   Fraction `f₁` = 1/3\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₁` = 20\n        *   Equation: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2**:\n        *   Fraction `f₂` = 2/3\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₂` = ?

First, take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n    *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  => `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify `ln(2/3)` to `-ln(3/2)`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**:\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value is approximately 54.

The decay law is fundamentally based on the particle's proper time, but it's often more convenient to work in the lab frame by using the dilated lifetime (`τ_lab`). All candidate answers correctly applied this principle.\n*   **Ultra-Relativistic Approximation**: The problem simplifies the calculation of travel time by stating the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies the approximation `v ≈ c`.\n*   **Identifying Constants**: The key to solving the problem efficiently is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant across both scenarios, allowing for the creation of a ratio or system of equations that eliminates the need to calculate the proper lifetime `τ_proper` or the constant `K` explicitly.\n*   **Logical Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which in turn requires a larger Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physical expectation.\n*   **Option Mapping**: Several candidate answers calculated the correct numerical value (~54) but mapped it to the wrong letter (A or B), likely due to a different ordering of the options in their context. The final answer must be based on the option list provided in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physics:** The problem combines two key concepts from modern physics: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `t_p` is the time elapsed in the particle's own reference frame (proper time) and `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The time in the lab's frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. The time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab is `t_lab ≈ R/c` (since they are ultra-relativistic). Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ = R / (γ * c)`.\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** Substituting the expression for `t_p` into the survival equation gives:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n5.  **Establish a Proportionality:** The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. By taking the natural logarithm, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which can be rearranged to `γ * ln(1/f) = K`. Since `K` is constant, the product `γ * ln(1/f)` must be the same in both scenarios.\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown:** We can set up a ratio:\n    `γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n    We are given `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`, and `f₂ = 2/3`. We need to find `γ₂`.\n    `γ₂ = γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) / ln(1/f₂)`\n7.  **Calculate the Result:** I will use Python to compute the final numerical value and compare it against the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the required Lorentz factor based on the principles of special relativity.\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Scenario 1\ngamma_1 = 20\nfraction_1 = 1/3\n\n# Scenario 2\nfraction_2 = 2/3\n\n# --- Derivation ---\n# The fraction of surviving particles 'f' is related to the Lorentz factor 'gamma' by:\n# f = exp(-K / gamma), where K is a constant for the system.\n# Taking the natural log: ln(f) = -K / gamma\n# Rearranging: K = -gamma * ln(f) = gamma * ln(1/f)\n# Since K is constant for both scenarios:\n# gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) = gamma_2 * ln(1/f_2)\n# Solving for gamma_2:\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) / ln(1/f_2)\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# We can substitute the values into the derived formula.\n# ln(1/f_1) = ln(1 / (1/3)) = ln(3)\n# ln(1/f_2) = ln(1 / (2/3)) = ln(3/2) or ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(1 / fraction_1) / math.log(1 / fraction_2)\n\n# --- Output the result and compare with options ---\nprint(f\"The calculated Lorentz factor is: {gamma_2:.2f}\")\n\n# The provided options are:\noptions = {'A': 68, 'B': 40, 'C': 28, 'D': 54}\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result with the given options:\")\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) {value}\")\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_choice = min(options, key=lambda choice: abs(options[choice] - gamma_2))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value of {gamma_2:.2f} is closest to option {closest_choice}, which is {options[closest_choice]}.\")\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {closest_choice}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated Lorentz factor is: 54.19\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 40\nC) 28\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value of 54.19 is closest to option D, which is 54.\n\nFinal Answer: D\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principles:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. This requires combining two key concepts:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles decreases exponentially over time. The fundamental law is expressed in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a high velocity experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. This effect is quantified by the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` (time in the particle's own frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   The time the particle takes to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Time dilation connects the lab time and the proper time: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Equation and Set Up a Ratio:**\n    *   The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup, as `R`, `c`, and `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    *   The simplified equation is `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can write:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these values into our ratio equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel out:\n        `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)`), we can rewrite the expression:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

This is justified by the problem statement.\n*   **Constants:** Recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant allows for solving the problem without knowing the particle's proper lifetime or even using the specific value of the detector radius.\n*   **Logical Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay more slowly from the lab's perspective. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means the Lorentz factor `γ` must be higher. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed greater than the initial value (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms our physical intuition.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the formula `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nFirst, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`. The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n*   `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\nNext, we find the proper time `t_p` that passes for the particle during its flight.\n*   `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γc)`\n\nNow, we substitute this proper time into the exponential decay formula to get the fraction of surviving particles `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n*   `f = exp(-t_p / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\nThe term `R / (cτ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n*   `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **3. Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nWe can set up an equation for each scenario and solve for the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTo solve this system, we can take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify `ln(2/3)` to `-ln(3/2)`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nWe can now calculate the value of `γ₂`.\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 28\nC) 68\nD) 40\n\nThe value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles decreases exponentially over time.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. This means its observed lifetime in the lab frame is longer than its \"proper\" lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory's reference frame is given by:\n`f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame.\n*   `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\nWe need to express `t` and `τ_lab` in terms of the problem's variables:\n*   **Time of Flight (t):** The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n*   **Lab Lifetime (τ_lab):** Due to time dilation, the lab lifetime is related to the particle's proper lifetime, `τ₀`, by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n\nSubstituting these into the survival equation gives:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThis can be simplified by grouping the constants. Let `K = R / (c * τ₀)`. The value of `K` is constant for this specific particle and detector. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **3. Set Up Equations for the Two Scenarios**\n\nWe can now apply this formula to the two situations described in the problem.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Plugging these in: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these in: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nThe most direct way to solve for `γ₂` is to first find an expression for the constant `K` and then equate the two scenarios.\n\n1.  Take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n2.  Take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n    `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n3.

The fraction of particles that survive a journey depends on the time elapsed in their own reference frame (proper time), which is shorter than the time measured in the laboratory due to time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` is given by the decay law: `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle is related to the lab time by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n    *   Substituting these into the decay law gives the survival fraction as a function of `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio to Solve:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, we can equate its value from both scenarios:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, we get:\n        `20 * [-ln(3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(3/2)]`\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

This law must be considered in the context of relativity.\n    *   The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial population `N₀` after a proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own rest frame) is given by `N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime.\n    *   The time elapsed in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`, where `R` is the detector radius (30 m) and `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" we can approximate `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time in the lab frame is related to the proper time by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ = R / (γ * c)`.\n    *   Substituting this into the decay equation gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n2.  **Set up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup.

Many of the candidate answers incorrectly map their correct calculation to the wrong letter choice.\n\nThe required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Underlying Physics\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time follows the law `f = exp(-t_proper / τ_proper)`, where `t_proper` is the time elapsed in the particle's own reference frame (its proper time) and `τ_proper` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation (Special Relativity):** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time by `t_lab = γ * t_proper`. Therefore, the proper time elapsed during the particle's flight is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Governing Equation\n\n1.  **Time of Flight in Lab Frame (`t_lab`):** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" we can approximate their speed `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). Thus, the time of flight in the lab is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n2.  **Proper Time of Flight (`t_proper`):** Substituting `t_lab` into the time dilation formula, we find the time experienced by the particle: `t_proper = (R / c) / γ = R / (γc)`.\n3.  **Survival Fraction Formula:** Now, we substitute this expression for `t_proper` into the exponential decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t_proper / τ_proper) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### 3. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)\n\nWe have two scenarios, which allows us to solve for `γ₂`.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂ = ?`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nWe can solve this system by creating a ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `K`. First, take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  => `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Numerical Value\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly derive the formula and arrive at the same numerical result of approximately 54.2.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated value of ~54.19 is closest to the numerical option 54.

Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles decreases exponentially over time.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving clock runs slower than a stationary one. For a particle moving at a high velocity, its internal \"clock\" (which governs its decay) runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer (the detector).\n\n### **2. Formulate the Mathematical Model**\n\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by:\n`f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame.\n*   `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\nWe can express `t` and `τ_lab` in terms of the problem's parameters:\n*   **Time of Flight (t):** The particles travel the detector radius `R` at a velocity `v`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n*   **Lab-Frame Lifetime (τ_lab):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime measured in the lab is longer than the particle's intrinsic or \"proper\" lifetime `τ₀`. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n\nSubstituting these into the survival equation gives:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThis can be simplified to `f = exp(-K / γ)`, where `K = R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant that depends only on the detector setup and the intrinsic properties of the particle, which do not change between the two scenarios.\n\n### **3. Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**\n\nWe can now use the given information to create a system of two equations.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Equation: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   Survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Equation: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nThe most direct way to solve this is to eliminate the constant `K`. First, take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSince `K` is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nTo get a precise value, we can use a simple calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Derived formula: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe result of this calculation is approximately `54.19`.\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately **54.2**.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their decay must be \"slowed down\" more from the lab's perspective.

This law is fundamentally defined in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   The survival fraction is given by `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_proper / τ)`, where `t_proper` is the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (its proper time), and `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The time measured in the laboratory frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the proper time experienced by the moving particle (`t_proper`) due to time dilation. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_proper`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius, 30 m) in the lab frame. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Combined Formula**: We substitute the expressions for `t_proper` and `t_lab` into the fundamental decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-t_proper / τ) = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ))`\n    This can be written as:\n    `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Solving the Problem**: The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are fixed.

The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the expressions for `t_p` and `t_lab` into the survival equation:\n    `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n6.  **Use the Two Scenarios to Solve:** The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this particle and detector. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`, which gives `K = 20 * ln(3)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂` is unknown.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n        Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`, which gives `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):** Since `K` is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Solving for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms, `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.2.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Frame of Reference:** The decay law must be applied using the particle's proper time, not the lab time directly.\n*   **Time Dilation Application:** The particle's lifetime is effectively extended in the lab frame, or equivalently, the time it experiences during its flight is contracted. Both perspectives lead to the same formula.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that `v ≈ c` is crucial and justified by the problem statement.\n*   **Logical Consistency:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means the Lorentz factor `γ` must be higher. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated value of ~54.2 must be matched to the given options. The value is closest to 54, which is option A.\n\nThe vast majority of the candidate answers correctly derive this formula and calculate this value. The discrepancies arise from incorrectly mapping the result to the final letter option. The correct calculation yields ~54, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Lorentz factor.\n\n### **1. Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles (`f = N/N₀`) that have not decayed after a certain proper time (`t_p`) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of the stationary detector (the lab frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `t_lab = γ * t_p`. This means the particle experiences less time, `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nFirst, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The particles travel the detector's radius (`R` = 30 m) at an \"ultra-relativistic\" velocity, which can be approximated as the speed of light (`c`).\n`t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\nNext, we find the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle during this flight by applying the time dilation formula:\n`t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n\nNow, we substitute this proper time into the exponential decay equation to find the fraction of surviving particles:\n`f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n### **3. Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this by taking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f)`\n\nSince `K` is constant, we can set the expressions from both scenarios equal to each other:\n`-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Result**\n\nWe are given:\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\nThe negative signs on both sides cancel out:\n`20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify this:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3) / -ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the approximate numerical values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### **5. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Logical Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their lifetime in the lab frame must be longer. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Calculation:** The mathematical derivation is robust and consistently yields a value of approximately 54.2 across nearly all provided candidate answers.\n*   **Matching the Answer:** The calculated value of ~54.2 corresponds directly to option D. The inconsistencies in the candidate answers' final letter choices appear to be artifacts, while their underlying calculations are correct.\n\nThe required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key principles are the exponential law of particle decay and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `t_p` is the proper time experienced by the particle and `τ` is its mean proper lifetime.\n\n3.  **Relate Lab Frame to Proper Frame:**\n    *   The time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` in the laboratory's frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the proper time experienced by the particle is shorter than the lab time: `t_p = t_lab / γ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Substituting `t_lab`, we get `t_p = R / (γ * c)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** By substituting the expression for proper time `t_p` into the survival equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp( -(R / (γ * c)) / τ ) = exp( -R / (γ * c * τ) )`\n\n5.  **Use a Ratiometric Method:** The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for `γ` by first taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    `γ * ln(f) = -K`\n    Since `-K` is a constant, the product `γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios.\n\n6.  **Set Up the Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    We can set the products from both scenarios equal to each other:\n    `γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3) / -ln(3/2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** It is crucial to use the time-dilated lifetime (`γτ`) or, equivalently, the proper time (`t/γ`) in the decay equation. A common mistake would be to forget the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The approximation `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the travel time.\n*   **Consistency:** The term `R/(cτ)` is a constant that depends on the detector and the particle type, not on the particle's energy. This allows for the ratiometric comparison between the two scenarios.\n*   **Final Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means the Lorentz factor `γ` must be higher. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~54.18 must be compared to the given options: A) 68, B) 40, C) 54, D) 28. The result is clearly closest to 54.\n\nBased on the consistent derivation and calculation, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a comprehensive step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physics:** The problem combines two fundamental concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time follows an exponential law. This law is fundamentally based on the time elapsed in the particle's own reference frame (its proper time).\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a relativistic velocity experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. This effect, quantified by the Lorentz factor `γ`, means the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab is extended.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of surviving particles is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `t_p` is the proper time experienced by the particle and `τ` is its mean proper lifetime.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is the distance `R` divided by the velocity `v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" we can approximate `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Time dilation connects the lab time and proper time: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time the particle experiences during its flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = R / (γ * c)`.\n    *   Substituting this into the decay equation gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Approach to Solve:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, we can equate its value from both scenarios:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, we can also write this as `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.7095 ≈ 54.19`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** It is essential to use the decay law in terms of the particle's proper time and to correctly apply the time dilation formula. All candidate answers successfully identified and applied this model.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The approximation `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and is crucial for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation.\n*   **Identifying the Constant:** The key to solving the problem without needing the values for `R`, `c`, or `τ` is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant across both scenarios. This allows for the creation of a ratio that eliminates these unknowns.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which in turn requires a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with physical intuition.\n*   **Mapping Value to Option:** The calculated numerical value is approximately **54.19**.

The decay law is fundamentally based on the particle's proper time, but it's often more convenient to work in the lab frame by using the dilated lifetime (`τ_lab`). All candidate answers correctly applied this principle.\n*   **Ultra-Relativistic Approximation**: The problem simplifies the calculation of travel time by stating the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies the approximation `v ≈ c`.\n*   **Identifying Constants**: The key to solving the problem efficiently is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant across both scenarios, allowing for the creation of a ratio or system of equations that eliminates the need to calculate the proper lifetime `τ_proper` or the constant `K` explicitly.\n*   **Logical Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight.

The time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab is `t_lab ≈ R/c` (since they are ultra-relativistic). Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ = R / (γ * c)`.\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** Substituting the expression for `t_p` into the survival equation gives:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n5.  **Establish a Proportionality:** The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. By taking the natural logarithm, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which can be rearranged to `γ * ln(1/f) = K`. Since `K` is constant, the product `γ * ln(1/f)` must be the same in both scenarios.\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown:** We can set up a ratio:\n    `γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n    We are given `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`, and `f₂ = 2/3`.

This requires combining two key concepts:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles decreases exponentially over time. The fundamental law is expressed in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a high velocity experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. This effect is quantified by the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` (time in the particle's own frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   The time the particle takes to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Time dilation connects the lab time and the proper time: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Equation and Set Up a Ratio:**\n    *   The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup, as `R`, `c`, and `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    *   The simplified equation is `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can write:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these values into our ratio equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel out:\n        `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)`), we can rewrite the expression:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

This is justified by the problem statement.\n*   **Constants:** Recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant allows for solving the problem without knowing the particle's proper lifetime or even using the specific value of the detector radius.\n*   **Logical Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay more slowly from the lab's perspective. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means the Lorentz factor `γ` must be higher. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed greater than the initial value (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms our physical intuition.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the formula `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nFirst, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`. The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n*   `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\nNext, we find the proper time `t_p` that passes for the particle during its flight.\n*   `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γc)`\n\nNow, we substitute this proper time into the exponential decay formula to get the fraction of surviving particles `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n*   `f = exp(-t_p / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\nThe term `R / (cτ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n*   `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **3. Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nWe can set up an equation for each scenario and solve for the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTo solve this system, we can take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify `ln(2/3)` to `-ln(3/2)`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nWe can now calculate the value of `γ₂`.\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n### **5.

Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles decreases exponentially over time.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. This means its observed lifetime in the lab frame is longer than its \"proper\" lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory's reference frame is given by:\n`f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame.\n*   `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\nWe need to express `t` and `τ_lab` in terms of the problem's variables:\n*   **Time of Flight (t):** The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n*   **Lab Lifetime (τ_lab):** Due to time dilation, the lab lifetime is related to the particle's proper lifetime, `τ₀`, by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n\nSubstituting these into the survival equation gives:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThis can be simplified by grouping the constants. Let `K = R / (c * τ₀)`. The value of `K` is constant for this specific particle and detector. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **3. Set Up Equations for the Two Scenarios**\n\nWe can now apply this formula to the two situations described in the problem.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Plugging these in: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these in: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nThe most direct way to solve for `γ₂` is to first find an expression for the constant `K` and then equate the two scenarios.\n\n1.  Take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n2.  Take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n    `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n3.  Now, set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  Solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### **6. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Logical Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they need to \"live\" longer in the lab frame. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms our reasoning.\n*   **Constant Parameters:** The solution relies on the fact that the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ₀` are constant between the two experiments.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value of approximately 54.2 is closest to the option **54**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principles:** The problem involves two key concepts: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity. The fraction of particles that survive a journey depends on the time elapsed in their own reference frame (proper time), which is shorter than the time measured in the laboratory due to time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` is given by the decay law: `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`.

The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, we can equate its value from both scenarios:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, we get:\n        `20 * [-ln(3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(3/2)]`\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. This corresponds to option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Frames of Reference:** It is essential to correctly distinguish between the lab frame and the particle's rest frame.

The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n    We can take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for `K`:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`  =>  `K = -γ * ln(f)`\n    Since `K` is constant for both scenarios, we can set them equal:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Conditions:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into our ratio equation:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    The negative signs cancel out:\n    `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Physical Principle:** The core concept is that a higher Lorentz factor leads to greater time dilation, which means the particle's internal clock runs slower relative to the lab. This allows a larger fraction of particles to survive the journey to the detector.

The question lists the options as: A) 40, B) 68, C) 28, D) 54. Therefore, the correct choice is D. Many of the candidate answers incorrectly map their correct calculation to the wrong letter choice.\n\nThe required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Underlying Physics\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time follows the law `f = exp(-t_proper / τ_proper)`, where `t_proper` is the time elapsed in the particle's own reference frame (its proper time) and `τ_proper` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation (Special Relativity):** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time by `t_lab = γ * t_proper`. Therefore, the proper time elapsed during the particle's flight is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Governing Equation\n\n1.  **Time of Flight in Lab Frame (`t_lab`):** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" we can approximate their speed `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). Thus, the time of flight in the lab is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n2.  **Proper Time of Flight (`t_proper`):** Substituting `t_lab` into the time dilation formula, we find the time experienced by the particle: `t_proper = (R / c) / γ = R / (γc)`.\n3.  **Survival Fraction Formula:** Now, we substitute this expression for `t_proper` into the exponential decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t_proper / τ_proper) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### 3. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)\n\nWe have two scenarios, which allows us to solve for `γ₂`.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂ = ?`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nWe can solve this system by creating a ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `K`. First, take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  => `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Numerical Value\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly derive the formula and arrive at the same numerical result of approximately 54.2.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated value of ~54.19 is closest to the numerical option 54. According to the question's list of options:\n    A) 28\n    B) 68\n    C) 54\n    D) 40\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles decreases exponentially over time.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving clock runs slower than a stationary one. For a particle moving at a high velocity, its internal \"clock\" (which governs its decay) runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer (the detector).\n\n### **2. Formulate the Mathematical Model**\n\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by:\n`f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame.\n*   `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\nWe can express `t` and `τ_lab` in terms of the problem's parameters:\n*   **Time of Flight (t):** The particles travel the detector radius `R` at a velocity `v`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n*   **Lab-Frame Lifetime (τ_lab):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime measured in the lab is longer than the particle's intrinsic or \"proper\" lifetime `τ₀`. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n\nSubstituting these into the survival equation gives:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThis can be simplified to `f = exp(-K / γ)`, where `K = R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant that depends only on the detector setup and the intrinsic properties of the particle, which do not change between the two scenarios.\n\n### **3. Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**\n\nWe can now use the given information to create a system of two equations.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Equation: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   Survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Equation: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nThe most direct way to solve this is to eliminate the constant `K`. First, take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSince `K` is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nTo get a precise value, we can use a simple calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Derived formula: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe result of this calculation is approximately `54.19`.\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately **54.2**.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their decay must be \"slowed down\" more from the lab's perspective. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms our physical intuition.\n\nComparing the result `54.19` to the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 40\nC) 28\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 54.1902258270291\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires us to relate the fraction of surviving particles to their Lorentz factor using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Fundamental Physics**: The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law. This law is fundamentally defined in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   The survival fraction is given by `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_proper / τ)`, where `t_proper` is the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (its proper time), and `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The time measured in the laboratory frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the proper time experienced by the moving particle (`t_proper`) due to time dilation. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_proper`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius, 30 m) in the lab frame. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Combined Formula**: We substitute the expressions for `t_proper` and `t_lab` into the fundamental decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-t_proper / τ) = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ))`\n    This can be written as:\n    `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Solving the Problem**: The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are fixed. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can now use the two scenarios to solve for the unknown Lorentz factor `γ₂`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: `f₁ = 1/3`, `γ₁ = 20`\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2**: `f₂ = 2/3`, `γ₂ = ?`\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n    To solve this system, we can take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n    1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20  =>  K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂  =>  γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify `ln(2/3)` to `-ln(3/2)`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2)) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculation**:\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18`\n\n    The calculated value is approximately **54.2**.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Comparing the calculated value with the given options:\n    A) 68\n    B) 40\n    C) 28\n    D) 54\n\n    The result `54.2` is closest to **54**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Frame of Reference**: It is crucial to use the proper time (`t_proper`) in the exponent of the decay law. The time dilation formula (`t_lab = γ * t_proper`) is the bridge between the lab frame and the particle's rest frame.\n*   **Logical Check**: To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Constant Term**: Recognizing that `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for both scenarios is the key to setting up a solvable system of equations.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the underlying physics, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physics:** The problem combines two key concepts: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by the exponential decay law. The time in the exponent must be the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle, and the lifetime must be the proper mean lifetime (`τ`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n\n3.  **Relate Lab Time to Proper Time:** The time measured in the laboratory frame (`t_lab`) is dilated relative to the proper time experienced by the moving particle. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_p`  or  `t_p = t_lab / γ`\n\n4.  **Calculate Lab Time of Flight:** The particles travel the radius of the detector, `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the expressions for `t_p` and `t_lab` into the survival equation:\n    `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n6.  **Use the Two Scenarios to Solve:** The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this particle and detector.

Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles (`f = N/N₀`) that have not decayed after a certain proper time (`t_p`) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of the stationary detector (the lab frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `t_lab = γ * t_p`. This means the particle experiences less time, `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nFirst, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The particles travel the detector's radius (`R` = 30 m) at an \"ultra-relativistic\" velocity, which can be approximated as the speed of light (`c`).\n`t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\nNext, we find the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle during this flight by applying the time dilation formula:\n`t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n\nNow, we substitute this proper time into the exponential decay equation to find the fraction of surviving particles:\n`f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n### **3. Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios.

The key principles are the exponential law of particle decay and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `t_p` is the proper time experienced by the particle and `τ` is its mean proper lifetime.\n\n3.  **Relate Lab Frame to Proper Frame:**\n    *   The time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R` in the laboratory's frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the proper time experienced by the particle is shorter than the lab time: `t_p = t_lab / γ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Substituting `t_lab`, we get `t_p = R / (γ * c)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** By substituting the expression for proper time `t_p` into the survival equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp( -(R / (γ * c)) / τ ) = exp( -R / (γ * c * τ) )`\n\n5.  **Use a Ratiometric Method:** The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for `γ` by first taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    `γ * ln(f) = -K`\n    Since `-K` is a constant, the product `γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios.\n\n6.  **Set Up the Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    We can set the products from both scenarios equal to each other:\n    `γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3) / -ln(3/2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** It is crucial to use the time-dilated lifetime (`γτ`) or, equivalently, the proper time (`t/γ`) in the decay equation. A common mistake would be to forget the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The approximation `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the travel time.\n*   **Consistency:** The term `R/(cτ)` is a constant that depends on the detector and the particle type, not on the particle's energy. This allows for the ratiometric comparison between the two scenarios.\n*   **Final Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means the Lorentz factor `γ` must be higher. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~54.18 must be compared to the given options: A) 68, B) 40, C) 54, D) 28. The result is clearly closest to 54.\n\nBased on the consistent derivation and calculation, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
