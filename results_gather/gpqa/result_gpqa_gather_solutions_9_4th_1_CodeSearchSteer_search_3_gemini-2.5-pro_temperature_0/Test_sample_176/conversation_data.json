Since the stars are treated as black bodies, the solution requires three key physical laws:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (and thus its radius R squared) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio of luminosities is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). The temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the motion of a source affects the wavelength of light we *observe* (λ_obs). It connects the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength using the formula:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. The first part of the luminosity ratio is therefore:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This is the most complex part and requires careful distinction between observed and emitted wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength, meaning λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths, which determine the temperature.\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio using Wien's Law, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation gives:\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**\n\n4.  **Combine Terms and Perform Final Calculation:** Substitute the derived radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.229. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.23\n    C) ~2.35\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** This is the most crucial point of the problem. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, which is the same for both stars. However, Wien's Law, which determines temperature, depends on the *emitted* peak wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential bridge between these two concepts.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common mistake is to ignore the Doppler effect. If one assumes that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂), the luminosity ratio would simply be (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25. This corresponds to option D and is incorrect because it ignores the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to a calculation based on black-body radiation principles and should be ignored as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember the correct powers from the Stefan-Boltzmann law: the radius ratio is squared (²), and the temperature ratio is raised to the fourth power (⁴).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, a clear and consistent method for solving the problem emerges. All correct analyses converge on the same physical principles and numerical result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Foundational Formula:** The objective is to find the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂. For stars treated as black bodies, the Stefan-Boltzmann law provides the governing equation for the ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Squaring this ratio gives the first component of the equation:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This step is the most complex and requires the synthesis of two additional physical laws.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that a star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **The Doppler Effect** relates the *emitted* wavelength to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) based on the star's radial velocity (v_r). The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength, which means their **observed** peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   **Connecting the laws:**\n        *   For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0, there is no Doppler shift, so: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   To find the temperature ratio, we rearrange this to get the ratio of emitted wavelengths: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the derived ratios for the radius and temperature into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the numerical values v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s:\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    *   A) ~2.32\n    *   B) ~2.25\n    *   C) ~2.35\n    *   D) ~2.23\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** This is the most crucial concept in the problem. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, which is affected by motion. Wien's Law, which determines temperature, relies on the intrinsic *emitted* peak wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential bridge between these two concepts.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). This ignores the provided radial velocity data and leads to the incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option B), which is a deliberately placed distractor.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to the laws of black body radiation (Stefan-Boltzmann, Wien's) and serves only as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember that in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity is proportional to the radius **squared** (R²) and the temperature to the **fourth power** (T⁴).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by synthesizing the correct methodology identified in the candidate answers. The core of the problem is to calculate the luminosity ratio of two stars, which requires combining three key physical principles: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler Effect.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Establish the Luminosity Ratio Formula:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law (L ∝ R²T⁴), the primary formula is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem gives R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so this term is simply (1.5)², which equals 2.25.\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:** This is the most critical step. I will show how the Doppler effect links the *observed* peak wavelength (which is the same for both stars) to the *emitted* peak wavelength (which determines temperature via Wien's Law). This will yield the formula for the temperature ratio: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n4.  **Final Calculation:** I will substitute the radius and temperature terms into the main formula and use Python to compute the precise numerical result.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated value will be compared against the provided options to determine the correct choice.\n\nI will also highlight the following careful points that are crucial for avoiding common mistakes:\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), but Wien's Law requires the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential bridge.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common error is to ignore the velocity data. If one assumes that equal observed wavelengths mean equal temperatures, the answer would incorrectly be 2.25 (Option B).\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio is a distractor and is not needed for this black-body radiation problem.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The radius ratio must be squared, and the temperature ratio must be raised to the fourth power.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and physical constants.\n# The ratio of the radius of Star_1 to Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s.\nv2_kms = 700\n# The speed of light in km/s.

Since the stars are treated as black bodies, their luminosity is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio of luminosities is therefore:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).

The problem assumes they radiate as black bodies, which requires the application of three core physical principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (and thus its radius squared, R²) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T⁴). The formula for the ratio is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted from the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) due to the source's radial velocity (v_r).

This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength, meaning λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths, which determine the temperature via Wien's Law.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0 km/s), there is no Doppler shift, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s), its light is redshifted (moving away), so its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the two expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation gives:\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The previous step's code execution confirmed the calculation.

The formula for the ratio of luminosities is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). The temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the motion of a source affects the wavelength of light we *observe* (λ_obs). It connects the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength using the formula:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. The first part of the luminosity ratio is therefore:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This is the most complex part and requires careful distinction between observed and emitted wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength, meaning λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths, which determine the temperature.\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio using Wien's Law, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation gives:\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**\n\n4.  **Combine Terms and Perform Final Calculation:** Substitute the derived radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.229. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.23\n    C) ~2.35\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** This is the most crucial point of the problem. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, which is the same for both stars. However, Wien's Law, which determines temperature, depends on the *emitted* peak wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential bridge between these two concepts.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common mistake is to ignore the Doppler effect. If one assumes that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂), the luminosity ratio would simply be (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25. This corresponds to option D and is incorrect because it ignores the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to a calculation based on black-body radiation principles and should be ignored as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember the correct powers from the Stefan-Boltzmann law: the radius ratio is squared (²), and the temperature ratio is raised to the fourth power (⁴).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, a clear and consistent method for solving the problem emerges. All correct analyses converge on the same physical principles and numerical result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Foundational Formula:** The objective is to find the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂. For stars treated as black bodies, the Stefan-Boltzmann law provides the governing equation for the ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Squaring this ratio gives the first component of the equation:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This step is the most complex and requires the synthesis of two additional physical laws.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** states that a star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **The Doppler Effect** relates the *emitted* wavelength to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) based on the star's radial velocity (v_r). The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength, which means their **observed** peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   **Connecting the laws:**\n        *   For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0, there is no Doppler shift, so: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   To find the temperature ratio, we rearrange this to get the ratio of emitted wavelengths: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the derived ratios for the radius and temperature into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the numerical values v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s:\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, which is affected by motion. Wien's Law, which determines temperature, relies on the intrinsic *emitted* peak wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential bridge between these two concepts.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). This ignores the provided radial velocity data and leads to the incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option B), which is a deliberately placed distractor.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to the laws of black body radiation (Stefan-Boltzmann, Wien's) and serves only as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember that in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity is proportional to the radius **squared** (R²) and the temperature to the **fourth power** (T⁴).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by synthesizing the correct methodology identified in the candidate answers. The core of the problem is to calculate the luminosity ratio of two stars, which requires combining three key physical principles: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler Effect.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Establish the Luminosity Ratio Formula:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law (L ∝ R²T⁴), the primary formula is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem gives R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so this term is simply (1.5)², which equals 2.25.\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:** This is the most critical step. I will show how the Doppler effect links the *observed* peak wavelength (which is the same for both stars) to the *emitted* peak wavelength (which determines temperature via Wien's Law). This will yield the formula for the temperature ratio: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n4.  **Final Calculation:** I will substitute the radius and temperature terms into the main formula and use Python to compute the precise numerical result.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated value will be compared against the provided options to determine the correct choice.\n\nI will also highlight the following careful points that are crucial for avoiding common mistakes:\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), but Wien's Law requires the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential bridge.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common error is to ignore the velocity data. If one assumes that equal observed wavelengths mean equal temperatures, the answer would incorrectly be 2.25 (Option B).\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio is a distractor and is not needed for this black-body radiation problem.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The radius ratio must be squared, and the temperature ratio must be raised to the fourth power.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and physical constants.\n# The ratio of the radius of Star_1 to Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s.\nv2_kms = 700\n# The speed of light in km/s.

Since the stars are treated as black bodies, their luminosity is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio of luminosities is therefore:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).

This corresponds to option D and is incorrect because it ignores the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to a calculation based on black-body radiation principles and should be ignored as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The radius ratio must be squared, and the temperature ratio must be raised to the fourth power, as dictated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Laws:**\n    The objective is to find the luminosity ratio, L₁/L₂, between two stars. The problem assumes they radiate as black bodies, which requires the application of three core physical principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (and thus its radius squared, R²) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T⁴). The formula for the ratio is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted from the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) due to the source's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:**\n    The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of the luminosity ratio formula is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):**\n    This is the most complex part and requires a careful distinction between observed and emitted wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength, meaning λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths, which determine the temperature via Wien's Law.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0 km/s), there is no Doppler shift, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s), its light is redshifted (moving away), so its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the two expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation gives:\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The previous step's code execution confirmed the calculation. The luminosity ratio is found by substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the main formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    Using the values v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 299792.458 km/s, the calculation yields:\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.2291.

Thus, its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, with a radial velocity v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is given by: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the expressions for them equal to each other: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁).
