The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to stem from the agents being presented with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Properties and Q-value**\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relations:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment) and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which leads to `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the mass defect, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. The kinetic energies are therefore inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we substitute the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The key equation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Since the momenta are equal, we can set `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    Substituting the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplifying the equation gives:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Difference**\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT₁ = T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All provided candidate answers that show detailed work correctly calculate the numerical difference to be **5 MeV**. This high level of agreement confirms the result.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` formulas, both derived from the principle of momentum conservation.\n*   **Source of Error in Candidate Answers:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers is not in the physics or the calculation, but in mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the multiple-choice letters. The agents were likely presented with different, randomized orderings of the options.\n*   **Final Decision:** Based on the robust and unanimously confirmed calculation, the correct numerical answer is 5 MeV. According to the options provided in the question (`A) 20 MeV, B) 2 MeV, C) 10 MeV, D) 5 MeV`), this corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the underlying physics problem, the following is a definitive solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fission fragment (`T₁`) using both relativistic (correct) and classical (approximate) mechanics, and then find the difference.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis foundational step was performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n*   **Given:** Initial rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The fragments have masses `m₁` and `m₂` such that `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Masses:** Substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step provides the baseline for comparison and was also calculated consistently by all agents.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using the formula `T = p² / (2m)`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** From `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class` and the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which results in `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step, requiring the application of special relativity.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The correct relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert it to the appropriate units.\n*   **Difference** = `T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers that performed the calculation: the numerical result is **5 MeV**. This high level of agreement confirms the validity of the physical and mathematical steps.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem is the distinction between the classical kinetic energy formula (`T = p²/2m`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation (`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`). This distinction was handled correctly in the detailed analyses.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the conservation of momentum (which holds in both frameworks) and the conservation of total energy.\n*   **Option Mapping Discrepancy:** The only source of disagreement among the candidate answers is in the final step of mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the multiple-choice letter. The candidates appear to have been presented with different orderings of the options (A, B, C, D). The final decision must be based on the options as presented in the question.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct (relativistic) and the approximate (classical) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **5 MeV**. Based on the options provided in the question:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve the problem from first principles to verify the calculations presented in the candidate answers. The analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the numerical result, but significant confusion in mapping that result to the correct multiple-choice letter. My approach will be to:\n\n1.  **Calculate Fragment Properties:** Determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) based on the given relationships.\n2.  **Calculate Q-value:** Find the total kinetic energy (`Q`) released in the fission, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n3.  **Calculate Classical T₁:** Determine the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using the non-relativistic (classical) approximation, where kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to mass.\n4.  **Calculate Relativistic T₁:** Find the correct kinetic energy of the massive fragment (`T₁`) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. This is the most complex step and requires careful application of conservation laws.\n5.  **Compute the Difference:** Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T₁`.\n6.  **Final Answer Selection:** Convert the result to MeV and programmatically select the corresponding option from the provided list to avoid the mapping errors seen in the candidate answers.\n\nHere are the careful points identified from analyzing the candidate answers:\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All detailed candidate answers correctly calculate the numerical difference to be 5 MeV. This provides high confidence in the physical and mathematical steps.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** The distinction between the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` is critical and was handled correctly in the detailed analyses.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are most easily performed in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. A final conversion (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`) is a necessary and correctly applied step.\n*   **Option Mapping Error:** The primary source of discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the calculation itself, but in incorrectly mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the given multiple-choice letters (A, B, C, D). This is likely due to the agents being presented with inconsistent option lists. My code will use the specific list from the prompt to ensure the correct final choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fission_energy_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the fission problem by calculating the kinetic energy of the\n    more massive fragment using both classical and relativistic mechanics, and then\n    finds the difference.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Define the problem's constants and options\n    Mc2_GeV = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\n    options = {'A': 10.0, 'B': 5.0, 'C': 2.0, 'D': 20.0}\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate Fragment Properties\n    # Given: m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99*M\n    # In terms of rest-mass energy: m1c^2 = 2*m2c^2 and m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99*Mc^2\n    # 2*m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * Mc2_GeV\n    # 3*m2c^2 = 0.99 * Mc2_GeV\n    m2c2_GeV = (0.99 * Mc2_GeV) / 3.0\n    m1c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2c2_GeV\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy Released)\n    # Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy\n    Q_GeV = Mc2_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate Classical T1\n    # In classical mechanics, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2, so T2 = 2*T1.\n    # T1 + T2 = Q => T1 + 2*T1 = Q => 3*T1 = Q\n    T1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / 3.0\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate Relativistic T1\n    # From conservation of momentum (p1=p2), we use the relativistic relation:\n    # (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2\n    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2\n    # Substitute T2 = Q - T1:\n    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c^2\n    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*m2c^2 - 2*T1*m2c^2\n    # The T1^2 terms cancel.

Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis is the first and most fundamental step. We are given the initial rest-mass energy and relationships between the fragment masses.\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis calculation provides the baseline value for comparison.\n*   **Principle:** Due to conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert units.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem is the distinction between `T = p²/(2m)` (classical) and `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` (relativistic).\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are applied, but their mathematical forms differ between the two frameworks.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All calculations were performed in GeV, with a final conversion to MeV to match the options. This avoids rounding errors.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly calculate the numerical result to be 5 MeV. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options. The calculation itself is robust and unanimously confirmed.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Based on the options provided in the question:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers and performing an independent verification.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Define Variables**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Given Relationships:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation). The difference is `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step is foundational and was performed correctly by all agents who showed their work.\n1.  We have a system of two equations. We can express them in terms of rest-mass energy (`mc²`):\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n3.  Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n2.  **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n3.  **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is `1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n4.  **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n2.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship between kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n3.  **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n4.  **Solving for T₁:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then solve the remaining linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert the units.\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** There is a remarkable consensus among all candidate answers. Every agent that performed the calculation correctly arrived at the numerical result of **5 MeV**. The physics and mathematical steps are robust.\n*   **Key Physics Concepts:** The solution correctly relies on the conservation of energy and momentum. The crucial part is applying the correct formulas for kinetic energy and momentum in both the classical and relativistic regimes.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are most conveniently done in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. The conversion `0.005 GeV = 5 MeV` is a necessary final step.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The primary source of discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the calculation but in mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the lettered options. It appears the agents were working with different or scrambled lists of options.\n*   **Final Decision:** The calculated difference is unambiguously 5 MeV. Based on the options provided in the question:\n    A) 5 MeV.\n    B) 2 MeV.\n    C) 20 MeV.\n    D) 10 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the problem, here is a definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires finding the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fission fragment (`T₁`) as calculated using correct relativistic mechanics and as calculated using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Properties and Q-value**\n\nFirst, we must find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments and the total kinetic energy released in the fission.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂`\n    *   Sum of masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n*   **Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  This yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  The rest-mass energies are:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculation of Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    *   The energy released (Q-value) is the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments: `Q = T₁ + T₂`.\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Principle:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n    3.  This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    4.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Substituting the ratio gives `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, so `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    6.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. A more direct formula relating kinetic energy `T` to momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   The options are in MeV, so we convert the result: `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All provided candidate answers that performed the full calculation correctly arrived at the numerical result of 5 MeV. This high level of agreement confirms the validity of the physical and mathematical steps.\n*   **Distinction between Formulas:** It is critical to use the classical kinetic energy formula `T = p²/(2m)` for the approximation and the relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` for the correct value.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the conservation of energy and momentum. The initial state (nucleus at rest) provides the crucial starting point of zero momentum and total energy equal to `Mc²`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are performed in GeV, but the final answer must be converted to MeV, a common source of error in physics problems.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that while the numerical result of 5 MeV was consistently reached, the final letter choice varied. This is because the agents were likely presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The final decision must be based on the options provided in this specific problem context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.

Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculation of Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis provides the baseline value for comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Due to the conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta. In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁`.\n    2.  Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis step requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 4: Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert units.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The analysis of all candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical result of 5 MeV. The physics and the mathematical steps are sound.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` relations, both stemming from the conservation of momentum.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are most conveniently performed in GeV, but the options are given in MeV. The final conversion is a crucial step that must not be overlooked.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The candidate answers show significant confusion in mapping the calculated result (5 MeV) to the correct lettered option. This is likely because they were generated against different or randomized option lists. The calculation itself is robustly confirmed.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.

The fragments have masses `m₁` and `m₂` such that `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  This yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  The rest-mass energies are:\n        *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step provides the baseline for comparison and was also calculated correctly by all candidates.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using the formula `T = p² / (2m)`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** From `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class` and the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This results in `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step, requiring the use of relativistic formulas.

The fragments have masses `m₁` and `m₂` such that `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for masses:** Substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the mass defect, `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nThis step provides the baseline for comparison and is also performed consistently and correctly.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\nThis is the most complex step, but the candidate answers correctly apply relativistic principles.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since `E = T + mc²`, this can be written as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Difference**\nThis is the final calculation.\n*   **Difference = T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical**\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Conversion to MeV:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Calculation Consistency:** The most important takeaway from the candidate answers is that every single one that shows its work arrives at the same numerical result: **5 MeV**. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the physics and the mathematical steps.\n2.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` formulas, both derived from the principle of momentum conservation.\n3.  **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are most conveniently performed in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. The final conversion step (`0.005 GeV = 5 MeV`) is crucial.\n4.  **The Critical Error Source (Option Mapping):** The discrepancies in the final letter answers from the agents are not due to calculation errors, but rather from confusion about the multiple-choice options.

Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis is the foundational step to establish the energy parameters of the system after fission.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of final masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  This solves to `m₂ = 0.33M` and therefore `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.

Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis provides the baseline value for our comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Due to the conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio gives `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis requires using the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then solve the resulting linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert the units.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are in MeV, so we convert our result (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Calculation Consensus:** An analysis of all 15 candidate answers shows that every agent that performed the calculation arrived at the same numerical result: **5 MeV**. This provides very high confidence in the correctness of the physical and mathematical steps.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The key to the problem is correctly applying the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` formulas, both stemming from the conservation of momentum.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculation is most conveniently performed in GeV, but the final answer must be converted to MeV, a step that was also handled correctly in the candidate analyses.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculated difference is 5 MeV. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 5 MeV.\n    *   B) 2 MeV.\n    *   C) 10 MeV.\n    *   D) 20 MeV.\n\nThe calculated result of 5 MeV corresponds directly to option A.

In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio gives `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which solves to `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds, but the relationship between energy and momentum is now `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplifying the linear equation gives: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solving for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which results in `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert the units.\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT₁ = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`.\n*   `ΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are in MeV, so we convert the result (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n    `ΔT₁ = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The step-by-step calculation is robust. Every single candidate answer that showed its work arrived at the same numerical result of **5 MeV**. This provides very high confidence in the calculated value.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying two different sets of formulas (classical `T = p²/2m` vs. relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`) derived from the same conservation principle (conservation of momentum).\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculation is most conveniently done in GeV, but the final answer must be converted to MeV, a crucial last step.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that the sole source of disagreement was in mapping the final numerical result (5 MeV) to the correct lettered option. This was likely caused by the agents working from inconsistent lists of options.

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a rigorous step-by-step verification of the problem, the following is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core task is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using correct relativistic mechanics and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, we establish the energy parameters of the system after the fission event.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of final masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    1.  We can express the relationships in terms of rest-mass energy: `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²` and `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc²`.\n    2.  Substituting the known `Mc²`: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    3.  Now, substitute the mass ratio into this sum: `2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which gives `3m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n    4.  Solving for the individual rest-mass energies:\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Calculation of Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis provides the approximate value for comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum dictates that the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Formula:** The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n    2.  This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis step requires the use of formulas from special relativity.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds, but the relationship between kinetic energy `T`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is now `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can then solve the remaining linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert the units to match the options.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consensus:** The most important observation from the candidate answers is that every single one that performed the full calculation arrived at the same numerical result: **5 MeV**. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the physics and the mathematical steps.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem is the distinction between the classical kinetic energy formula (`T = p²/2m`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation (`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`). Both formulas are applied under the principle of momentum conservation.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on two conservation laws: conservation of total energy (used to find the Q-value from the mass defect) and conservation of momentum (used to relate the kinetic energies of the two fragments).\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are most conveniently performed in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. The final conversion (`0.005 GeV = 5 MeV`) is a simple but critical step.\n*   **Option Mapping Discrepancy:** The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that the *only* source of disagreement was in the final letter choice. This is clearly because the agents were presented with different, randomized orderings of the multiple-choice options. The final decision must be based solely on the options as presented in the original question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct (relativistic) and the approximate (classical) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **5 MeV**.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to stem from the agents being presented with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Properties and Q-value**\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relations:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment) and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which leads to `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the mass defect, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. The kinetic energies are therefore inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we substitute the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The key equation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Since the momenta are equal, we can set `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    Substituting the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplifying the equation gives:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Difference**\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT₁ = T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All provided candidate answers that show detailed work correctly calculate the numerical difference to be **5 MeV**. This high level of agreement confirms the result.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` formulas, both derived from the principle of momentum conservation.\n*   **Source of Error in Candidate Answers:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers is not in the physics or the calculation, but in mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the multiple-choice letters. The agents were likely presented with different, randomized orderings of the options.\n*   **Final Decision:** Based on the robust and unanimously confirmed calculation, the correct numerical answer is 5 MeV. According to the options provided in the question (`A) 20 MeV, B) 2 MeV, C) 10 MeV, D) 5 MeV`), this corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the underlying physics problem, the following is a definitive solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fission fragment (`T₁`) using both relativistic (correct) and classical (approximate) mechanics, and then find the difference.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis foundational step was performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n*   **Given:** Initial rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The fragments have masses `m₁` and `m₂` such that `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Masses:** Substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step provides the baseline for comparison and was also calculated consistently by all agents.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using the formula `T = p² / (2m)`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** From `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class` and the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which results in `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step, requiring the application of special relativity.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The correct relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert it to the appropriate units.\n*   **Difference** = `T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers that performed the calculation: the numerical result is **5 MeV**.

Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis is the first and most fundamental step. We are given the initial rest-mass energy and relationships between the fragment masses.\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis calculation provides the baseline value for comparison.\n*   **Principle:** Due to conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert units.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem is the distinction between `T = p²/(2m)` (classical) and `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` (relativistic).\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are applied, but their mathematical forms differ between the two frameworks.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All calculations were performed in GeV, with a final conversion to MeV to match the options. This avoids rounding errors.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly calculate the numerical result to be 5 MeV. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options. The calculation itself is robust and unanimously confirmed.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Based on the options provided in the question:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers and performing an independent verification.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Define Variables**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Given Relationships:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation). The difference is `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step is foundational and was performed correctly by all agents who showed their work.\n1.  We have a system of two equations. We can express them in terms of rest-mass energy (`mc²`):\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n3.  Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n2.  **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n3.  **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is `1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n4.  **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n2.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship between kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n3.  **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n4.  **Solving for T₁:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then solve the remaining linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert the units.\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** There is a remarkable consensus among all candidate answers. Every agent that performed the calculation correctly arrived at the numerical result of **5 MeV**. The physics and mathematical steps are robust.\n*   **Key Physics Concepts:** The solution correctly relies on the conservation of energy and momentum. The crucial part is applying the correct formulas for kinetic energy and momentum in both the classical and relativistic regimes.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are most conveniently done in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. The conversion `0.005 GeV = 5 MeV` is a necessary final step.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The primary source of discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the calculation but in mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the lettered options. It appears the agents were working with different or scrambled lists of options.\n*   **Final Decision:** The calculated difference is unambiguously 5 MeV. Based on the options provided in the question:\n    A) 5 MeV.\n    B) 2 MeV.\n    C) 20 MeV.\n    D) 10 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the problem, here is a definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires finding the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fission fragment (`T₁`) as calculated using correct relativistic mechanics and as calculated using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Properties and Q-value**\n\nFirst, we must find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments and the total kinetic energy released in the fission.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂`\n    *   Sum of masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n*   **Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  This yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  The rest-mass energies are:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculation of Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    *   The energy released (Q-value) is the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments: `Q = T₁ + T₂`.\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Principle:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n    3.  This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    4.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Substituting the ratio gives `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, so `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    6.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds, but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. A more direct formula relating kinetic energy `T` to momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   The options are in MeV, so we convert the result: `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All provided candidate answers that performed the full calculation correctly arrived at the numerical result of 5 MeV. This high level of agreement confirms the validity of the physical and mathematical steps.\n*   **Distinction between Formulas:** It is critical to use the classical kinetic energy formula `T = p²/(2m)` for the approximation and the relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` for the correct value.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the conservation of energy and momentum. The initial state (nucleus at rest) provides the crucial starting point of zero momentum and total energy equal to `Mc²`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are performed in GeV, but the final answer must be converted to MeV, a common source of error in physics problems.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that while the numerical result of 5 MeV was consistently reached, the final letter choice varied. This is because the agents were likely presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The final decision must be based on the options provided in this specific problem context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct methodology from the provided answers and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\nThis initial step establishes the energy parameters for the rest of the problem.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculation of Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis provides the baseline value for comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Due to the conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta. In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁`.\n    2.  Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis step requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.

The fragments have masses `m₁` and `m₂` such that `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  This yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  The rest-mass energies are:\n        *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step provides the baseline for comparison and was also calculated correctly by all candidates.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using the formula `T = p² / (2m)`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** From `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class` and the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This results in `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step, requiring the use of relativistic formulas. The candidate answers correctly applied the principles.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference and convert the units.\n*   **Difference** = `T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Calculation Consistency:** There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers that the numerical result of the calculation is **5 MeV**. This high level of agreement confirms the validity of the physical and mathematical steps.\n2.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the classical `T = p²/2m` for the approximation and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` for the correct value.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The problem relies on the correct application of both conservation of momentum (which dictates that `p₁ = p₂`) and conservation of energy (which dictates that the mass defect becomes the total kinetic energy, `Q`).\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are performed in GeV, but the options are in MeV. The final conversion is a simple but critical step that was performed correctly by all agents.\n5.  **Option Mapping:** The only point of disagreement among the candidate answers is the final letter choice. This is because the agents were likely working with differently ordered lists of options. The decision must be based on the options as stated in the problem description:\n    *   A) 10 MeV.\n    *   B) 2 MeV.\n    *   C) 5 MeV.\n    *   D) 20 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference of 5 MeV corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers and highlighting the careful points required for a correct solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis is the foundational step to establish the parameters of the system after fission. All candidate answers that showed their work performed this step correctly.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of final masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis provides the approximate value for comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Due to conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Formula:** Kinetic energy `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n    2.  This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert units.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Calculation Consensus:** There is a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers that the numerical result of the calculation is **5 MeV**. This provides very high confidence in the correctness of the physics and mathematical steps.\n2.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem is the distinction between the classical kinetic energy formula (`T = p²/2m`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relation (`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`). The agents correctly applied both.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the conservation of momentum (which holds that `p₁ = p₂` in both frameworks) and the conservation of total energy (which allows for the calculation of the Q-value).\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are performed in GeV, but the final options are in MeV. The conversion `0.005 GeV = 5 MeV` is a crucial final step.\n5.  **Option Mapping:** The primary source of discrepancy among the candidate answers was not in the calculation, but in mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the correct lettered option. This suggests the agents were working with inconsistent lists of options.

Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\nThis is the most complex step, but the candidate answers correctly apply relativistic principles.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since `E = T + mc²`, this can be written as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Difference**\nThis is the final calculation.\n*   **Difference = T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical**\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Conversion to MeV:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Calculation Consistency:** The most important takeaway from the candidate answers is that every single one that shows its work arrives at the same numerical result: **5 MeV**. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the physics and the mathematical steps.\n2.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` formulas, both derived from the principle of momentum conservation.\n3.  **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are most conveniently performed in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. The final conversion step (`0.005 GeV = 5 MeV`) is crucial.\n4.  **The Critical Error Source (Option Mapping):** The discrepancies in the final letter answers from the agents are not due to calculation errors, but rather from confusion about the multiple-choice options. The agents appear to have been presented with different orderings of the options. The final decision must be based on the options as stated in the problem description provided.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a difference of **5 MeV**.

Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis is the foundational step to establish the energy parameters of the system after fission.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of final masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  This solves to `m₂ = 0.33M` and therefore `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  The rest-mass energies of the fragments are:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis provides the baseline value for our comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Due to the conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio gives `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis requires using the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then solve the resulting linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert the units.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The options are in MeV, so we convert our result (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Calculation Consensus:** An analysis of all 15 candidate answers shows that every agent that performed the calculation arrived at the same numerical result: **5 MeV**. This provides very high confidence in the correctness of the physical and mathematical steps.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The key to the problem is correctly applying the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` formulas, both stemming from the conservation of momentum.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculation is most conveniently performed in GeV, but the final answer must be converted to MeV, a step that was also handled correctly in the candidate analyses.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculated difference is 5 MeV. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 5 MeV.\n    *   B) 2 MeV.\n    *   C) 10 MeV.\n    *   D) 20 MeV.\n\nThe calculated result of 5 MeV corresponds directly to option A. The confusion in the candidate answers appears to stem from being presented with differently ordered lists of options, but the numerical result is unambiguous.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a rigorous, step-by-step verification of the problem, the following is the consolidated solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires finding the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fission fragment (`T₁`) as calculated using correct relativistic mechanics and as calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis initial step establishes the key energy values for the system.\n*   **Given:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. It splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`, with the relationships `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Masses:** We can solve this system of equations. Substituting the first into the second gives `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`, yielding `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Calculating Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis provides the baseline value for our comparison.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using the formula `T = p² / (2m)`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** With `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class` and the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we find `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`. This gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can equate the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplifying the linear equation gives: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`.\n    *   `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference and convert the units.\n*   **Difference** = `T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All provided candidate answers that performed the full calculation correctly arrived at the numerical result of **5 MeV**. This high level of agreement confirms the validity of the physical and mathematical steps.\n*   **Relativistic Formula:** The most complex step is the relativistic calculation. It is crucial to use the correct energy-momentum relation, `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`, and not the classical one.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The calculations are most conveniently performed in GeV, but the final options are in MeV. The conversion at the end is a critical step that must not be overlooked.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The analysis of the candidate answers reveals that the primary source of error was not in the calculation itself, but in mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the correct multiple-choice letter. This was likely due to the agents being presented with differently ordered lists of options.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe calculation robustly and unambiguously yields a difference of **5 MeV**.

Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  This leads to `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.

Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis provides the baseline value for our comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Due to the conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio gives `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which solves to `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds, but the relationship between energy and momentum is now `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplifying the linear equation gives: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.
