All candidate molecules fit this formula. The 1:1 ratio is crucial for interpreting the integrations.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   The fact that all signals are **singlets** is a powerful clue. It immediately rules out any compound with coupled aliphatic protons, such as the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (4 x CH₃). In a 1:1 mixture, the total aliphatic proton count is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. This strongly suggests that the mixture contains two compounds that each produce one aromatic signal representing the same number of protons (e.g., two 2H singlets).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThis is the most critical step and requires a careful analysis of molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** Contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) which produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated** because the data specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region. This rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This molecule has low symmetry. The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups (C3-Me and C5-Me), while H6 is between a methyl group (C1-Me) and another methyl group (C5-Me), but the overall substitution pattern is not symmetric with respect to them. Therefore, this compound produces **two distinct 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any mixture containing Isodurene would show at least three aromatic signals (the two 1H signals from Isodurene plus at least one from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only **two** aromatic signals. Therefore, Isodurene can be **eliminated**. This rules out **Option C** and **Option D**.\n\n3.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Option**\n\nBy eliminating options A, C, and D, only Option B remains. We must verify that it perfectly matches all the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic, step-by-step analysis is required, paying close attention to the interpretation of the NMR data and the predicted spectra for each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The 1:1 molar ratio is critical. It means the total number of protons from each compound contributes equally to the overall spectrum's integration.\n*   **Signal Types:** The problem explicitly states all signals are \"singlets\" in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions. This is a powerful clue for eliminating structures.\n*   **Integration Ratios:** The ratios (1:1 for aromatic, 2:1:1 for aliphatic) must be converted to the actual number of protons per signal based on the total proton count in the mixture.\n*   **Symmetry:** The number of unique signals a molecule produces is directly related to its symmetry. Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like a plane or axis of rotation) are chemically equivalent and will appear as a single signal.\n*   **A Common Pitfall:** A frequent error in analyzing these isomers is misinterpreting the symmetry of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (isodurene). It possesses a plane of symmetry that makes its two aromatic protons equivalent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's translate the provided spectral data into concrete requirements for our mixture.\n\n1.  **Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (relative size 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (relative size 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (relative size 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Requirement 1:** The two compounds together must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n2.  **Aromatic Signals:** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, a 1:1 integration ratio means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n    *   **Requirement 2:** The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (2H each).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nNow, we analyze each candidate molecule to see what signals it would produce on its own.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Due to spin-spin coupling, the aliphatic region would show a quartet (for the -CH₂) and a triplet (for the -CH₃), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**. This also eliminates **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This produces **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups. This plane makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique one at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique one at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (A, C, and D) to see which one matches our requirements.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce one 2H singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the 1:1 ratio requirement. The deciding factor must be the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check (Requirement: three singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H):**\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n        *   Combined Result: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is at least four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 6H]. This gives exactly three singlets with the required integrations to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB (Isodurene) contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n        *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, there are several inconsistencies and a recurring error in predicting the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. My approach is to perform a correct, step-by-step analysis from first principles to arrive at the definitive answer.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the NMR Data:** I will first break down the information given in the problem. The key points are the 1:1 ratio of two aromatic singlets and the 2:1:1 ratio of three aliphatic singlets. For a 1:1 mixture of C10H14 isomers (24 total aliphatic protons), the 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n2.  **Predict Individual Spectra Correctly:** I will determine the expected ¹H NMR signals for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. A crucial point here is the correct analysis of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which many of the provided answers get wrong.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options Systematically:** I will test each option (A, B, C, D) by combining the predicted spectra of the two compounds in the pair. I will first eliminate any option containing a compound that doesn't fit the basic criteria (e.g., producing non-singlet signals). Then, I will check if the remaining combinations produce the correct number and ratio of aliphatic signals.\n4.  **Conclude the Answer:** The option that perfectly matches all criteria will be the correct answer. This entire logical flow will be implemented and explained within a Python script.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signal Type:** The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are *singlets*. This immediately rules out any compound with coupled protons, such as 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   **Integration Calculation:** The 2:1:1 ratio must be applied to the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture (12H + 12H = 24H), yielding signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Symmetry of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through carbons 2 and 5. This makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) chemically equivalent, producing a single 2H singlet, not two 1H singlets as some answers incorrectly assume. This also results in three distinct methyl environments: C1/C3 (6H), C2 (3H), and C5 (3H).\n*   **Aromatic Signal Count:** Since all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each, any pair of them will satisfy the \"two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. Therefore, the deciding factor must be the combination of aliphatic signals.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data to identify two compounds in a mixture by performing a\n    correct, step-by-step analysis and highlighting common pitfalls.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstruct the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\")\n    print(\"    - For a 1:1 mixture, this implies each compound gives one aromatic singlet, and both represent 2H.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\")\n    print(\"    - Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from Cpd 1) + 12H (from Cpd 2) = 24H.\")\n    print(\"    - A 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts) for 24H means integrations of (2/4)*24H=12H, (1/4)*24H=6H, and (1/4)*24H=6H.\")\n    print(\"  - Key Constraint: All aliphatic signals are singlets.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the predicted spectral characteristics for each compound based on correct symmetry analysis.\n    # A value of 'None' for aliphatic_integrations means it produces non-singlets (e.g., quartets/triplets).\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\":         {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": None}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        if data['aliphatic_integrations'] is None:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals: Produces non-singlets (quartet/triplet).

All four candidate molecules fit this formula. Each molecule has 14 protons in total. The benzene ring has 2 protons, and there are four methyl groups with 3 protons each (2 + 4*3 = 14).\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for interpreting the signal integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most direct interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   The fact that they are all singlets is a critical clue, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to correctly predict the spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce one 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We combine the predicted aliphatic signals for each pair to see which one matches the required [12H, 6H, 6H] pattern.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   **Combined Result:** The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Ruled out in Step 2.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined Result:** This would result in at least four signals (one 6H signal might overlap, but the two 3H signals are unique). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined Result:** A total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers with the following spectral features:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   A crucial clue is that all signals are **singlets**. This means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from the first C₁₀H₁₄ molecule) + 12 (from the second) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n*   **Conclusion from Data:** We are looking for a pair of compounds that, when combined, produce two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe prediction is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**. This rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Ruled out in Step 2 because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Prehnitene: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (e.g., [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H], assuming the 6H signals overlap). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Durene: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in four signals [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is necessary.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the spectral information given for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this 1:1 ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most logical conclusion is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   A crucial detail is that all signals are **singlets**.

Due to spin-spin coupling, the -CH₂- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH₃ protons as a triplet. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This also eliminates option B from the question.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

(Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = At least **four** total aliphatic signals (one 6H signal might overlap). (Does not match)\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons. Given that there are two aromatic protons on each tetramethylbenzene isomer, the most logical conclusion is that the spectrum shows two distinct 2H singlets.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Singlets Only.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting, such as ethyl groups.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (from four methyl groups). In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃).

This results in **three singlets with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Already eliminated.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This gives a total of **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly produces **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio.

The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo decide the final answer, a rigorous step-by-step analysis is required, paying close attention to the interpretation of the NMR data and the correct prediction of the spectra for each candidate molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe problem describes the spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and both signals represent the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   A crucial clue is that all signals are **singlets**. This means the protons giving rise to these signals have no chemically non-equivalent protons on adjacent atoms.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from the four methyl groups of the first compound + 12 from the second).\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound\n\nThis step requires a careful analysis of each molecule's symmetry to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Due to spin-spin coupling, the aliphatic region would show a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**. This rules out any option containing it.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and another proton's position) are in different chemical environments. They produce **two distinct singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A mixture containing Isodurene would show at least three aromatic signals (its own two 1H singlets plus the signal from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, Isodurene can be **eliminated**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, we can systematically evaluate the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Eliminated because it contains Isodurene, which would lead to three aromatic signals.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Eliminated because it contains Isodurene.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated because it contains both Isodurene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** This is the only remaining possibility. We must verify that it perfectly matches the data.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Correct Mixture\n\nLet's combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in Option D:\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n*   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   The total is **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H, the integration ratio is 1:1. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   The total is **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the ¹H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided information and applying rigorous chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the spectral information provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Mixture Ratio:** We have a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the formula C10H14. All candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 1: All Singlets.** The fact that all signals are singlets immediately rules out any compound with coupled aliphatic protons. **1,4-diethylbenzene** has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) which would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be in the mixture. This eliminates **Option A**.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2: Integration.** Each C10H14 tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with these exact integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 3: Number of Signals.** The mixture shows a total of two aromatic signals.\n    *   **Crucial Point 4: Integration.** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, the 1:1 integration ratio means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound gives one 2H singlet.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Tetramethylbenzene Isomer**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of the remaining three candidate molecules.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are equivalent. -> **One 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. -> **One 12H singlet**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are equivalent. -> **One 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). -> **Two 6H singlets**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Lower symmetry. The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons are not equivalent. -> **Two 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique). -> **Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n    *   **Crucial Point 5:** Any mixture containing Isodurene would have at least three aromatic signals (the two 1H signals from Isodurene plus at least one signal from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, Isodurene cannot be in the mixture. This eliminates **Option C** and **Option D**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Option**\n\nBy eliminating options A, C, and D, we are left with only Option B. We must verify that it perfectly matches all the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   **Result:** The 1:1 mixture shows **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H, the integration ratio is 1:1. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n        *   **Result:** The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and correcting any inconsistencies.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula & Mixture Ratio:** We have a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All candidate molecules fit this formula. The 1:1 ratio is crucial for interpreting the signal integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\". In a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons. The most logical conclusion is that each compound produces one singlet corresponding to 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 1: Singlets Only.** The fact that all signals are singlets immediately rules out any compound with coupled aliphatic protons, such as ethyl groups which would produce quartets and triplets.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2: Integration.** The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from the four methyl groups of the first compound) + 12 (from the second) = 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**. (Note: Several candidate answers incorrectly state this compound gives two 1H singlets; this is a common error).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options (B, C, D)**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of [12H, 6H, 6H].\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:**\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene gives: one 12H singlet.\n        *   Isodurene gives: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene gives: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   Prehnitene gives: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 6H]. This gives a total of **three singlets** with the exact integrations required to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Prehnitene gives: two 6H singlets.\n        *   Isodurene gives: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined Result: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This would result in at least four signals (even if one 6H signal from each compound overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided solutions and correcting any errors.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 1: All Singlets.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a powerful filter. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2: Integration.** The mixture is 1:1. The isomers are C₁₀H₁₄, which means they are tetramethylbenzenes, each having 4 methyl groups (12 aliphatic protons). The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12H + 12H = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aliphatic Region:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 3: Number and Integration of Signals.** The mixture contains only two types of aromatic protons. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most direct interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one 2H singlet.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As established in Step 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This also eliminates **Option B**, which contains it.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry than the others. The two aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is between two methyl groups (at C3 and C5), while the proton at C6 is adjacent to two different methyl groups (at C1 and C2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Isodurene produces **two distinct 1H singlets** in the aromatic region. A mixture containing Isodurene would therefore show at least three aromatic signals (its own two 1H signals plus the signal(s) from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, Isodurene can be **eliminated** as a possible component of the mixture. This rules out **Option C** and **Option D**.\n\n3.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Status:** A valid candidate.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Status:** A valid candidate.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Option**\n\nBy eliminating options B, C, and D, only Option A remains. We must verify that this pair perfectly matches all the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information given for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 1: All Singlets.** The fact that all signals are singlets immediately rules out any compound with coupled aliphatic protons, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from consideration.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2: Integration.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 3: Two Signals.** The mixture produces only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Crucial Point 4: 1:1 Ratio.** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most direct interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (i.e., 2H each).\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe prediction is based on molecular symmetry, which determines the chemical equivalence of protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent.

They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl on the symmetry axis at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl on the symmetry axis at C5 (one 3H singlet). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** FAILED. Contains the eliminated 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four** total aliphatic signals.\n    *   FAILED. Does not match the \"three aliphatic signals\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) = **Two 2H singlets**.

Does not match the \"three aliphatic signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is required. We will first interpret the spectral data, then predict the spectrum for each individual candidate molecule, and finally evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds. This is critical for calculating the proton integrations.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlets only\" information is a crucial clue. The compound **1,4-diethylbenzene** contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin coupling. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated, which rules out **Option D**.\n    *   Each C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total aliphatic proton count is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the 1:1 signal ratio implies that each signal corresponds to the same number of protons. The most logical interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture produces one aromatic singlet, and each singlet integrates to 2H.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each isomer is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are equivalent.

This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly shows **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. **This is a match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two 6H singlets**.

This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was eliminated in Step 1.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct answer, a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is required. We will first interpret the spectral data, then predict the spectrum for each individual compound, and finally evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Careful Points and Analysis**\n\n1.  **Interpreting the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula & Mixture:** The problem specifies a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. This means the total proton count from each compound contributes equally to the spectrum's integration.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The data shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\" The keyword \"singlets\" is critical. It immediately rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would exhibit spin-spin coupling, such as ethyl groups. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each compound's four methyl groups). A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The data shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio.\" In a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each of the two compounds produces one distinct aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n\n2.  **Predicting the Spectra of Individual Compounds:** This requires a careful analysis of each molecule's symmetry.\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). These would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not singlets. Therefore, **this compound is immediately eliminated**.\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: All four methyl groups are equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Evaluating the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test each option from the prompt against the required spectral data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four aliphatic signals**. This does not match the required three signals.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is **eliminated** because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four or five aliphatic signals** (depending on overlap). This does not match the required three signals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we will perform a rigorous step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data and compare it against the predicted spectra for each possible mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, a 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most logical conclusion is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It immediately rules out any structures with alkyl groups that would exhibit spin-spin coupling, such as ethyl groups.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from the four methyl groups of the first compound + 12 from the second). A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 total integration parts. We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each isomer is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has lower symmetry than the other isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at position 4 (between two methyl groups) and position 6 (next to one methyl group) are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because they are not equivalent, they produce **two distinct singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe will now test each option against the required spectral data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is **eliminated** because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture contains 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which itself produces *two* 1H aromatic singlets. The other compound, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, produces *one* 2H aromatic singlet. The total spectrum would therefore show **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data, which specifies only two aromatic signals. This option is **eliminated**.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Similar to option B, this mixture contains 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It would also produce **three aromatic signals** (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene). This contradicts the data. This option is **eliminated**.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will produce **two singlets**, and since each represents 2H, the integration ratio is 1:1. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

All candidate molecules fit this formula. The 1:1 ratio is crucial for interpreting the integrations.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   The fact that all signals are **singlets** is a powerful clue. It immediately rules out any compound with coupled aliphatic protons, such as the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (4 x CH₃). In a 1:1 mixture, the total aliphatic proton count is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. This strongly suggests that the mixture contains two compounds that each produce one aromatic signal representing the same number of protons (e.g., two 2H singlets).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThis is the most critical step and requires a careful analysis of molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** Contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) which produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated** because the data specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region. This rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This molecule has low symmetry. The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups (C3-Me and C5-Me), while H6 is between a methyl group (C1-Me) and another methyl group (C5-Me), but the overall substitution pattern is not symmetric with respect to them. Therefore, this compound produces **two distinct 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any mixture containing Isodurene would show at least three aromatic signals (the two 1H signals from Isodurene plus at least one from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only **two** aromatic signals. Therefore, Isodurene can be **eliminated**. This rules out **Option C** and **Option D**.\n\n3.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent.

Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**.

It means the total number of protons from each compound contributes equally to the overall spectrum's integration.\n*   **Signal Types:** The problem explicitly states all signals are \"singlets\" in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions. This is a powerful clue for eliminating structures.\n*   **Integration Ratios:** The ratios (1:1 for aromatic, 2:1:1 for aliphatic) must be converted to the actual number of protons per signal based on the total proton count in the mixture.\n*   **Symmetry:** The number of unique signals a molecule produces is directly related to its symmetry. Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like a plane or axis of rotation) are chemically equivalent and will appear as a single signal.\n*   **A Common Pitfall:** A frequent error in analyzing these isomers is misinterpreting the symmetry of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (isodurene). It possesses a plane of symmetry that makes its two aromatic protons equivalent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's translate the provided spectral data into concrete requirements for our mixture.\n\n1.  **Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (relative size 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (relative size 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (relative size 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Requirement 1:** The two compounds together must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n2.  **Aromatic Signals:** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, a 1:1 integration ratio means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second.\n    *   **Requirement 2:** The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (2H each).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nNow, we analyze each candidate molecule to see what signals it would produce on its own.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Due to spin-spin coupling, the aliphatic region would show a quartet (for the -CH₂) and a triplet (for the -CH₃), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**. This also eliminates **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This produces **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups. This plane makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique one at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique one at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (A, C, and D) to see which one matches our requirements.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce one 2H singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the 1:1 ratio requirement. The deciding factor must be the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check (Requirement: three singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H):**\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n        *   Combined Result: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is at least four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 6H]. This gives exactly three singlets with the required integrations to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB (Isodurene) contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n        *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, there are several inconsistencies and a recurring error in predicting the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. My approach is to perform a correct, step-by-step analysis from first principles to arrive at the definitive answer.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the NMR Data:** I will first break down the information given in the problem. The key points are the 1:1 ratio of two aromatic singlets and the 2:1:1 ratio of three aliphatic singlets. For a 1:1 mixture of C10H14 isomers (24 total aliphatic protons), the 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n2.  **Predict Individual Spectra Correctly:** I will determine the expected ¹H NMR signals for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. A crucial point here is the correct analysis of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which many of the provided answers get wrong.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options Systematically:** I will test each option (A, B, C, D) by combining the predicted spectra of the two compounds in the pair. I will first eliminate any option containing a compound that doesn't fit the basic criteria (e.g., producing non-singlet signals). Then, I will check if the remaining combinations produce the correct number and ratio of aliphatic signals.\n4.  **Conclude the Answer:** The option that perfectly matches all criteria will be the correct answer. This entire logical flow will be implemented and explained within a Python script.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signal Type:** The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are *singlets*. This immediately rules out any compound with coupled protons, such as 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   **Integration Calculation:** The 2:1:1 ratio must be applied to the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture (12H + 12H = 24H), yielding signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Symmetry of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through carbons 2 and 5. This makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) chemically equivalent, producing a single 2H singlet, not two 1H singlets as some answers incorrectly assume. This also results in three distinct methyl environments: C1/C3 (6H), C2 (3H), and C5 (3H).\n*   **Aromatic Signal Count:** Since all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each, any pair of them will satisfy the \"two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. Therefore, the deciding factor must be the combination of aliphatic signals.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data to identify two compounds in a mixture by performing a\n    correct, step-by-step analysis and highlighting common pitfalls.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstruct the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\")\n    print(\"    - For a 1:1 mixture, this implies each compound gives one aromatic singlet, and both represent 2H.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\")\n    print(\"    - Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from Cpd 1) + 12H (from Cpd 2) = 24H.\")\n    print(\"    - A 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts) for 24H means integrations of (2/4)*24H=12H, (1/4)*24H=6H, and (1/4)*24H=6H.\")\n    print(\"  - Key Constraint: All aliphatic signals are singlets.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the predicted spectral characteristics for each compound based on correct symmetry analysis.\n    # A value of 'None' for aliphatic_integrations means it produces non-singlets (e.g., quartets/triplets).\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\":         {\"aromatic_signals\": 1, \"aliphatic_integrations\": None}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        if data['aliphatic_integrations'] is None:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals: Produces non-singlets (quartet/triplet).

All four candidate molecules fit this formula. Each molecule has 14 protons in total. The benzene ring has 2 protons, and there are four methyl groups with 3 protons each (2 + 4*3 = 14).\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for interpreting the signal integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most direct interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   The fact that they are all singlets is a critical clue, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to correctly predict the spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce one 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We combine the predicted aliphatic signals for each pair to see which one matches the required [12H, 6H, 6H] pattern.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   **Combined Result:** The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Ruled out in Step 2.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined Result:** This would result in at least four signals (one 6H signal might overlap, but the two 3H signals are unique). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined Result:** A total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers with the following spectral features:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   A crucial clue is that all signals are **singlets**. This means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from the first C₁₀H₁₄ molecule) + 12 (from the second) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n*   **Conclusion from Data:** We are looking for a pair of compounds that, when combined, produce two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe prediction is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**. This rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Ruled out in Step 2 because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Prehnitene: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (e.g., [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H], assuming the 6H signals overlap). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Durene: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in four signals [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is necessary.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the spectral information given for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this 1:1 ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most logical conclusion is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   A crucial detail is that all signals are **singlets**. This immediately allows for the elimination of any compound that would exhibit spin-spin splitting in its aliphatic signals.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from the four methyl groups of the first compound + 12 from the second).\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons corresponding to each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n*   **Summary of Requirements:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce a spectrum with two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Due to spin-spin coupling, the -CH₂- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH₃ protons as a triplet. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This also eliminates option B from the question.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at positions 4 and 6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique methyl group at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique methyl group at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must now check which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four** total aliphatic signals. (Does not match)\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated in Step 2.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) = **Two 2H singlets**. The integration ratio is 1:1. **(Perfect Match)**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) = **Three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to 2:1:1. **(Perfect Match)**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = At least **four** total aliphatic signals (one 6H signal might overlap). (Does not match)\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons. Given that there are two aromatic protons on each tetramethylbenzene isomer, the most logical conclusion is that the spectrum shows two distinct 2H singlets.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Singlets Only.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting, such as ethyl groups.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (from four methyl groups). In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**. This also eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Already eliminated.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This gives a total of **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly produces **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo decide the final answer, a rigorous step-by-step analysis is required, paying close attention to the interpretation of the NMR data and the correct prediction of the spectra for each candidate molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe problem describes the spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and both signals represent the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   A crucial clue is that all signals are **singlets**. This means the protons giving rise to these signals have no chemically non-equivalent protons on adjacent atoms.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from the four methyl groups of the first compound + 12 from the second).\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound\n\nThis step requires a careful analysis of each molecule's symmetry to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Due to spin-spin coupling, the aliphatic region would show a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**. This rules out any option containing it.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and another proton's position) are in different chemical environments. They produce **two distinct singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A mixture containing Isodurene would show at least three aromatic signals (its own two 1H singlets plus the signal from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, Isodurene can be **eliminated**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, we can systematically evaluate the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Eliminated because it contains Isodurene, which would lead to three aromatic signals.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Eliminated because it contains Isodurene.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated because it contains both Isodurene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** This is the only remaining possibility. We must verify that it perfectly matches the data.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Correct Mixture\n\nLet's combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in Option D:\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n*   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   The total is **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H, the integration ratio is 1:1. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   The total is **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the ¹H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided information and applying rigorous chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the spectral information provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Mixture Ratio:** We have a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the formula C10H14. All candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 1: All Singlets.** The fact that all signals are singlets immediately rules out any compound with coupled aliphatic protons. **1,4-diethylbenzene** has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) which would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be in the mixture. This eliminates **Option A**.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2: Integration.** Each C10H14 tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with these exact integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 3: Number of Signals.** The mixture shows a total of two aromatic signals.\n    *   **Crucial Point 4: Integration.** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, the 1:1 integration ratio means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound gives one 2H singlet.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Tetramethylbenzene Isomer**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of the remaining three candidate molecules.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are equivalent. -> **One 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. -> **One 12H singlet**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are equivalent. -> **One 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). -> **Two 6H singlets**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Lower symmetry. The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons are not equivalent. -> **Two 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique). -> **Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n    *   **Crucial Point 5:** Any mixture containing Isodurene would have at least three aromatic signals (the two 1H signals from Isodurene plus at least one signal from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, Isodurene cannot be in the mixture. This eliminates **Option C** and **Option D**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Option**\n\nBy eliminating options A, C, and D, we are left with only Option B. We must verify that it perfectly matches all the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   **Result:** The 1:1 mixture shows **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H, the integration ratio is 1:1. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n        *   **Result:** The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and correcting any inconsistencies.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula & Mixture Ratio:** We have a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All candidate molecules fit this formula. The 1:1 ratio is crucial for interpreting the signal integrations.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\". In a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons. The most logical conclusion is that each compound produces one singlet corresponding to 2 protons (2H).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 1: Singlets Only.** The fact that all signals are singlets immediately rules out any compound with coupled aliphatic protons, such as ethyl groups which would produce quartets and triplets.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2: Integration.** The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from the four methyl groups of the first compound) + 12 (from the second) = 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**. (Note: Several candidate answers incorrectly state this compound gives two 1H singlets; this is a common error).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options (B, C, D)**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of [12H, 6H, 6H].\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:**\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene gives: one 12H singlet.\n        *   Isodurene gives: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Durene gives: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   Prehnitene gives: **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 6H]. This gives a total of **three singlets** with the exact integrations required to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Prehnitene gives: two 6H singlets.\n        *   Isodurene gives: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined Result: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This would result in at least four signals (even if one 6H signal from each compound overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the most accurate points from the provided solutions and correcting any errors.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the information provided from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 1: All Singlets.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a powerful filter. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2: Integration.** The mixture is 1:1. The isomers are C₁₀H₁₄, which means they are tetramethylbenzenes, each having 4 methyl groups (12 aliphatic protons). The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12H + 12H = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aliphatic Region:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 3: Number and Integration of Signals.** The mixture contains only two types of aromatic protons. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most direct interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one 2H singlet.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As established in Step 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This also eliminates **Option B**, which contains it.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry than the others. The two aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is between two methyl groups (at C3 and C5), while the proton at C6 is adjacent to two different methyl groups (at C1 and C2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Isodurene produces **two distinct 1H singlets** in the aromatic region. A mixture containing Isodurene would therefore show at least three aromatic signals (its own two 1H signals plus the signal(s) from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, Isodurene can be **eliminated** as a possible component of the mixture. This rules out **Option C** and **Option D**.\n\n3.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Status:** A valid candidate.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Status:** A valid candidate.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Option**\n\nBy eliminating options B, C, and D, only Option A remains. We must verify that this pair perfectly matches all the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information given for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 1: All Singlets.** The fact that all signals are singlets immediately rules out any compound with coupled aliphatic protons, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from consideration.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2: Integration.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Crucial Point 3: Two Signals.** The mixture produces only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Crucial Point 4: 1:1 Ratio.** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most direct interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (i.e., 2H each).\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe prediction is based on molecular symmetry, which determines the chemical equivalence of protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at positions 4 and 6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl on the symmetry axis at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl on the symmetry axis at C5 (one 3H singlet). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** FAILED. Contains the eliminated 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four** total aliphatic signals.\n    *   FAILED. Does not match the \"three aliphatic signals\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) = **Two 2H singlets**. This gives the required two signals in a 1:1 ratio. **(MATCH)**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) = **Three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This gives the required 2:1:1 ratio. **(MATCH)**\n    *   This pair perfectly matches all experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = At least four total aliphatic signals (five if the 6H signals don't overlap).\n    *   FAILED. Does not match the \"three aliphatic signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is required. We will first interpret the spectral data, then predict the spectrum for each individual candidate molecule, and finally evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds. This is critical for calculating the proton integrations.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The \"singlets only\" information is a crucial clue. The compound **1,4-diethylbenzene** contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin coupling. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated, which rules out **Option D**.\n    *   Each C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total aliphatic proton count is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the 1:1 signal ratio implies that each signal corresponds to the same number of protons. The most logical interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture produces one aromatic singlet, and each singlet integrates to 2H.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each isomer is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This produces **one 12H singlet**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2, C3). This produces **two 6H singlets**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the two protons (at C4, C6) chemically equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair (at C1, C3), the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly shows **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. **This is a match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (e.g., 6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).

This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was eliminated in Step 1.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct answer, a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is required. We will first interpret the spectral data, then predict the spectrum for each individual compound, and finally evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Careful Points and Analysis**\n\n1.  **Interpreting the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula & Mixture:** The problem specifies a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. This means the total proton count from each compound contributes equally to the spectrum's integration.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The data shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\" The keyword \"singlets\" is critical. It immediately rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would exhibit spin-spin coupling, such as ethyl groups. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each compound's four methyl groups). A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The data shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio.\" In a 1:1 mixture, this strongly implies that each of the two compounds produces one distinct aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n\n2.  **Predicting the Spectra of Individual Compounds:** This requires a careful analysis of each molecule's symmetry.\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). These would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not singlets. Therefore, **this compound is immediately eliminated**.\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetric.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: All four methyl groups are equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Evaluating the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test each option from the prompt against the required spectral data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four aliphatic signals**. This does not match the required three signals.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is **eliminated** because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (one 2H singlet) = Two 2H singlets. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four or five aliphatic signals** (depending on overlap). This does not match the required three signals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we will perform a rigorous step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data and compare it against the predicted spectra for each possible mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, a 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most logical conclusion is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It immediately rules out any structures with alkyl groups that would exhibit spin-spin coupling, such as ethyl groups.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from the four methyl groups of the first compound + 12 from the second). A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 total integration parts. We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each isomer is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The aliphatic protons would show spin-spin splitting, resulting in a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is immediately **eliminated**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has lower symmetry than the other isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at position 4 (between two methyl groups) and position 6 (next to one methyl group) are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because they are not equivalent, they produce **two distinct singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe will now test each option against the required spectral data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is **eliminated** because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture contains 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which itself produces *two* 1H aromatic singlets. The other compound, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, produces *one* 2H aromatic singlet. The total spectrum would therefore show **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data, which specifies only two aromatic signals. This option is **eliminated**.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Similar to option B, this mixture contains 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It would also produce **three aromatic signals** (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene). This contradicts the data. This option is **eliminated**.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will produce **two singlets**, and since each represents 2H, the integration ratio is 1:1. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
