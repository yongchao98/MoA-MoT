It requires the application of two core principles:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time by `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`. The particles travel the detector radius `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Establish a Proportionality to Solve:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`. This can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios.\n\n4.  **Set Up and Solve the Ratio:**\n    *   We can equate the expressions for the two scenarios: `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n    *   We are given: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`, and `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    *   Substituting the values: `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n    *   Solving for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values for natural logarithms, `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Match the Result to the Options:**\n    *   The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n    *   Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n        A) 28\n        B) 54\n        C) 68\n        D) 40\n    *   The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** The core of the problem is applying the decay law in the particle's proper reference frame and using time dilation to connect it to the lab frame. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c` is justified by the problem statement and is crucial for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The detector radius `R = 30m` is not needed to solve the problem. The ratiometric approach cancels out this constant, along with the speed of light `c` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which in turn requires a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** There is a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the physical derivation, the final formula, and the calculated numerical result of ~54.2. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their respective prompts and do not reflect an error in the calculation itself. This high level of agreement on the numerical result provides strong confidence in the answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and the fundamental physics principles involved, the following step-by-step derivation and careful points lead to the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physics:** The problem combines two core concepts of modern physics: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by the exponential decay law, which is fundamentally based on the time elapsed in the particle's own reference frame (proper time, `t_p`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    Here, `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The time measured in the laboratory's frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time the particle experiences during its flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Time of Flight:** The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies approximating their velocity `v` as the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is therefore:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** By substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_p` into the survival equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n6.  **Use a Ratiometric Solution:** The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for this constant `K` by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which rearranges to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor:** Since `K` is constant, we can equate the expressions from the two scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`), the expression simplifies:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Solving for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n9.  **Match to Options:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 28\n    B) 54\n    C) 40\n    D) 68\n    The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** It is crucial to apply the decay law in the particle's proper reference frame and use time dilation to connect it to the lab frame. All candidate answers correctly identified this as the core of the problem.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's velocity is approximately the speed of light (`v ≈ c`) is justified by the problem statement and is necessary to calculate the time of flight without more information.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The detector radius `R = 30` meters is not needed to solve the problem. The ratiometric approach, which all candidate answers correctly used, cancels out this term along with the particle's unknown proper lifetime `τ`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Unanimous Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers, despite having different option lists, unanimously derived the correct formula and calculated the numerical result to be approximately 54.2. This high degree of consensus confirms the validity of the calculation.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers stem from variations in how the options were listed for them. The key is that the numerical calculation is universally agreed upon. The calculated value of ~54.19 must be mapped to the specific option list provided in the question, where it corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the provided candidate answers to find a consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical formula. Then, I will use this consensus formula to perform the calculation myself. The core of the problem lies in combining the principles of exponential decay and special relativity's time dilation. The fraction of surviving particles `f` is related to the Lorentz factor `γ` by the equation `f = exp(-K/γ)`, where `K` is a constant. By setting up a ratio between the two scenarios, we can solve for the unknown Lorentz factor without needing to know the particle's lifetime or the detector's radius. Finally, I will write a Python script to compute the numerical value and compare it against the provided options to determine the correct choice.\n\nHere are the careful points I will consider:\n1.  **Correct Physical Model**: All candidate answers correctly identify that the solution requires combining exponential decay with time dilation. The decay must be calculated in the particle's own reference frame (proper time).\n2.  **Ratiometric Solution**: The most elegant solution, used by all candidates, is to recognize that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant. This allows for setting up a ratio ` -γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂) ` which eliminates the need for unknown variables.\n3.  **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies the approximation of their speed `v ≈ c`. This is crucial for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation.\n4.  **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (2/3 vs 1/3), their decay must be slowed down more from the lab's perspective. This requires a larger time dilation effect, meaning the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` must be greater than the original `γ₁ = 20`.\n5.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: There is a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the physical derivation, the final formula, and the calculated numerical result of approximately 54.2. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their respective prompts and do not reflect an error in the calculation itself.

Its solution requires combining two core concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay**: The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` (the time elapsed in the particle's own reference frame) is given by the formula `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation)**: A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time by `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The particles travel the detector radius, `R`, at \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" which justifies approximating their speed `v` as the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Method to Solve**:\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we can rearrange the formula: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios. Therefore, we can set up a ratio:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate**:\n    *   We are given the initial conditions (Scenario 1): `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   We are given the target condition (Scenario 2): `f₂ = 2/3`, and we need to find `γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging these into the ratio equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n    *   Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Match the Result to the Options**:\n    *   The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options: A) 68, B) 40, C) 28, D) 54.\n    *   The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified that the solution requires combining the exponential decay law (in the particle's proper frame) with the principle of time dilation from special relativity. This unanimous agreement on the physical model provides high confidence.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The problem's statement of \"ultra-relativistic velocities\" is a key piece of information that justifies the approximation `v ≈ c`. This simplifies the time-of-flight calculation and is essential for the solution.\n*   **Ratiometric Solution**: The most elegant aspect of the solution, identified by all candidates, is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant. This allows for a ratiometric comparison between the two scenarios, which cleverly eliminates the need to know the particle's proper lifetime `τ` or even use the given detector radius of 30 meters.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive their journey (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must tick slower relative to the lab. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which in turn demands a higher Lorentz factor. The calculated result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, confirming that the answer is physically consistent.\n*   **Unanimity of Calculation**: Every single one of the 15 candidate answers, despite variations in their final letter choice, correctly derived the same formula and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 54.2.

Therefore, the proper time the particle experiences during its flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Time of Flight:** The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies approximating their velocity `v` as the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is therefore:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** By substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_p` into the survival equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n6.  **Use a Ratiometric Solution:** The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for this constant `K` by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which rearranges to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor:** Since `K` is constant, we can equate the expressions from the two scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`), the expression simplifies:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Solving for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n9.  **Match to Options:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

The ratiometric approach, which all candidate answers correctly used, cancels out this term along with the particle's unknown proper lifetime `τ`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Unanimous Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers, despite having different option lists, unanimously derived the correct formula and calculated the numerical result to be approximately 54.2. This high degree of consensus confirms the validity of the calculation.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers stem from variations in how the options were listed for them. The key is that the numerical calculation is universally agreed upon. The calculated value of ~54.19 must be mapped to the specific option list provided in the question, where it corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the provided candidate answers to find a consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical formula. Then, I will use this consensus formula to perform the calculation myself. The core of the problem lies in combining the principles of exponential decay and special relativity's time dilation. The fraction of surviving particles `f` is related to the Lorentz factor `γ` by the equation `f = exp(-K/γ)`, where `K` is a constant. By setting up a ratio between the two scenarios, we can solve for the unknown Lorentz factor without needing to know the particle's lifetime or the detector's radius. Finally, I will write a Python script to compute the numerical value and compare it against the provided options to determine the correct choice.\n\nHere are the careful points I will consider:\n1.  **Correct Physical Model**: All candidate answers correctly identify that the solution requires combining exponential decay with time dilation. The decay must be calculated in the particle's own reference frame (proper time).\n2.  **Ratiometric Solution**: The most elegant solution, used by all candidates, is to recognize that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant. This allows for setting up a ratio ` -γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂) ` which eliminates the need for unknown variables.\n3.  **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which justifies the approximation of their speed `v ≈ c`. This is crucial for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation.\n4.  **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (2/3 vs 1/3), their decay must be slowed down more from the lab's perspective.

This requires combining two fundamental concepts:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by the formula `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower relative to a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`. The particles travel the detector radius `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   By substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula, we get the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Approach to Solve:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can solve for this constant term by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which rearranges to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, we can set the expressions from the two scenarios equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n    *   Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Match to Options:** The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

All candidate answers correctly identified this model.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's velocity `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and is essential for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation. This makes the given radius of 30m unnecessary for the final calculation.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The key to solving the problem efficiently is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant across both scenarios. This allows for a ratiometric solution that eliminates the need to know the particle's proper lifetime `τ`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their decay must be \"slowed down\" more from the lab's perspective. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the original `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers, despite some confusion with the final letter choice due to different option ordering, correctly derived the same formula and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 54.2.

This can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios. We can therefore set up an equation relating the two scenarios:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Solve:**\n    *   We are given the initial conditions (Scenario 1): `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   We are given the target condition (Scenario 2): `f₂ = 2/3`, and we need to find `γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging these into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes:\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   The Python code executed in the previous step calculated this value precisely:\n        `gamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)`\n    *   The output confirmed that `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`.\n\n6.  **Match to Options:**\n    *   The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is `54.19`.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        A) 68\n        B) 28\n        C) 54\n        D) 40\n    *   The calculated value of 54.19 is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** There is unanimous agreement across all candidate answers that the correct approach is to combine the exponential decay law (in the particle's proper time frame) with the principle of time dilation.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The problem states \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" which justifies the approximation `v ≈ c`. This is a crucial step that simplifies the time-of-flight calculation.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The detector radius `R = 30m` is not needed to solve the problem. The ratiometric approach, correctly identified by all agents, cancels out the constant term `R / (c * τ)`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must tick slower relative to the lab.

The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time by `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:\n    *   First, we determine the time of flight in the lab frame, `t_lab`. The particles travel the detector radius, `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during its flight using the time dilation formula: `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the exponential decay formula gives the survival fraction `f` as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Approach to Solve**:\n    *   The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`. This can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n    *   Since `K` is constant, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios. Therefore, we can set up a ratio:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate**:\n    *   We are given the initial conditions (Scenario 1): `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    *   We are given the target condition (Scenario 2): `f₂ = 2/3`, and we need to find `γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging these into the ratio equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs on both sides cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n    *   Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Match the Result to the Options**:\n    *   The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately **54.2**.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        A) 68\n        B) 40\n        C) 28\n        D) 54\n    *   The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model**: It is essential to use the decay law in terms of the particle's proper time and to correctly apply the time dilation formula to relate it to the lab frame. All candidate answers correctly identified this model.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation**: The approximation `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and is crucial for simplifying the time-of-flight calculation. This makes the given radius of 30 meters extraneous information, as it is part of a constant that cancels out.\n*   **Identifying Constants**: The key to solving the problem efficiently is recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant across both scenarios. This allows for a ratiometric solution that eliminates the need to know the particle's proper lifetime `τ` or the detector radius `R`.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must tick slower relative to the lab. This requires a greater time dilation effect, which in turn requires a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: There is a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the physical derivation, the final formula, and the calculated numerical result of ~54.2. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their respective prompts and do not reflect an error in the calculation itself.
