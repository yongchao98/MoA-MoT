Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O). This point is correctly identified by all candidate answers that perform the calculation.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong intensity bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out any structure with a secondary or tertiary amine or an amide that doesn't have a -NH₂ group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (typically <1700 cm⁻¹) and fits perfectly for an ester attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The different chemical shifts indicate the two substituents have different electronic effects (one donating, one withdrawing).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nThe combined spectral data points to a single, unambiguous structure composed of:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these fragments yields **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate ester (-OCOCH₂CH₃). The methylene quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester with the correct NMR shift, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide (inconsistent IR) and is 1,3-disubstituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (inconsistent IR N-H stretch).\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe detailed analysis of all spectral data overwhelmingly supports **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** as the correct structure. While the majority of the candidate answers perform a correct chemical analysis, many of them incorrectly map their conclusion to the final lettered option. The correct structure, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. The frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, causing an upfield shift to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, causing a downfield shift to 8.0 ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This rules out option A, 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, confirming the IR data.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nThe spectral data provides conclusive evidence for the following structural features:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure perfectly aligns with all the provided data, including the electronic effects observed in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's match this conclusion with the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect NMR for the alkyl chain.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct.** All data points match this structure.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect. This is a 1,3-disubstituted amide, which contradicts the NMR and IR data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data for a primary amine.\n\nThe analysis of the provided data and the evaluation of the candidate answers unanimously and unambiguously identify the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This evidence rules out option D, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide (like options A and D), which usually appears below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This rules out option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta) and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the definitive signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, confirming the IR data.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nThe combined evidence points to a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options provided:\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data (IR, NMR) and the molecular formula.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data.\n\nThe analysis of all spectral data unambiguously identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester** that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide (which typically appears below 1700 cm⁻¹) and fits perfectly for an aryl ester.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the unmistakable signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The different chemical shifts indicate that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, causing them to appear upfield at 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This triplet-quartet combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is very important. This highly downfield shift for a -CH₂- group indicates it is directly attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were part of a propionate (e.g., -CO-CH₂CH₃), the quartet would appear at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of exchangeable protons. Combined with the IR data, this signal confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Summary of Fragments:**\n    1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Assembled Structure:** Placing these fragments together leads to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The electron-donating -NH₂ group and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group are para to each other, which explains the NMR aromatic pattern.\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shows an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃), not a carbonyl.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data: the formula, the primary amine, the ethyl ester, the 1,4-disubstitution, and the electronic effects on the aromatic protons.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data for a primary amine.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide (wrong IR C=O frequency) and is 1,3-disubstituted (wrong NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nThe evidence from all spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is the characteristic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately makes options with secondary amines (C) or amides (D) less likely, as their patterns would differ.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is typical for an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a simple amide.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield (deshielded) because they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The protons at 7.0 ppm are further upfield (shielded) because they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. This perfectly matches all the fragments identified from the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate ester (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The methylene (-CH₂-) protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), not 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. This is inconsistent with the IR data.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) compound. The aromatic region of the NMR would show a more complex splitting pattern, not two clean doublets. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only structure that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (IR, ¹H NMR, and molecular formula) is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided data.\n\n**1.

Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

This evidence immediately makes option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide** (a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band) highly unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**.

The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at a very downfield 4.5 ppm. This indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nThe combined spectral data points to a molecule with the following fragments:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group where the ethyl is attached to the oxygen (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this evidence:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is Ar-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The ethyl group is part of a propionate. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (inconsistent IR and NMR amine signals).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is Ar-COOCH₂CH₃. It has a primary amine, a 1,4-disubstituted ring, and an ethyl ester group. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, which is most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide, which typically absorbs below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **3.

The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are different electronically; one is electron-donating (the amine), and one is electron-withdrawing (the ester). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded) because they are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded) because they are adjacent to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **4.

The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex, and the IR C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate (-OCOCH₂CH₃). The methylene quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a para-disubstituted ring with the correct electronic environment.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data showing two N-H stretches for a primary amine.\n\nTherefore, the data unambiguously identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1.

The para-substitution explains the two doublets in the NMR, and the electronic nature of the amine and ester groups explains their respective chemical shifts. The ethyl ester and primary amine groups are confirmed by all data points.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (-OCOCH₂CH₃). The methylene protons (-CH₂-) adjacent to the carbonyl would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets. It is also an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR carbonyl frequency.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, contradicting the data.\n\nThe evidence from all spectroscopic methods converges to uniquely identify the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three π-bonds) plus one additional π-bond. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra unsaturation is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong intensity bands is a classic signature.\n*   **Careful Point:** Two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This single piece of evidence makes options with secondary amines or amides, such as B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, highly unlikely as they would typically show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region.\n*   **Careful Point:** A carbonyl frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in options B and D), which usually absorbs at a lower frequency (< 1700 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is definitive.\n*   **Careful Point:** This symmetrical pattern indicates a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This immediately rules out option D) 3-ethoxybenzamide, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta) and would produce a more complex splitting pattern. The difference in chemical shifts (7.0 vs 8.0 ppm) shows the two substituents have opposing electronic effects (one donating, one withdrawing).\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination indicates an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a critical clue. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This observation decisively rules out option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the ethyl group is part of a propionate (Ar-O-CO-CH₂CH₃) and the methylene quartet would appear at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.2-2.6 ppm).\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion by Assembling the Pieces**\nThe spectral data provides conclusive evidence for the following structural features:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  An ethyl ester group where the ethyl is attached to the oxygen (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure perfectly aligns with all the provided data, including the electronic effects on the aromatic protons (the electron-donating amine shields the adjacent protons to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester deshields the adjacent protons to 8.0 ppm).\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure matches all spectral data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR chemical shift for the methylene group does not match.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a 1,3-disubstituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O). This point is correctly identified by all candidate answers that perform the calculation.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong intensity bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out any structure with a secondary or tertiary amine or an amide that doesn't have a -NH₂ group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (typically <1700 cm⁻¹) and fits perfectly for an ester attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The different chemical shifts indicate the two substituents have different electronic effects (one donating, one withdrawing).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nThe combined spectral data points to a single, unambiguous structure composed of:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these fragments yields **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate ester (-OCOCH₂CH₃). The methylene quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester with the correct NMR shift, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide (inconsistent IR) and is 1,3-disubstituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (inconsistent IR N-H stretch).\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe detailed analysis of all spectral data overwhelmingly supports **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** as the correct structure. While the majority of the candidate answers perform a correct chemical analysis, many of them incorrectly map their conclusion to the final lettered option. The correct structure, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. The frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, causing an upfield shift to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, causing a downfield shift to 8.0 ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This rules out option A, 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, confirming the IR data.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nThe spectral data provides conclusive evidence for the following structural features:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This evidence rules out option D, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide (like options A and D), which usually appears below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This rules out option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta) and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the definitive signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, confirming the IR data.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nThe combined evidence points to a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options provided:\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data (IR, NMR) and the molecular formula.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data.\n\nThe analysis of all spectral data unambiguously identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester** that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide (which typically appears below 1700 cm⁻¹) and fits perfectly for an aryl ester.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the unmistakable signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The different chemical shifts indicate that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, causing them to appear upfield at 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This triplet-quartet combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is very important. This highly downfield shift for a -CH₂- group indicates it is directly attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were part of a propionate (e.g., -CO-CH₂CH₃), the quartet would appear at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of exchangeable protons.

An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Assembled Structure:** Placing these fragments together leads to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The electron-donating -NH₂ group and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group are para to each other, which explains the NMR aromatic pattern.\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shows an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃), not a carbonyl.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data: the formula, the primary amine, the ethyl ester, the 1,4-disubstitution, and the electronic effects on the aromatic protons.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data for a primary amine.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect.

Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is the characteristic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately makes options with secondary amines (C) or amides (D) less likely, as their patterns would differ.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is typical for an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a simple amide.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield (deshielded) because they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The protons at 7.0 ppm are further upfield (shielded) because they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. This perfectly matches all the fragments identified from the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate ester (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The methylene (-CH₂-) protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), not 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. This is inconsistent with the IR data.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) compound. The aromatic region of the NMR would show a more complex splitting pattern, not two clean doublets.

Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option D, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This very downfield shift indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This finding rules out option A (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene group would be adjacent to a carbonyl, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, confirming the IR data.\n\n**4.

The NMR data does not match a propionate ester.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided IR and NMR data.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This evidence immediately makes option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide** (a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band) highly unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for an amide (like options B and C), which typically absorbs at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at a very downfield 4.5 ppm. This indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nThe combined spectral data points to a molecule with the following fragments:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group where the ethyl is attached to the oxygen (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this evidence:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is Ar-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The ethyl group is part of a propionate. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide (inconsistent IR) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (inconsistent IR and NMR amine signals).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is Ar-COOCH₂CH₃. It has a primary amine, a 1,4-disubstituted ring, and an ethyl ester group. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided data.\n\n### **1.

This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are different electronically; one is electron-donating (the amine), and one is electron-withdrawing (the ester). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded) because they are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded) because they are adjacent to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **4.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   Formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This evidence makes options with secondary amides (D) or primary amides (C) less likely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a simple amide, further ruling out options C and D.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The very high chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial; it indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is consistent with the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined spectral data indicate the molecule contains:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data. The para-substitution explains the two doublets in the NMR, and the electronic nature of the amine and ester groups explains their respective chemical shifts. The ethyl ester and primary amine groups are confirmed by all data points.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (-OCOCH₂CH₃). The methylene protons (-CH₂-) adjacent to the carbonyl would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets. It is also an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR carbonyl frequency.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, contradicting the data.\n\nThe evidence from all spectroscopic methods converges to uniquely identify the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
