It possesses two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂ with Pd/C) is selective for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. The exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced in preference to the endocyclic trisubstituted double bond.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction consumes one equivalent of H₂ to convert the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The structure of Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) is an electrophilic reagent that adds an oxygen atom across the alkene.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 occupies a pseudo-equatorial position in the ring's most stable conformation. It sterically hinders the face of the ring on which it resides. Therefore, the m-CPBA reagent will preferentially attack the double bond from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack). For the (R) configuration at C4, this results in the formation of an epoxide where the oxygen atom is *trans* to the isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe) is a source of the strong nucleophile, the methoxide ion (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regio- and Stereoselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the ring-opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The configuration at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a mild esterification method.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted into a propionate ester. This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the configuration of any of the stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4:** The stereochemistry is retained from Product 3. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy carefully following the reaction sequence and applying the principles of selectivity and stereochemistry, the final product is determined to be (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this name to the provided options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This exactly matches the derived structure.\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would imply retention of configuration during the Sₙ2 attack, which is incorrect.\n*   D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer; the ring double bond was not reduced in this proposed structure.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the key points at each stage to determine the final structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one outside the ring (exocyclic, disubstituted).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C and one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Key Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Key Point (Diastereoselectivity):** The stereochemical outcome of the epoxidation is controlled by the large isopropyl group at C4. To minimize steric hindrance, this group occupies a pseudo-equatorial position in the ring's most stable conformation. It blocks its own face of the ring, forcing the m-CPBA to attack the double bond from the opposite (*trans*) face.\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the epoxide formed from this *trans* attack. Careful stereochemical analysis reveals its structure to be (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Key Points (Regioselectivity and Stereospecificity):**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, and C2 is a secondary carbon, so the methoxide ion (CH₃O⁻) attacks C2.\n    2.  **Stereospecificity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which always proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The configuration at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is therefore **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Key Point (Retention of Configuration):** This is a Steglich esterification. The reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester group without affecting the configuration of any of the stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the (1S, 2S, 4R) stereochemistry. Its full IUPAC name is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final derived structure is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this name to the provided options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This is a perfect match.**\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure; the ring was not opened this way and the double bond should be gone.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would be the product if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is incorrect for an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure for product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: one trisubstituted inside the ring (endocyclic) and one disubstituted outside the ring (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group.

The bulky isopropyl group at C4 will occupy a pseudo-equatorial position in the most stable conformation of the cyclohexene ring. It will sterically block one face of the ring, forcing the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack).\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the epoxide formed by attack *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) are retained.\n    *   Initial configuration: (1**S**, 2**R**, 4**R**)\n    *   Attack at C2 inverts its configuration from (R) to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester.

This large group sterically hinders the face of the ring it is on (*syn*-face). Therefore, the m-CPBA reagent will preferentially attack from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-face).\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The epoxide is formed *trans* to the isopropyl group. To determine the absolute configuration, we can visualize the (R)-isopropyl group on a wedge. The *anti*-attack means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash.\n    *   The stereochemistry of this major epoxide is **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic/nucleophilic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.

This molecule has two C=C double bonds: one is trisubstituted and within the ring (endocyclic), and the other is disubstituted and outside the ring (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with 1 equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Selectivity:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for less sterically hindered and less substituted double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic, disubstituted double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1 to form Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a standard reagent for epoxidation.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. In the most stable conformation (a half-chair), the large isopropyl group occupies a pseudo-equatorial position. For the (R) configuration, this means the m-CPBA will preferentially attack from the face *anti* (trans) to the isopropyl group. This is the major pathway.\n*   **Product 2:** An epoxide is formed across the C1-C2 bond. The oxygen atom is on the face opposite to the isopropyl group. Let's determine the absolute configuration of the major epoxide isomer:\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The attack from the *anti* face results in the formation of new stereocenters at C1 and C2. Careful assignment using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules shows the configuration to be **(1S, 2R)**.\n    *   Therefore, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening of Product 2 to form Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile, methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon. C1 is a tertiary carbon, and C2 is a secondary carbon. The methoxide ion will attack the less substituted carbon, **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) are retained.\n    *   The initial configuration at C2 is (R). After the Sₙ2 attack, it inverts to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The attack of CH₃O⁻ at C2 opens the ring, and the epoxide oxygen at C1 is protonated (by the methanol solvent) to form a hydroxyl group. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification of Product 3 to form Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1 is converted into a propionate ester.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the stereocenters. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe compare the derived name of the final product with the given options:\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would be the product if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is incorrect for an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   B) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer. This would arise from an entirely different and incorrect reaction pathway.\n*   C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and constitutional isomer.\n*   D) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This name and stereochemistry perfectly match the product derived from the logical reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one outside the ring (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) with one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction selectively reduces the less substituted and more sterically accessible double bond. The exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced in preference to the endocyclic trisubstituted double bond. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1=C2). The reaction is diastereoselective, directed by the bulky isopropyl group at C4. In the most stable conformation of the cyclohexene ring, the large isopropyl group occupies a pseudo-equatorial position. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent attacks the double bond from the face *opposite* (anti) to the isopropyl group.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** The (R) configuration at C4 places the isopropyl group on one face of the ring (let's visualize it as a wedge). The m-CPBA attacks from the opposite face (a dash). This results in an epoxide where the oxygen is on the dashed bond. Careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities to the newly formed stereocenters reveals the major epoxide isomer (Product 2) to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, this is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon, so the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) are retained.\n    *   Initial configuration (Product 2): (1**S**, 2**R**, 4**R**)\n    *   The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S).\n    *   Final configuration (Product 3): (1**S**, 2**S**, 4**R**)\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The Steglich esterification is known to proceed with **retention of configuration** at the alcohol's stereocenter.\n*   **Product 4:** The stereochemistry of Product 3 is preserved. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product derived from the reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Now, we compare this name to the given options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This is a perfect match for our derived structure.\n*   **B) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate:** This is an incorrect constitutional isomer; the ring was not hydrogenated correctly.\n*   **C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has the incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would have resulted if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is mechanistically incorrect for this reaction.\n*   **D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has an incorrect numbering scheme and substitution pattern.\n\nThe correct structure is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure for product 4.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n*   **Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n    *   **Reactant:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one outside the ring (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has an (R) configuration.\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of hydrogen.\n    *   **Outcome:** This reaction selectively reduces the less substituted, more accessible double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.\n    *   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n    *   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), an epoxidizing agent.\n    *   **Outcome:** The reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 sterically hinders one face of the cyclohexene ring. To minimize steric repulsion, the m-CPBA attacks the double bond from the face *opposite* (trans) to the isopropyl group.\n    *   **Product 2 (Stereochemistry):** This *trans* attack results in the formation of a specific epoxide diastereomer. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the absolute configuration of this major product to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Outcome:** Under basic conditions, this is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        *   **Regioselectivity:** The methoxide nucleophile (MeO⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary, so the attack occurs at **C2**.\n        *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations at C1 and C4 are retained.\n    *   **Product 3 (Stereochemistry):** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n*   **Step 4: Esterification**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n    *   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n    *   **Outcome:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester.

Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nNow, we compare this derived name with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This exactly matches our derived structure and name.\n*   **B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This has the incorrect stereochemistry at C2. It would be the product if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is incorrect for an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This has an incorrect numbering scheme (the isopropyl group is at C4, not C5) and substitution pattern.\n*   **D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate** - This is a completely different constitutional isomer and is incorrect.\n\nThe correct structure is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points for determining the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one in the side chain (exocyclic, disubstituted). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂ with Pd/C) is selective. It reduces the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond first.\n*   **Careful Point:** With only one equivalent of H₂, only the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1=C2).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 controls the direction of attack. In the most stable conformation, the isopropyl group is in a pseudo-equatorial position. It sterically hinders its own face of the ring, forcing the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite (*anti*) face.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The major product is the epoxide formed from *anti*-attack relative to the isopropyl group. Careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. Here, C1 is a tertiary carbon and C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereochemistry):** This is an Sₙ2 reaction, which always proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The stereochemistry at the other centers (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP. This converts the alcohol into an ester.\n*   **Careful Point:** The Steglich esterification is a mild process that occurs with **retention of configuration** at the alcohol's stereocenter (C1).\n*   **Product 4:** The stereochemistry of Product 3 is preserved. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final derived structure is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic (outside the ring) double bond of the isopropenyl group is disubstituted, whereas the endocyclic (inside the ring) double bond is trisubstituted. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** The epoxidation of the remaining double bond is stereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. In the most stable conformation, the isopropyl group is pseudo-equatorial. For the (R) configuration, this means the m-CPBA will attack from the face *anti* to the isopropyl group.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemical Assignment):** This *anti*-attack results in the formation of a specific epoxide diastereomer. Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major isomer.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The new stereocenter at C1 is **(S)**.\n    *   The new stereocenter at C2 is **(R)**.\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the **(1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the ring-opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, and C2 is a secondary carbon, so the attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) are retained.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the configuration of any of the stereocenters. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe derived structure and name, (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate, must be compared with the given options.\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   B) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure.\n*   D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering of the ring.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a careful, step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is chemically named (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one in the side chain (exocyclic, disubstituted). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation using Pd/C with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted than the endocyclic one. Therefore, the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a standard reagent for forming epoxides from alkenes.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** This step is diastereoselective. The stereochemical outcome is dictated by the large isopropyl group at C4. In the most stable half-chair conformation of the cyclohexene ring, the bulky isopropyl group occupies a pseudo-equatorial position. This group sterically hinders the face of the ring on which it resides (the *syn* face). Consequently, the m-CPBA reagent preferentially attacks from the opposite, less hindered face (the *anti* face).\n*   **Product 2:** An epoxide (Product 2) is formed across the C1-C2 double bond, with the oxygen atom on the face *trans* (opposite) to the isopropyl group. Careful assignment using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules reveals the stereochemistry of this major isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile, methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic/nucleophilic conditions, the ring-opening attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereospecificity:** This is an Sₙ2 reaction, which proceeds with a complete **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) are retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configuration at C1 remains (S), and at C4 remains (R). The epoxide ring opens to form a hydroxyl group at C1 and a methoxy group at C2. The resulting alcohol, Product 3, is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Steglich esterification, which converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom of the alcohol and proceeds with **retention of configuration** at all chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.

The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. In the most stable conformation, the (R)-isopropyl group is pseudo-equatorial. The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the *anti* face.\n*   **Product 2:** An epoxide is formed with the oxygen atom on the face opposite the isopropyl group. This creates two new stereocenters at C1 and C2. Careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities shows that the major epoxide isomer formed is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The epoxide is between C1 (a tertiary carbon) and C2 (a secondary carbon).

It possesses two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one outside the ring (exocyclic, disubstituted).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂ with Pd/C catalyst). The problem specifies that one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed.\n*   **Key Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted than the endocyclic one and is therefore selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1=C2).\n*   **Key Point (Stereoselectivity):** The reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 sterically hinders one face of the ring. In the most stable conformation, the isopropyl group is in a pseudo-equatorial position. The m-CPBA reagent will attack from the less hindered face, which is the face *trans* (opposite) to the isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the epoxide where the oxygen atom is on the opposite side of the ring from the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile, methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Key Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Key Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** This is an Sₙ2 reaction, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The configuration at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Stereochemical Change:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol has the configuration **(1S, 2S, 4R)**. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Key Point (Stereochemistry):** This esterification reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the existing stereocenters. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully following the established mechanisms for each reaction, the major isomer of the final product is determined to be (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this name to the provided options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would result if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this reaction.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and substitution pattern.\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure and stereochemistry.\n*   D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer; the ring structure is wrong.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully executed a step-by-step simulation of the four-stage chemical synthesis.\n\n1.  **Hydrogenation**: The code correctly identified that selective hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene affects the exocyclic double bond, yielding Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene, while retaining the (R) configuration at C4.\n2.  **Epoxidation**: The simulation correctly applied the principle of sterically-directed epoxidation, where the reagent attacks from the face *trans* to the bulky isopropyl group, resulting in the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide (Product 2).\n3.  **Epoxide Opening**: The code correctly modeled the Sₙ2 ring-opening by methoxide at the less-hindered C2 position, which proceeds with inversion of configuration. This correctly transformed the stereochemistry from (1S, 2R, 4R) to (1S, 2S, 4R) for the resulting alcohol (Product 3).\n4.  **Esterification**: The final step was correctly identified as an esterification with retention of configuration, preserving the (1S, 2S, 4R) stereochemistry in the final product (Product 4).\n\nThe chemical logic embedded in the code correctly determined the final product's structure to be **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nThe code's final output message, \"The derived product name does not match any of the options,\" was erroneous due to a minor string formatting issue in the comparison step (it generated \"(S,S,R)\" instead of \"(1S,2S,4R)\"). However, the underlying chemical analysis was sound and points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final structure of product 4.\n\n### **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which has the IUPAC name (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. This molecule contains two carbon-carbon double bonds: one is trisubstituted and inside the ring (endocyclic), while the other is disubstituted and part of a side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at carbon 4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with one equivalent of hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted than the endocyclic one. Therefore, the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a standard reagent for converting an alkene to an epoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is stereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the cyclohexene ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is known as an *anti*-attack. This stereocontrol results in the formation of one major diastereomer.\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the epoxide where the oxygen atom is *trans* to the isopropyl group. The absolute configuration of this epoxide is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile, the methoxide ion (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, the ring-opening of an epoxide is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks C2.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The configuration at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Steglich esterification, a method to form an ester from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not change the configuration of any of the chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing the derived name with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This perfectly matches the derived structure.\n*   **B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has the incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would imply a retention of configuration during the Sₙ2 attack, which is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate:** This is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   **D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has an incorrect numbering scheme and is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The First Reaction - Selective Hydrogenation**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one in the side chain (exocyclic, disubstituted).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Second Reaction - Stereoselective Epoxidation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation with m-CPBA (3-chloroperbenzoic acid).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 dictates the stereochemical outcome. In the most stable conformation of the cyclohexene ring, the isopropyl group occupies a pseudo-equatorial position. This large group sterically hinders the face of the ring it is on (the *syn* face). Consequently, the m-CPBA reagent attacks the double bond from the opposite, less hindered face (the *anti* face).\n*   **Product 2:** An epoxide is formed that is *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Third Reaction - Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** Ring-opening with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic/nucleophilic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. The attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The configuration at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Careful Point 4: The Fourth Reaction - Esterification with Retention**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** Steglich esterification using propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the configuration of any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Final Step: Matching the Product to the Options**\nThe derived name for the final product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Careful stereochemical analysis reveals its structure to be (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Key Points (Regioselectivity and Stereospecificity):**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, and C2 is a secondary carbon, so the methoxide ion (CH₃O⁻) attacks C2.\n    2.  **Stereospecificity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which always proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The configuration at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is therefore **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Key Point (Retention of Configuration):** This is a Steglich esterification. The reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester group without affecting the configuration of any of the stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the (1S, 2S, 4R) stereochemistry. Its full IUPAC name is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final derived structure is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this name to the provided options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This is a perfect match.**\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure; the ring was not opened this way and the double bond should be gone.\n*   D) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would be the product if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is incorrect for an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure for product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: one trisubstituted inside the ring (endocyclic) and one disubstituted outside the ring (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1=C2).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 will occupy a pseudo-equatorial position in the most stable conformation of the cyclohexene ring. It will sterically block one face of the ring, forcing the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack).\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the epoxide formed by attack *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2).

The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. In the most stable conformation (a half-chair), the large isopropyl group occupies a pseudo-equatorial position. For the (R) configuration, this means the m-CPBA will preferentially attack from the face *anti* (trans) to the isopropyl group. This is the major pathway.\n*   **Product 2:** An epoxide is formed across the C1-C2 bond. The oxygen atom is on the face opposite to the isopropyl group. Let's determine the absolute configuration of the major epoxide isomer:\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The attack from the *anti* face results in the formation of new stereocenters at C1 and C2.

C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary, so the attack occurs at **C2**.\n        *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations at C1 and C4 are retained.\n    *   **Product 3 (Stereochemistry):** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S).

Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nNow, we compare this derived name with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This exactly matches our derived structure and name.\n*   **B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This has the incorrect stereochemistry at C2. It would be the product if the epoxide opening occurred with retention of configuration, which is incorrect for an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This has an incorrect numbering scheme (the isopropyl group is at C4, not C5) and substitution pattern.\n*   **D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate** - This is a completely different constitutional isomer and is incorrect.\n\nThe correct structure is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points for determining the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one in the side chain (exocyclic, disubstituted). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂ with Pd/C) is selective. It reduces the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond first.\n*   **Careful Point:** With only one equivalent of H₂, only the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond (C1=C2).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 controls the direction of attack. In the most stable conformation, the isopropyl group is in a pseudo-equatorial position. It sterically hinders its own face of the ring, forcing the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite (*anti*) face.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The major product is the epoxide formed from *anti*-attack relative to the isopropyl group. Careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major epoxide to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. Here, C1 is a tertiary carbon and C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereochemistry):** This is an Sₙ2 reaction, which always proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The stereochemistry at the other centers (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP. This converts the alcohol into an ester.\n*   **Careful Point:** The Steglich esterification is a mild process that occurs with **retention of configuration** at the alcohol's stereocenter (C1).\n*   **Product 4:** The stereochemistry of Product 3 is preserved. The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final derived structure is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. We now compare this to the given options:\n\n*   A) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and structure.\n*   C) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would be the product if the epoxide opening occurred with retention, which is incorrect for an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   D) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - This perfectly matches the structure and stereochemistry derived from the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, highlighting the critical points for determining the final structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C and one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** The reaction involves the selective reduction of one of the two double bonds. Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic (outside the ring) double bond of the isopropenyl group is disubstituted, whereas the endocyclic (inside the ring) double bond is trisubstituted. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** The epoxidation of the remaining double bond is stereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. In the most stable conformation, the isopropyl group is pseudo-equatorial. For the (R) configuration, this means the m-CPBA will attack from the face *anti* to the isopropyl group.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemical Assignment):** This *anti*-attack results in the formation of a specific epoxide diastereomer. Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major isomer.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The new stereocenter at C1 is **(S)**.\n    *   The new stereocenter at C2 is **(R)**.\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the **(1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Careful Point (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the ring-opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, and C2 is a secondary carbon, so the attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) are retained.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to **(S)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the configuration of any of the stereocenters. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe derived structure and name, (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate, must be compared with the given options.\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   B) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure.\n*   D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering of the ring.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a careful, step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is chemically named (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It possesses two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one in the side chain (exocyclic, disubstituted). The stereocenter at C4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation using Pd/C with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted than the endocyclic one. Therefore, the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. Product 1 is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a standard reagent for forming epoxides from alkenes.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** This step is diastereoselective. The stereochemical outcome is dictated by the large isopropyl group at C4. In the most stable half-chair conformation of the cyclohexene ring, the bulky isopropyl group occupies a pseudo-equatorial position. This group sterically hinders the face of the ring on which it resides (the *syn* face). Consequently, the m-CPBA reagent preferentially attacks from the opposite, less hindered face (the *anti* face).\n*   **Product 2:** An epoxide (Product 2) is formed across the C1-C2 double bond, with the oxygen atom on the face *trans* (opposite) to the isopropyl group. Careful assignment using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules reveals the stereochemistry of this major isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile, methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Under basic/nucleophilic conditions, the ring-opening attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Stereospecificity:** This is an Sₙ2 reaction, which proceeds with a complete **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (C2). The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) are retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configuration at C1 remains (S), and at C4 remains (R). The epoxide ring opens to form a hydroxyl group at C1 and a methoxy group at C2. The resulting alcohol, Product 3, is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Steglich esterification, which converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom of the alcohol and proceeds with **retention of configuration** at all chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester. The final product, Product 4, retains the stereochemistry of Product 3.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final structure of Product 4 is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this name to the provided options:\nA) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.

In the most stable conformation, the (R)-isopropyl group is pseudo-equatorial. The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the *anti* face.\n*   **Product 2:** An epoxide is formed with the oxygen atom on the face opposite the isopropyl group. This creates two new stereocenters at C1 and C2. Careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities shows that the major epoxide isomer formed is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The epoxide is between C1 (a tertiary carbon) and C2 (a secondary carbon).

This molecule contains two carbon-carbon double bonds: one is trisubstituted and inside the ring (endocyclic), while the other is disubstituted and part of a side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at carbon 4 has the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with one equivalent of hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. The exocyclic double bond is less substituted than the endocyclic one. Therefore, the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a standard reagent for converting an alkene to an epoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is stereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the cyclohexene ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is known as an *anti*-attack. This stereocontrol results in the formation of one major diastereomer.\n*   **Product 2:** The major product is the epoxide where the oxygen atom is *trans* to the isopropyl group. The absolute configuration of this epoxide is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile, the methoxide ion (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic conditions, the ring-opening of an epoxide is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks C2.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. The configuration at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Steglich Esterification**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Steglich esterification, a method to form an ester from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not change the configuration of any of the chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing the derived name with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This perfectly matches the derived structure.\n*   **B) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has the incorrect stereochemistry at C2, which would imply a retention of configuration during the Sₙ2 attack, which is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate:** This is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   **D) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate:** This has an incorrect numbering scheme and is an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The First Reaction - Selective Hydrogenation**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (4R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: one inside the ring (endocyclic, trisubstituted) and one in the side chain (exocyclic, disubstituted).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is selective for the less sterically hindered and less substituted double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Second Reaction - Stereoselective Epoxidation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation with m-CPBA (3-chloroperbenzoic acid).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is diastereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 dictates the stereochemical outcome. In the most stable conformation of the cyclohexene ring, the isopropyl group occupies a pseudo-equatorial position. This large group sterically hinders the face of the ring it is on (the *syn* face). Consequently, the m-CPBA reagent attacks the double bond from the opposite, less hindered face (the *anti* face).\n*   **Product 2:** An epoxide is formed that is *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities reveals the stereochemistry of this major isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)**-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Third Reaction - Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** Ring-opening with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Analysis:** Under basic/nucleophilic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methoxide, CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. The attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The Sₙ2 attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The configuration at the other stereocenters (C1 and C4) is retained.\n*   **Product 3:** The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to (S). The configurations at C1 and C4 remain (S) and (R), respectively. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)**-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n**Careful Point 4: The Fourth Reaction - Esterification with Retention**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** Steglich esterification using propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect the configuration of any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Final Step: Matching the Product to the Options**\nThe derived name for the final product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Let's compare this to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and substitution.\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect structure.\n*   D) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This is a perfect match.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
