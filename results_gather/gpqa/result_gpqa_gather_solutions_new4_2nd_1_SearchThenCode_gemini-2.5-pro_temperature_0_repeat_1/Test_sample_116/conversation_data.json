A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.\n    *   **Key Feature:** All four positions adjacent to the connecting bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large, bulky substituents (two nitro groups, -NO₂, and two methoxycarbonyl groups, -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This specific arrangement lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Key Feature:** We must check for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center.

This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or from restricted rotation that creates a chiral axis (atropisomerism).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl molecule, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond. All four positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with large, bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution on the rings is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral due to axial chirality and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We must check for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and it therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O, a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a **plane of symmetry**. Furthermore, it possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision**:\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct option is the one that includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo decide the final answer, I will analyze each compound for its potential to exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Key Feature (Atropisomerism):** The positions adjacent to the connecting bond (ortho positions: 2, 2', 6, 6') are all substituted with bulky groups (two nitro groups, -NO₂, and two methoxycarbonyl groups, -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The large size of these groups creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. Because the substitution on each ring is asymmetric, this twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to this restricted rotation (a phenomenon called atropisomerism). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Key Feature (Chiral Center):** We need to check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution on each ring is not symmetric (e.g., a -COOCH₃ group at position 2 and a -NO₂ group at position 6), the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from restricted rotation, is called atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.

This creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule is locked into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure Type:** An ester, also known as methyl lactate.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is the prerequisite for a compound to be optically active. Let's analyze each compound.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure Analysis:** This molecule is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Chirality Check:** The presence of these large groups at all four *ortho* positions creates significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. The molecule is locked into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. Because the substitution on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., a -COOCH₃ group at position 2 and a -NO₂ group at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to this restricted rotation (axial chirality) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group):\n    *   Group 1: -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   Group 2: -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   Group 3: -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the central carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three atoms, so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and thus cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure Analysis:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane is an element of symmetry. Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements (both a plane and a center of symmetry) makes the molecule achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (plane and center of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Core Concept**: A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This often arises from:\n1.  **A chiral center**: An atom (typically carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial chirality**: Restricted rotation about a bond, creating a chiral axis (e.g., atropisomerism in biphenyls).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl system where two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Analysis**: The positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). The large size of these groups creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure**: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Analysis**: We examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure**: (C₆H₅)₂C=O. This is diphenyl ketone.\n*   **Analysis**: The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is only bonded to three atoms. The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure**: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid.\n*   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a **plane of symmetry**. Furthermore, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision**:\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.

This property typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or from restricted rotation that creates an axis of chirality (atropisomerism).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Key Feature (Atropisomerism):** The positions adjacent to the connecting bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by large, bulky substituents: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This makes the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality arising from hindered rotation is known as atropisomerism.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃, also known as methyl lactate.\n*   **Key Feature (Chiral Center):** We need to check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.

The steric hindrance from these groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We must check for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or from restricted rotation that creates a chiral axis (atropisomerism).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl molecule, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond. All four positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with large, bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution on the rings is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral due to axial chirality and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. Because the substitution on each ring is asymmetric, this twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to this restricted rotation (a phenomenon called atropisomerism). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Key Feature (Chiral Center):** We need to check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This makes the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality arising from hindered rotation is known as atropisomerism.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃, also known as methyl lactate.\n*   **Key Feature (Chiral Center):** We need to check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon atom is attached to four different substituents, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n*   **Key Feature (Symmetry):** We need to check for elements of symmetry.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule does not have a chiral center.

A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or from restricted rotation that creates an axis of chirality (atropisomerism).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. All four positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by substituents.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyls, if the *ortho* positions have bulky substituents, free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings is prevented due to steric hindrance.\n*   **Analysis:** The nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) are large and bulky. Their presence at all four *ortho* positions severely restricts rotation, locking the two phenyl rings in a non-planar, twisted conformation. This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral.

Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** The key feature to check in substituted biphenyls is the presence of bulky groups at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). If these groups are large enough, they can prevent the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation can lock the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Analysis:** In this compound, all four ortho-positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). This significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming co-planar. The resulting stable, twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This makes the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation, is known as atropisomerism.\n*   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** The most common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This is known as a chiral center or stereocenter.\n*   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the central carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** A molecule is achiral if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule does not have a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** Like benzophenone, we must check for symmetry elements.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct option must include compounds 1 and 2.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.
