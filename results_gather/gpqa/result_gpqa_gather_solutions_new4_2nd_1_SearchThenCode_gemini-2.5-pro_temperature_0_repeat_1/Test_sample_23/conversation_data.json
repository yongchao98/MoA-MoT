Identification of Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n*   The problem states Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a saturated compound.\n*   It is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   The fact that all other compounds in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z confirms that they all share a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane under severe conditions. The only common substance that fits this description (aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n*   The overall reaction is:\n    `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must also be **18**.\n\n**4. Confirmation of the Components of Mixture X**\n*   To confirm this, we can identify the components A and B. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds, and their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check the conditions:\n    *   **Sum of hydrogens**: 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n    *   **Unsaturated**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. This is correct.\n    *   **No conjugated bonds**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene). This is correct.\n*   The identification of the components of mixture X as cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is consistent with all the information provided and confirms that their combined hydrogen atom count is 18.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: A mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, its formula cannot be that of an alkene (CₙH₂ₙ). It must be a cycloalkane, which also has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The fact that it is a common solvent and is the ultimate product of reactions involving a six-membered ring (as will be shown) strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Let the components of Y be cyclohexane and another liquid, Y'. Since Y' does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. For the hydrogenation of Y' to yield cyclohexane, Y' must have a six-carbon skeleton. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. It undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: `Mixture X → Mixture Y`. Since the mixtures are equimolar, we can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X (A and B) must have a combined formula of C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n*   From the atom balance, we know that **a + b = 18**.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds that fit this. The most common candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two isolated double bonds (non-conjugated). The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded by the problem statement.\n*   Let's check if this pair works: The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Question**: Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**: This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent, it is almost certainly **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The entire mixture Y hydrogenates to only Z. This means the other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Since it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under these conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n\n4.  **Use Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer**: By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the Components of Mixture X (Optional but Recommended)**:\n    *   The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) and have no conjugated bonds.\n    *   Their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n    *   The most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Check: 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n    *   Check conditions: Both are unsaturated. Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. This fits all conditions.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a CₙH₂ₙ compound is calculated as: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (2n × 1) / (n × 12 + 2n × 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   Z is also described as a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the descriptions for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   The most logical candidate for the second component of Y is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is a liquid, is aromatic (and thus does not decolorize bromine water), and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   The formation of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound from an unsaturated cyclic precursor is a classic example of a catalytic disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   This is a balanced reaction where one molecule of A reacts with one molecule of B to produce one molecule of each product.\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   Let's sum the atoms in the products: (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the sum of atoms in the two reactant molecules (A + B) must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the number of hydrogen atoms in the sum of the two reactant molecules.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X = Total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture Y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Identities of the Components of Mixture X (for consistency)**\n*   We know that the components of X (A and B) must both be C₆ cyclic compounds because they both hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   Their hydrogen counts must sum to 18.\n*   They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water).\n*   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n*   The most logical pair of compounds that fits these criteria is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. This fits the criteria.\n*   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer where 1,4-cyclohexadiene donates hydrogen to cyclohexene. This is a chemically sound and consistent explanation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene (10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8), which is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene (CₙH₂ₙ). It must be a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\n*   The fact that it's a common solvent and the central molecule in the subsequent reactions strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This is a consistent conclusion across all detailed analyses.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one component. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Let the other component be D. D does not decolorize bromine water, so it is saturated or aromatic. Hydrogenation of D must yield cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic (so it doesn't react with bromine water under these conditions) and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   **Information:** Mixture X (equimolar, two liquids A and B) undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form Mixture Y.\n*   **Reaction:** A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n*   **Principle of Conservation of Atoms:** This is the most direct way to solve the problem. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture and produces an equimolar mixture, we can consider the reaction of one molecule of A with one molecule of B.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total atoms in the products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the total atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A + one molecule of B) must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   **The Question:** The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This is precisely the number of hydrogen atoms in the sum of the two molecules, which is 18.\n\n**4. Consistency Check (Identifying A and B)**\n*   To be certain, we can identify A and B. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n*   The only pair that fits the condition that their hydrogens sum to 18 is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. This confirms the logic.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene (10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8).\nTotal H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a compound with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n    *   The problem states Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The fact that Z is a widely used solvent and is the sole product of hydrogenating all other compounds (which are clearly C6-based, as will be shown) strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is one component of Y.\n    *   The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane under severe conditions. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic (and thus doesn't react with bromine water) and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   The formation of Y from X is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst.

(Correct)\n        *   Unsaturated: Yes, both have double bonds.\n        *   No conjugated bonds: Correct. Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   This confirms that a chemically plausible mixture X exists that fits all the problem's constraints.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logical steps from the provided answers.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**:\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is characteristic of a compound with the general formula CnH2n, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428`.\n    *   Since Z does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n is a cycloalkane.\n    *   Given that Z is a widely used solvent and the sole product of hydrogenation of all other components, it is almost certainly **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits all the criteria.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   The other component must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane under severe conditions but be unreactive to bromine water. This points to an aromatic compound. The corresponding aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Apply Conservation of Atoms**:\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction:\n        `Mixture X → Mixture Y`\n    *   Since both are equimolar mixtures, we can consider the reaction of one molecule of each component of X to form one molecule of each component of Y:\n        `Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n    *   Let's sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n        Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must also be **18**.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check (Identifying Components of Mixture X)**:\n    *   The components of X (A and B) must be C6 cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   We need two such molecules, C6Ha and C6Hb, where `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Check: 10 + 8 = 18.

Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. If we test the formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. This matches perfectly. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the properties described for Z.\n\n**2. Deduce the Composition of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z as a component. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Y contains cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let the other component be Y'. Y' does not decolorize bromine water (so it's saturated or aromatic) and it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Use Atom Conservation to Analyze Mixture X**\n*   **Information**: Mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y.\n    `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   **Analysis**: Since this is a chemical reaction, atoms must be conserved. The reaction starts with an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) and produces an equimolar mixture of two liquids (cyclohexane and benzene). Therefore, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n    `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    The total number of atoms in the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the total number of atoms in the two molecules of mixture X must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   **Conclusion**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) is 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**4.

The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18.

This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent, it is correctly identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z (cyclohexane) as one of its components. Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This implies the other component of Y must be a substance that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane but is resistant to reaction with bromine water. The only logical candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**, which is aromatic and fits this description. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction involves an equimolar mixture X being converted to an equimolar mixture Y. The overall reaction is:\n    `Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms**: The total number of atoms must be conserved during the chemical reaction. We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of mixture Y):\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane (C6H12) = 12\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in benzene (C6H6) = 6\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n5.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**: According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n6.  **Verify the Components of Mixture X**: The components of X must be C6 cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The pair that fits the hydrogen count of 18 is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, satisfying the condition.\n    *   This confirms the consistency of the entire chemical scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   Z is also described as a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hydrogenation and Carbon Skeleton**\n*   The hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   This is a critical piece of information. It means that all the chemical components in both mixtures must have a six-carbon ring skeleton, as they all convert to cyclohexane upon adding hydrogen.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Since it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with a C₆ skeleton, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is resistant to reaction with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**4. Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n*   The overall reaction is: (Component A + Component B) from Mixture X → (Cyclohexane + Benzene) from Mixture Y.\n*   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n    `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the sum of atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since A and B both have a C₆ skeleton, their formulas are C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. The conservation of hydrogen atoms means that **a + b = 18**.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated. The problem also states they have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   A very common C₆ unsaturated ring is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**. It has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   If one component has 10 hydrogens, the other must have `18 - 10 = 8` hydrogens. This corresponds to a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   There are two main isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   Given the constraint, the second component must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Therefore, mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem presented, and by evaluating the reasoning provided in the candidate answers, the following logical deduction is the most accurate.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n*   The problem states Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and a widely used solvent. This information strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which is a common cycloalkane solvent.\n*   The fact that all components of mixtures X and Y hydrogenate to form only Z confirms that they all share a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X. It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane but be unreactive with bromine water. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under these conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   The formation of mixture Y from mixture X is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. This is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction, given that the mixtures are equimolar, is:\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules is 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = **18**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**Step 4: Confirmation of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   To confirm this, we can identify the components of mixture X. They must be two different C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check the conditions:\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. This fits the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with our calculation from the products.\n    *   In the reaction, the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined by the conservation of atoms from the products (cyclohexane and benzene), this total is 18. This is confirmed by identifying the components of X as cyclohexene (10 H) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 H), which sum to 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a specific class of hydrocarbons.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n*   The value 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Setting the mass fraction to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which gives `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The molecular formula of Z is of the form CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common and well-known cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   A compound that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y from X is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction where an unsaturated cyclic compound is converted into a mixture of a cycloalkane (the reduced product) and an aromatic compound (the oxidized product).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Calculate the Answer**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   Total atoms in the products (one molecule of each) = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the total atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms, this must be the same as the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Identity of Mixture X (Optional but good for verification)**\n*   We need to find two C₆ cyclic compounds, A and B, that are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check:\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. This fits the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with our calculation from the products.\n*   This confirms that the logic is sound.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component. As determined by the conservation of atoms from the products (cyclohexane and benzene), this sum is 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (2n × 1) / (n × 12 + 2n × 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, which matches the given value of 14.28%.\n*   The problem also states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a component of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This implies that the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   A substance that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Disproportionation Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction, which is a type of disproportionation.\n*   The overall reaction, considering one molecule of each component in the equimolar mixtures, is:\n    Liquid A + Liquid B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (from Mixture Y)\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n**4. Confirmation of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   To confirm this, we can identify the components of mixture X. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds that, upon hydrogenation, yield cyclohexane. They must also lack conjugated double bonds.\n*   The two most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check if they fit the criteria:\n    *   **Unsaturated**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **No Conjugated Bonds**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which is conjugated). This fits the condition.\n    *   **Sum of Hydrogen Atoms**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 18. This matches our calculation from the conservation of atoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. The information that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent strongly points to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction, is equimolar, and does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). The hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. This implies the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and be convertible to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since it doesn't react with bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic, resistant to bromination under these conditions, and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**: The core of the problem lies in the disproportionation reaction where mixture X is converted to mixture Y:\n    `Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n\n    Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (A and B) and produces an equimolar mixture (cyclohexane and benzene), the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n\n    *   Total atoms in the products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the total atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms, this must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane = 12\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in benzene = 6\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**Careful Points and Confirmation**\n\n*   The components of mixture X must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The pair that fits this description and whose atoms sum to C₁₂H₁₈ is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result obtained from the conservation of atoms principle.\n*   A significant number of the candidate answers contain typographical errors, where the correct reasoning leads to the number 18, but the wrong letter option is selected. The correct option for the answer 18 is D.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the reasoning of the provided answers, combined with a careful step-by-step analysis, confirms that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The molecular formula of Z is of the form CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information.\n\n### Step 2: Deduce the Composition of Mixture Y\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of its components. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Let the components of Y be Z (cyclohexane) and another liquid, Y'.\n    *   Since Y' is part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water, Y' must be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y' must yield cyclohexane. If Y' were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), it would not react, and the final product would be a mixture, which contradicts the problem statement.\n    *   Therefore, Y' must be an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only C₆ aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated, non-conjugated liquids. It undergoes a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\n    `Mixture X → Mixture Y`\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Atom Conservation**: Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture and produces an equimolar mixture, we can balance the atoms for a 1:1 reaction. The total number of atoms in the products is C₁₂H₁₈ (from C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆). Therefore, the two molecules making up mixture X must also have a total formula of C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   **Identifying A and B**:\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, so both A and B must be C₆ cyclic compounds.\n    *   Let A be C₆Hₐ and B be C₆Hₑ. From atom conservation, we know `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Both A and B are unsaturated and non-conjugated. The most plausible candidates are:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond, so it's not conjugated.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n    *   Checking the hydrogen sum for this pair: 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. This pair fits all the conditions of the problem.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\n\n*   **Question**: Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**: This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This percentage is characteristic of a compound with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. Since Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), it must be a cycloalkane. Given that it is a widely used solvent and the sole product of all hydrogenation reactions in the problem, Z is correctly identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. A substance that has a six-carbon ring, does not react with bromine water, and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Disproportionation Reaction**: The core of the problem is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be represented as one molecule of each component of X forming one molecule of each component of Y:\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n\n4.  **Application of the Law of Conservation of Atoms**: This principle provides the most direct solution. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane = 12\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of benzene = 6\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### Careful Points and Verification\n\n*   **Consistency of Mixture X**: To ensure the scenario is chemically possible, we must verify that a plausible Mixture X exists. The components must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have no conjugated multiple bonds, and both must be C₆ cyclic compounds (to hydrogenate to cyclohexane). Their total hydrogen count must be 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all these conditions perfectly. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result obtained through the conservation law.\n*   **Clerical Errors in Candidate Answers**: A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning is almost universally correct in identifying the total hydrogen count as 18, many of them select the wrong final option letter (e.g., choosing A, B, or C instead of D). This highlights the importance of carefully matching the calculated result to the given options.\n*   **Direct vs. Indirect Solution**: The most efficient solution path is using the conservation of atoms, which does not require the explicit identification of the components of mixture X. Identifying them serves as a valuable confirmation of the logic.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Identification of Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n*   The problem states Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a saturated compound.\n*   It is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   The fact that all other compounds in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z confirms that they all share a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane under severe conditions. The only common substance that fits this description (aromatic and hydrogenates to cyclohexane) is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n*   The overall reaction is:\n    `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must also be **18**.\n\n**4. Confirmation of the Components of Mixture X**\n*   To confirm this, we can identify the components A and B. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds, and their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check the conditions:\n    *   **Sum of hydrogens**: 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n    *   **Unsaturated**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. This is correct.\n    *   **No conjugated bonds**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene). This is correct.\n*   The identification of the components of mixture X as cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is consistent with all the information provided and confirms that their combined hydrogen atom count is 18.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: A mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, its formula cannot be that of an alkene (CₙH₂ₙ). It must be a cycloalkane, which also has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The fact that it is a common solvent and is the ultimate product of reactions involving a six-membered ring (as will be shown) strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Let the components of Y be cyclohexane and another liquid, Y'. Since Y' does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. For the hydrogenation of Y' to yield cyclohexane, Y' must have a six-carbon skeleton. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds. It undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: `Mixture X → Mixture Y`. Since the mixtures are equimolar, we can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X (A and B) must have a combined formula of C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n*   From the atom balance, we know that **a + b = 18**.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆ cyclic compounds that fit this. The most common candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two isolated double bonds (non-conjugated). The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded by the problem statement.\n*   Let's check if this pair works: The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Question**: Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**: This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent, it is almost certainly **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The entire mixture Y hydrogenates to only Z. This means the other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Since it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under these conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n\n4.  **Use Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer**: By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the Components of Mixture X (Optional but Recommended)**:\n    *   The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water) and have no conjugated bonds.\n    *   Their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n    *   The most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Check: 10 + 8 = 18. This is correct.\n    *   Check conditions: Both are unsaturated. Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. This fits all conditions.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a CₙH₂ₙ compound is calculated as: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (2n × 1) / (n × 12 + 2n × 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   Z is also described as a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the descriptions for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   The most logical candidate for the second component of Y is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is a liquid, is aromatic (and thus does not decolorize bromine water), and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   The formation of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound from an unsaturated cyclic precursor is a classic example of a catalytic disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   This is a balanced reaction where one molecule of A reacts with one molecule of B to produce one molecule of each product.\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   Let's sum the atoms in the products: (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the sum of atoms in the two reactant molecules (A + B) must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the number of hydrogen atoms in the sum of the two reactant molecules.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X = Total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture Y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Identities of the Components of Mixture X (for consistency)**\n*   We know that the components of X (A and B) must both be C₆ cyclic compounds because they both hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   Their hydrogen counts must sum to 18.\n*   They must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water).\n*   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n*   The most logical pair of compounds that fits these criteria is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. This fits the criteria.\n*   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer where 1,4-cyclohexadiene donates hydrogen to cyclohexene. This is a chemically sound and consistent explanation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene (10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8), which is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene (CₙH₂ₙ). It must be a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\n*   The fact that it's a common solvent and the central molecule in the subsequent reactions strongly suggests it is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This is a consistent conclusion across all detailed analyses.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one component. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** Let the other component be D. D does not decolorize bromine water, so it is saturated or aromatic. Hydrogenation of D must yield cyclohexane.

The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture and produces an equimolar mixture, we can consider the reaction of one molecule of A with one molecule of B.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total atoms in the products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the total atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A + one molecule of B) must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   **The Question:** The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This is precisely the number of hydrogen atoms in the sum of the two molecules, which is 18.\n\n**4. Consistency Check (Identifying A and B)**\n*   To be certain, we can identify A and B. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n*   The only pair that fits the condition that their hydrogens sum to 18 is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.

Y' does not decolorize bromine water (so it's saturated or aromatic) and it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Use Atom Conservation to Analyze Mixture X**\n*   **Information**: Mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y.\n    `Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   **Analysis**: Since this is a chemical reaction, atoms must be conserved. The reaction starts with an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) and produces an equimolar mixture of two liquids (cyclohexane and benzene). Therefore, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n    `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    The total number of atoms in the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the total number of atoms in the two molecules of mixture X must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   **Conclusion**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) is 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**4. Confirm the Identities of Components in Mixture X (Verification)**\n*   **Information**: The two liquids in X are unsaturated, have no conjugated bonds, and both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   **Analysis**: We need two C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   The cyclohexadiene must be non-conjugated, which means it is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Both have a C₆ ring and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The components of X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe analysis consistently points to a total of 18 hydrogen atoms. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent, it is correctly identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z (cyclohexane) as one of its components. Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This implies the other component of Y must be a substance that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane but is resistant to reaction with bromine water. The only logical candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**, which is aromatic and fits this description. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction involves an equimolar mixture X being converted to an equimolar mixture Y. The overall reaction is:\n    `Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms**: The total number of atoms must be conserved during the chemical reaction. We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of mixture Y):\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane (C6H12) = 12\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in benzene (C6H6) = 6\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18\n\n5.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**: According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n6.  **Verify the Components of Mixture X**: The components of X must be C6 cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The pair that fits the hydrogen count of 18 is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, satisfying the condition.\n    *   This confirms the consistency of the entire chemical scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   Z is also described as a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hydrogenation and Carbon Skeleton**\n*   The hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   This is a critical piece of information. It means that all the chemical components in both mixtures must have a six-carbon ring skeleton, as they all convert to cyclohexane upon adding hydrogen.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Since it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with a C₆ skeleton, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is resistant to reaction with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**4. Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n*   The overall reaction is: (Component A + Component B) from Mixture X → (Cyclohexane + Benzene) from Mixture Y.\n*   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n    `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the sum of atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since A and B both have a C₆ skeleton, their formulas are C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ. The conservation of hydrogen atoms means that **a + b = 18**.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated. The problem also states they have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   A very common C₆ unsaturated ring is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**. It has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   If one component has 10 hydrogens, the other must have `18 - 10 = 8` hydrogens. This corresponds to a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   There are two main isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   Given the constraint, the second component must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Therefore, mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem presented, and by evaluating the reasoning provided in the candidate answers, the following logical deduction is the most accurate.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n*   The problem states Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and a widely used solvent. This information strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which is a common cycloalkane solvent.\n*   The fact that all components of mixtures X and Y hydrogenate to form only Z confirms that they all share a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X. It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane but be unreactive with bromine water. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under these conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   The formation of mixture Y from mixture X is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. This is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction, given that the mixtures are equimolar, is:\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (Mixture Y)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules is 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = **18**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**Step 4: Confirmation of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   To confirm this, we can identify the components of mixture X. They must be two different C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), non-conjugated, and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check the conditions:\n    *   Both are unsaturated.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. This fits the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with our calculation from the products.\n    *   In the reaction, the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. As determined by the conservation of atoms from the products (cyclohexane and benzene), this total is 18. This is confirmed by identifying the components of X as cyclohexene (10 H) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 H), which sum to 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a specific class of hydrocarbons.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n*   The value 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Setting the mass fraction to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which gives `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The molecular formula of Z is of the form CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common and well-known cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that the other component of Y must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   A compound that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y from X is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction where an unsaturated cyclic compound is converted into a mixture of a cycloalkane (the reduced product) and an aromatic compound (the oxidized product).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Calculate the Answer**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   Total atoms in the products (one molecule of each) = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Therefore, the total atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms, this must be the same as the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Identity of Mixture X (Optional but good for verification)**\n*   We need to find two C₆ cyclic compounds, A and B, that are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check:\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. This fits the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with our calculation from the products.\n*   This confirms that the logic is sound.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component. As determined by the conservation of atoms from the products (cyclohexane and benzene), this sum is 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (2n × 1) / (n × 12 + 2n × 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, which matches the given value of 14.28%.\n*   The problem also states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a component of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This implies that the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   A substance that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Disproportionation Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction, which is a type of disproportionation.\n*   The overall reaction, considering one molecule of each component in the equimolar mixtures, is:\n    Liquid A + Liquid B (from Mixture X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆) (from Mixture Y)\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n**4. Confirmation of the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   To confirm this, we can identify the components of mixture X. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds that, upon hydrogenation, yield cyclohexane. They must also lack conjugated double bonds.\n*   The two most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check if they fit the criteria:\n    *   **Unsaturated**: Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **No Conjugated Bonds**: Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which is conjugated). This fits the condition.\n    *   **Sum of Hydrogen Atoms**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 18. This matches our calculation from the conservation of atoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the disproportionation reaction, this number is equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (cyclohexane and benzene), which is 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 12\nD) 18\n\nThe calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully executed the plan to solve the chemical puzzle.

This numerical result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical problem, a consistent and logical solution emerges.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass ratio of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. The information that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent strongly points to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction, is equimolar, and does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). The hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. This implies the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and be convertible to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since it doesn't react with bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic, resistant to bromination under these conditions, and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Mixture X**: The core of the problem lies in the disproportionation reaction where mixture X is converted to mixture Y:\n    `Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n\n    Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (A and B) and produces an equimolar mixture (cyclohexane and benzene), the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n\n    *   Total atoms in the products = (C₆H₁₂) + (C₆H₆) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   Therefore, the total atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be C₁₂H₁₈.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms, this must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane = 12\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in benzene = 6\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**Careful Points and Confirmation**\n\n*   The components of mixture X must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds that decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The pair that fits this description and whose atoms sum to C₁₂H₁₈ is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result obtained from the conservation of atoms principle.\n*   A significant number of the candidate answers contain typographical errors, where the correct reasoning leads to the number 18, but the wrong letter option is selected. The correct option for the answer 18 is D.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the reasoning of the provided answers, combined with a careful step-by-step analysis, confirms that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is also saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The molecular formula of Z is of the form CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information.\n\n### Step 2: Deduce the Composition of Mixture Y\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of its components. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: Let the components of Y be Z (cyclohexane) and another liquid, Y'.\n    *   Since Y' is part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water, Y' must be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y' must yield cyclohexane. If Y' were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), it would not react, and the final product would be a mixture, which contradicts the problem statement.\n    *   Therefore, Y' must be an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only C₆ aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Mixture X\n\n*   **Information**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated, non-conjugated liquids. It undergoes a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\n    `Mixture X → Mixture Y`\n    `Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Atom Conservation**: Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture and produces an equimolar mixture, we can balance the atoms for a 1:1 reaction. The total number of atoms in the products is C₁₂H₁₈ (from C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆). Therefore, the two molecules making up mixture X must also have a total formula of C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   **Identifying A and B**:\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, so both A and B must be C₆ cyclic compounds.\n    *   Let A be C₆Hₐ and B be C₆Hₑ. From atom conservation, we know `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Both A and B are unsaturated and non-conjugated. The most plausible candidates are:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond, so it's not conjugated.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n    *   Checking the hydrogen sum for this pair: 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. This pair fits all the conditions of the problem.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\n\n*   **Question**: Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**: This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
