This corresponds to the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka₂).\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since Ka₃ is very small, the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible).\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (5.0562 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated concentration, 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M, is closest to option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Always convert the volume from cm³ to Liters (1 cm³ = 0.001 L) for molarity calculations.\n*   **Correct Molar Mass:** Be sure to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O), not the anhydrous form.\n*   **Choosing the Right Ka:** The [H⁺] is determined by the main buffer pair (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻), so Ka₂ is used first. The target ion [PO₄³⁻] is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, so Ka₃ is used in the final step.\n*   **Buffer Assumption:** The calculation assumes that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations. This is a valid assumption because the Ka values are small, and the common ion effect in the buffer minimizes dissociation.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.

The target ion [PO₄³⁻] is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, so Ka₃ is used in the final step.\n*   **Buffer Assumption:** The calculation assumes that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations. This is a valid assumption because the Ka values are small, and the common ion effect in the buffer minimizes dissociation.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.
