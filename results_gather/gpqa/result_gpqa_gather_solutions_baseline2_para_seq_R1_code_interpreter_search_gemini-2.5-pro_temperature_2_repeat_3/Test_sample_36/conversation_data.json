Your analysis is perfectly correct and provides an excellent summary of the reasoning behind the 13C NMR spectrum of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\nIt accurately highlights the key points:\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The high degree of symmetry in the molecule is the crucial factor that reduces the number of signals.\n2.  **Equivalent Carbons:** This symmetry results in three distinct sets of chemically equivalent carbons:\n    *   The two alkene carbons (C=C).\n    *   The four methylene carbons (-CH₂-).\n    *   The four methyl carbons (-CH₃-).\n3.  **Three Signals:** Consequently, the spectrum displays exactly three signals, which confirms the answer to the original question.\n\nThe predicted chemical shift ranges you've provided are also typical for these types of carbon environments. This information provides a solid chemical basis for the solution.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) and Ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HS-CH2-CH2-SH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a thioacetal. The aldehyde is protected by forming a 1,3-dithiolane ring. The Lewis acid BF3 catalyzes the reaction.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    *   Structure: The C=O group of propionaldehyde is replaced by a C atom single-bonded to two S atoms which are part of a five-membered ring. The original ethyl group (CH3CH2-) is attached to this carbon.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the original aldehyde proton) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the two adjacent sulfur atoms (an example of umpolung).\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion. The carbon at position 2 of the ring now bears a negative charge and is associated with a Li+ cation, making it a potent nucleophile.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product B (the nucleophilic carbanion) and Bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The carbanion from B attacks the electrophilic ethyl group of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product C:** An ethyl group is added to the C2 position of the dithiolane ring. The starting material already had an ethyl group at this position. The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and reagents for deprotection (HgCl2, H2O, H+).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of the thioacetal (deprotection) to regenerate a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The protecting group is removed, and the carbon atom that was part of the dithiolane ring becomes a carbonyl carbon. Since it is bonded to two ethyl groups, the product is a ketone.\n    *   Structure: Diethyl ketone, or 3-pentanone: CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH3.\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product D (3-pentanone) and the reagents for a Wittig reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction, which converts a ketone into an alkene.\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH3CH2)2CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt, [(CH3CH2)2CH-P(Ph)3]+Br-. Then, the strong base BuLi deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form the phosphorus ylide: (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3.\n    2.  **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone and the PPh3 group of the ylide are eliminated (as Ph3P=O), and a new carbon-carbon double bond is formed between the ketone carbon and the ylide carbon.\n*   **Product E:**\n    *   Ketone part: (CH3CH2)2C=\n    *   Ylide part: =C(CH2CH3)2\n    *   Combining them gives: (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this molecule is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique carbon environments in the final product E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n          CH2CH3\n          |\n    CH3CH2-C=C-CH2CH3\n              |\n              CH2CH3\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C double bond and multiple C2 axes of rotation. Because of this symmetry:\n    1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  All four ethyl groups attached to the double bond are chemically equivalent.\n    3.  Within each ethyl group, the methylene carbon (-CH2-) is distinct from the methyl carbon (-CH3).\n    4.  Therefore, all four methylene carbons (-CH2-) are equivalent to each other. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    5.  All four methyl carbons (-CH3) are equivalent to each other. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, the molecule has three distinct types of carbon atoms.\n\n*   Signal 1: from the two equivalent C=C carbons.\n*   Signal 2: from the four equivalent -CH2- carbons.\n*   Signal 3: from the four equivalent -CH3 carbons.\n\nThus, the 13C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 3\nC) 6\nD) 11\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify the final product E and determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) and Ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH2CH2SH).\n*   **Reagent:** BF3 (Boron trifluoride) is a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reaction for the protection of a carbonyl group as a cyclic thioacetal. The aldehyde's carbonyl group reacts with the two thiol groups of EDT.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    ```\n          S\n         / \\\n    CH3CH2-CH   CH2\n         \\ /\n          S--CH2\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane).\n*   **Reagent:** BuLi (Butyllithium) is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi abstracts the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (the original aldehyde proton) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This concept is known as Umpolung (reversal of polarity).\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion. The carbon that was electrophilic in propionaldehyde is now a nucleophile.\n    ```\n          S\n         / \\\n    CH3CH2-C(-)Li(+)   CH2\n         \\ /\n          S----CH2\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product B (the nucleophilic carbanion).\n*   **Reagent:** Bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The carbanion of B attacks the electrophilic CH2 carbon of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Product C:** An ethyl group is added to the C2 position of the dithiolane ring, resulting in 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    ```\n        CH2CH3\n       /\n    S--C--S\n    |  |  |\n    CH2-CH2\n       \\\n        CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane).\n*   **Reagents:** HgCl2, H2O, and H+ (acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** These are the conditions for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of a thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The thioacetal is hydrolyzed to a ketone. The product is 3-pentanone.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n    CH3CH2-C-CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product D (3-pentanone).\n*   **Reagents:** This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents are used to form a phosphorus ylide, which then reacts with the ketone.\n    1.  **Ylide Formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) reacts with 3-bromopentane (CH3CH2CH(Br)CH2CH3) to form a phosphonium salt, [Ph3P-CH(CH2CH3)2]+Br-. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon attached to the phosphorus to form the Wittig reagent (ylide), Ph3P=C(CH2CH3)2.\n    2.  **Wittig Reaction:** The ketone (3-pentanone) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and the PPh3 group of the ylide are eliminated, forming a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Reaction:** (CH3CH2)2C=O + Ph3P=C(CH2CH3)2 → E + Ph3P=O\n*   **Product E:** The final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n    ```\n          CH2CH3  CH2CH3\n             \\    /\n              C==C\n             /    \\\n      CH3CH2      CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nTo determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in the molecule. This is done by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of E, (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2, is highly symmetrical.\n*   There is a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond, perpendicular to the bond.\n*   There is a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (`=C<`) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n2.  All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n3.  Within the four equivalent ethyl groups, the four methylene carbons (`-CH2-`) are chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n4.  Similarly, the four methyl carbons (`-CH3`) are chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique carbon environments is 3. The 13C-NMR spectrum of product E will show 3 signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product E.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) and Ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH2CH2SH).\n*   **Catalyst:** BF3 (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a thioacetal, specifically a 1,3-dithiolane. The aldehyde's carbonyl group reacts with the two thiol groups of EDT.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    *   Structure: An ethyl group (CH3CH2-) is attached to a carbon which is part of a 5-membered ring containing two sulfur atoms (the dithiolane ring).\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the former aldehydic proton) is acidic because the resulting negative charge (carbanion) is stabilized by the two adjacent sulfur atoms (an application of the Corey-Seebach reaction, or \"umpolung\"). This step is incorrect. The starting aldehyde is propionaldehyde, so A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. The acidic proton is on C2, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n*   **Correction:** The acidic proton is on C2 of the dithiolane ring.\n    CH3CH2-CH(S-CH2-CH2-S) + BuLi → [CH3CH2-C(-)(S-CH2-CH2-S)] Li+ + Butane\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane anion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n*   **Reactants:** Product B (the lithiated carbanion) and Bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The carbanion is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an SN2 reaction. An ethyl group is added to the carbon that was deprotonated.\n*   **Product C:** The carbon at position 2 of the dithiolane ring, which initially had one ethyl group, now has two ethyl groups attached. The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D**\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and reagents for deprotection.\n*   **Reaction:** These reagents (mercuric chloride, water, and acid) are used to hydrolyze the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The dithiolane is removed, and the carbon atom becomes a carbonyl carbon. The two ethyl groups remain attached. The product is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** (CH3CH2-CO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n*   **Reaction:** This combination of reagents points to a **Wittig reaction**.\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) reacts with 3-bromopentane (CH3CH2-CH(Br)-CH2CH3) to form a phosphonium salt, [CH3CH2-CH(PPh3+)-CH2CH3]Br-. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon attached to phosphorus to form the phosphorus ylide: CH3CH2-C(=PPh3)-CH2CH3, which is (pentan-3-ylidene)triphenylphosphine.\n    2.  **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone).\n        (CH3CH2)2C=O + (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3 → (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH2)2 + Ph3P=O\n*   **Product E:** The final product is tetraethylethene, with the systematic IUPAC name **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR signals of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nThe structure of E is highly substituted around the double bond:\n       CH2CH3\n       |\nCH3CH2-C=C-CH2CH3\n       |\n       CH2CH3\n\nThis molecule can exist as E and Z isomers. The Wittig reaction involves a stabilized ylide reacting with a ketone, which typically produces a mixture of E and Z isomers. For the purpose of counting NMR signals, we must consider the signals from both isomers in the final product mixture.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Signal Count for each Isomer:**\n    *   **E-isomer:** Possesses a center of inversion (Ci). It is achiral. The two ethyl groups on one vinylic carbon are diastereotopic. This leads to 5 distinct signals: 1 for the two equivalent alkene carbons, and 4 for the non-equivalent CH2 and CH3 groups of the two types of ethyl environments.\n    *   **Z-isomer:** Possesses a C2 axis of rotation. It is chiral. Similar to the E-isomer, the two ethyl groups on one vinylic carbon are diastereotopic. This also leads to 5 distinct signals.\n\n*   **Signal Count for the Mixture:**\n    Since E is a mixture of E and Z isomers, and the signals for each isomer are generally different, the spectrum of the mixture will contain signals from both.\n    *   E-isomer signals: {C=C_E, CH2_E1, CH3_E1, CH2_E2, CH3_E2}\n    *   Z-isomer signals: {C=C_Z, CH2_Z1, CH3_Z1, CH2_Z2, CH3_Z2}\n\n    In a complex mixture like this, it is unlikely that signals will perfectly overlap, but for pedagogical problems, a plausible simplification is often assumed. A common scenario is that carbons in similar environments but in different stereoisomers show distinct signals, while those further from the stereocenter might overlap.\n\n    Let's consider a plausible scenario for the mixture's spectrum:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The chemical environment of the alkene carbons is significantly different in the E and Z isomers. We expect two signals.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH2-):** The four CH2 groups in each isomer are diastereotopic and exist in two pairs. The stereochemistry (E vs. Z) will likely make all four CH2 environments across the two isomers distinct. We expect four signals for the CH2 groups.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH3):** The methyl groups are further away from the double bond. It is plausible that their chemical shifts are less sensitive to the E/Z geometry, leading to accidental overlap. For instance, the two \"outer\" methyl groups (one from E, one from Z) might have similar shifts, and the two \"inner\" methyl groups might have similar shifts. This would result in two signals for the four types of methyl groups.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    Summing these up: 2 (from C=C) + 4 (from -CH2-) + 2 (from -CH3) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis hypothesis provides a logical path to one of the given options by considering the likely outcome of the reaction (E/Z mixture) and plausible behavior in an NMR spectrum. While simpler analyses might yield 3 or 5 signals, these are not options that can be fully justified in the context of a mixture. The alternative reaction pathway (enolate alkylation) is less likely given the explicit mention of PPh3 and leads to products with a different number of signals (10 or 11). Therefore, the most reasonable answer is 8.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, E.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and Ethanedithiol (HSCH₂CH₂SH, abbreviated as EDT).\n*   **Catalyst:** BF₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the protection of an aldehyde using a dithiol to form a cyclic dithioacetal. The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by two sulfur atoms from ethanedithiol, forming a 1,3-dithiane ring.\n*   **Product A:** The product is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. The carbon that was the aldehyde carbon (C2 of the dithiane ring) is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reactants:** A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane) and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent sulfur atoms. This type of reaction, creating a nucleophilic acyl anion equivalent, is known as the Corey-Seebach reaction (an example of umpolung).\n*   **Product B:** The product is a lithiated carbanion, specifically the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane anion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reactants:** B (the lithiated carbanion) and Bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The carbanion (B) is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This step adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position of the dithiane ring.\n*   **Product C:** The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reactants:** C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane) and reagents for deprotection (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** These reagents are used to hydrolyze the dithioacetal, removing the protecting group and regenerating a carbonyl group. The Hg²⁺ ion has a high affinity for sulfur, facilitating the cleavage of the C-S bonds.\n*   **Product D:** Since the original C2 carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting carbonyl compound is a ketone with two ethyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. This is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reactants:** D (3-pentanone), Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction. The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine reacts with the alkyl halide (3-bromopentane) to form a phosphonium salt. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form a phosphorus ylide.\n        *   PPh₃ + (CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr → [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻\n        *   [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻ + BuLi → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ (the ylide)\n    2.  **Wittig reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone (D, 3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide, forming a C=C double bond.\n        *   (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n*   **Product E:** The final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Its structure is (Et)₂C=C(Et)₂, where Et represents an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR Spectrum of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nThe structure of E is:\n```\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\n\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. We can identify the chemically equivalent carbons to determine the number of distinct signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** There is a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C double bond. This makes the two carbons of the double bond chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n2.  **Ethyl Group Carbons:** The molecule has four identical ethyl groups attached to the double bond. Due to the high degree of symmetry (including a C₂ axis perpendicular to the C=C bond), all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Within the four equivalent ethyl groups, the four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four methyl (-CH₃) carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n\nIn total, we have three sets of chemically equivalent carbons:\n*   The two sp² carbons of the alkene.\n*   The four sp³ methylene carbons.\n*   The four sp³ methyl carbons.\n\nTherefore, the final product E will produce **3 signals** in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 6\nC) 11\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product E, followed by the prediction of the number of 13C-NMR signals.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n\n*   **Propionaldehyde** has the structure CH₃CH₂CHO.\n*   **EDT** is ethane-1,2-dithiol (HSCH₂CH₂SH).

The reagents are used to first create a phosphorus ylide from 3-bromopentane, which then reacts with the ketone D.\n    *   Ylide formation: 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) + PPh₃ followed by BuLi creates the ylide (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   Wittig reaction: The ketone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃) to form an alkene.\n    *   Product E is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nNow we must determine the number of unique carbon environments in the final product, E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene).\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the midpoint of the C=C bond and perpendicular to it. This symmetry makes many carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Identifying Equivalent Carbons:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (`=C<`)**: The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (`-CH₂-`)**: There are four ethyl groups attached to the double bond. The symmetry ensures all four ethyl groups are equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (`-CH₃`)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons of the equivalent ethyl groups are also chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of distinct carbon signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum is the sum of the unique environments: 1 (for `=C<`) + 1 (for `-CH₂-`) + 1 (for `-CH₃`) = **3 signals**.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 6\nB) 8\nC) 11\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Your analysis is perfectly correct and provides an excellent summary of the reasoning behind the 13C NMR spectrum of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\nIt accurately highlights the key points:\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The high degree of symmetry in the molecule is the crucial factor that reduces the number of signals.\n2.  **Equivalent Carbons:** This symmetry results in three distinct sets of chemically equivalent carbons:\n    *   The two alkene carbons (C=C).\n    *   The four methylene carbons (-CH₂-).\n    *   The four methyl carbons (-CH₃-).\n3.  **Three Signals:** Consequently, the spectrum displays exactly three signals, which confirms the answer to the original question.\n\nThe predicted chemical shift ranges you've provided are also typical for these types of carbon environments. This information provides a solid chemical basis for the solution.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) and Ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HS-CH2-CH2-SH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a thioacetal. The aldehyde is protected by forming a 1,3-dithiolane ring. The Lewis acid BF3 catalyzes the reaction.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    *   Structure: The C=O group of propionaldehyde is replaced by a C atom single-bonded to two S atoms which are part of a five-membered ring. The original ethyl group (CH3CH2-) is attached to this carbon.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the original aldehyde proton) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the two adjacent sulfur atoms (an example of umpolung).\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion. The carbon at position 2 of the ring now bears a negative charge and is associated with a Li+ cation, making it a potent nucleophile.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product B (the nucleophilic carbanion) and Bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The carbanion from B attacks the electrophilic ethyl group of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product C:** An ethyl group is added to the C2 position of the dithiolane ring. The starting material already had an ethyl group at this position. The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and reagents for deprotection (HgCl2, H2O, H+).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of the thioacetal (deprotection) to regenerate a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The protecting group is removed, and the carbon atom that was part of the dithiolane ring becomes a carbonyl carbon. Since it is bonded to two ethyl groups, the product is a ketone.\n    *   Structure: Diethyl ketone, or 3-pentanone: CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH3.\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product D (3-pentanone) and the reagents for a Wittig reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction, which converts a ketone into an alkene.\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH3CH2)2CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt, [(CH3CH2)2CH-P(Ph)3]+Br-. Then, the strong base BuLi deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form the phosphorus ylide: (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3.\n    2.  **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone and the PPh3 group of the ylide are eliminated (as Ph3P=O), and a new carbon-carbon double bond is formed between the ketone carbon and the ylide carbon.\n*   **Product E:**\n    *   Ketone part: (CH3CH2)2C=\n    *   Ylide part: =C(CH2CH3)2\n    *   Combining them gives: (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this molecule is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique carbon environments in the final product E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n          CH2CH3\n          |\n    CH3CH2-C=C-CH2CH3\n              |\n              CH2CH3\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C double bond and multiple C2 axes of rotation. Because of this symmetry:\n    1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  All four ethyl groups attached to the double bond are chemically equivalent.\n    3.  Within each ethyl group, the methylene carbon (-CH2-) is distinct from the methyl carbon (-CH3).\n    4.  Therefore, all four methylene carbons (-CH2-) are equivalent to each other. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    5.  All four methyl carbons (-CH3) are equivalent to each other. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, the molecule has three distinct types of carbon atoms.\n\n*   Signal 1: from the two equivalent C=C carbons.\n*   Signal 2: from the four equivalent -CH2- carbons.\n*   Signal 3: from the four equivalent -CH3 carbons.\n\nThus, the 13C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 3\nC) 6\nD) 11\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify the final product E and determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) and Ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH2CH2SH).\n*   **Reagent:** BF3 (Boron trifluoride) is a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reaction for the protection of a carbonyl group as a cyclic thioacetal. The aldehyde's carbonyl group reacts with the two thiol groups of EDT.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    ```\n          S\n         / \\\n    CH3CH2-CH   CH2\n         \\ /\n          S--CH2\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane).\n*   **Reagent:** BuLi (Butyllithium) is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi abstracts the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (the original aldehyde proton) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This concept is known as Umpolung (reversal of polarity).\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion. The carbon that was electrophilic in propionaldehyde is now a nucleophile.\n    ```\n          S\n         / \\\n    CH3CH2-C(-)Li(+)   CH2\n         \\ /\n          S----CH2\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product B (the nucleophilic carbanion).\n*   **Reagent:** Bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The carbanion of B attacks the electrophilic CH2 carbon of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Product C:** An ethyl group is added to the C2 position of the dithiolane ring, resulting in 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    ```\n        CH2CH3\n       /\n    S--C--S\n    |  |  |\n    CH2-CH2\n       \\\n        CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane).\n*   **Reagents:** HgCl2, H2O, and H+ (acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** These are the conditions for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of a thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The thioacetal is hydrolyzed to a ketone. The product is 3-pentanone.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n    CH3CH2-C-CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product D (3-pentanone).\n*   **Reagents:** This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents are used to form a phosphorus ylide, which then reacts with the ketone.\n    1.  **Ylide Formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) reacts with 3-bromopentane (CH3CH2CH(Br)CH2CH3) to form a phosphonium salt, [Ph3P-CH(CH2CH3)2]+Br-. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon attached to the phosphorus to form the Wittig reagent (ylide), Ph3P=C(CH2CH3)2.\n    2.  **Wittig Reaction:** The ketone (3-pentanone) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and the PPh3 group of the ylide are eliminated, forming a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Reaction:** (CH3CH2)2C=O + Ph3P=C(CH2CH3)2 → E + Ph3P=O\n*   **Product E:** The final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n    ```\n          CH2CH3  CH2CH3\n             \\    /\n              C==C\n             /    \\\n      CH3CH2      CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nTo determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in the molecule. This is done by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of E, (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2, is highly symmetrical.\n*   There is a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond, perpendicular to the bond.\n*   There is a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (`=C<`) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n2.  All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n3.  Within the four equivalent ethyl groups, the four methylene carbons (`-CH2-`) are chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n4.  Similarly, the four methyl carbons (`-CH3`) are chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique carbon environments is 3. The 13C-NMR spectrum of product E will show 3 signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product E.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) and Ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH2CH2SH).\n*   **Catalyst:** BF3 (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a thioacetal, specifically a 1,3-dithiolane. The aldehyde's carbonyl group reacts with the two thiol groups of EDT.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    *   Structure: An ethyl group (CH3CH2-) is attached to a carbon which is part of a 5-membered ring containing two sulfur atoms (the dithiolane ring).\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the former aldehydic proton) is acidic because the resulting negative charge (carbanion) is stabilized by the two adjacent sulfur atoms (an application of the Corey-Seebach reaction, or \"umpolung\"). This step is incorrect. The starting aldehyde is propionaldehyde, so A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. The acidic proton is on C2, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n*   **Correction:** The acidic proton is on C2 of the dithiolane ring.\n    CH3CH2-CH(S-CH2-CH2-S) + BuLi → [CH3CH2-C(-)(S-CH2-CH2-S)] Li+ + Butane\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane anion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n*   **Reactants:** Product B (the lithiated carbanion) and Bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The carbanion is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an SN2 reaction. An ethyl group is added to the carbon that was deprotonated.\n*   **Product C:** The carbon at position 2 of the dithiolane ring, which initially had one ethyl group, now has two ethyl groups attached. The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D**\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and reagents for deprotection.\n*   **Reaction:** These reagents (mercuric chloride, water, and acid) are used to hydrolyze the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The dithiolane is removed, and the carbon atom becomes a carbonyl carbon. The two ethyl groups remain attached. The product is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** (CH3CH2-CO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n*   **Reaction:** This combination of reagents points to a **Wittig reaction**.\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) reacts with 3-bromopentane (CH3CH2-CH(Br)-CH2CH3) to form a phosphonium salt, [CH3CH2-CH(PPh3+)-CH2CH3]Br-. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon attached to phosphorus to form the phosphorus ylide: CH3CH2-C(=PPh3)-CH2CH3, which is (pentan-3-ylidene)triphenylphosphine.\n    2.  **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone).\n        (CH3CH2)2C=O + (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3 → (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH2)2 + Ph3P=O\n*   **Product E:** The final product is tetraethylethene, with the systematic IUPAC name **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR signals of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nThe structure of E is highly substituted around the double bond:\n       CH2CH3\n       |\nCH3CH2-C=C-CH2CH3\n       |\n       CH2CH3\n\nThis molecule can exist as E and Z isomers. The Wittig reaction involves a stabilized ylide reacting with a ketone, which typically produces a mixture of E and Z isomers. For the purpose of counting NMR signals, we must consider the signals from both isomers in the final product mixture.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Signal Count for each Isomer:**\n    *   **E-isomer:** Possesses a center of inversion (Ci). It is achiral. The two ethyl groups on one vinylic carbon are diastereotopic. This leads to 5 distinct signals: 1 for the two equivalent alkene carbons, and 4 for the non-equivalent CH2 and CH3 groups of the two types of ethyl environments.\n    *   **Z-isomer:** Possesses a C2 axis of rotation. It is chiral. Similar to the E-isomer, the two ethyl groups on one vinylic carbon are diastereotopic. This also leads to 5 distinct signals.\n\n*   **Signal Count for the Mixture:**\n    Since E is a mixture of E and Z isomers, and the signals for each isomer are generally different, the spectrum of the mixture will contain signals from both.\n    *   E-isomer signals: {C=C_E, CH2_E1, CH3_E1, CH2_E2, CH3_E2}\n    *   Z-isomer signals: {C=C_Z, CH2_Z1, CH3_Z1, CH2_Z2, CH3_Z2}\n\n    In a complex mixture like this, it is unlikely that signals will perfectly overlap, but for pedagogical problems, a plausible simplification is often assumed. A common scenario is that carbons in similar environments but in different stereoisomers show distinct signals, while those further from the stereocenter might overlap.\n\n    Let's consider a plausible scenario for the mixture's spectrum:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The chemical environment of the alkene carbons is significantly different in the E and Z isomers. We expect two signals.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH2-):** The four CH2 groups in each isomer are diastereotopic and exist in two pairs. The stereochemistry (E vs. Z) will likely make all four CH2 environments across the two isomers distinct. We expect four signals for the CH2 groups.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH3):** The methyl groups are further away from the double bond. It is plausible that their chemical shifts are less sensitive to the E/Z geometry, leading to accidental overlap. For instance, the two \"outer\" methyl groups (one from E, one from Z) might have similar shifts, and the two \"inner\" methyl groups might have similar shifts. This would result in two signals for the four types of methyl groups.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    Summing these up: 2 (from C=C) + 4 (from -CH2-) + 2 (from -CH3) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis hypothesis provides a logical path to one of the given options by considering the likely outcome of the reaction (E/Z mixture) and plausible behavior in an NMR spectrum. While simpler analyses might yield 3 or 5 signals, these are not options that can be fully justified in the context of a mixture. The alternative reaction pathway (enolate alkylation) is less likely given the explicit mention of PPh3 and leads to products with a different number of signals (10 or 11). Therefore, the most reasonable answer is 8.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, E.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and Ethanedithiol (HSCH₂CH₂SH, abbreviated as EDT).\n*   **Catalyst:** BF₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the protection of an aldehyde using a dithiol to form a cyclic dithioacetal. The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by two sulfur atoms from ethanedithiol, forming a 1,3-dithiane ring.\n*   **Product A:** The product is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. The carbon that was the aldehyde carbon (C2 of the dithiane ring) is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reactants:** A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane) and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent sulfur atoms. This type of reaction, creating a nucleophilic acyl anion equivalent, is known as the Corey-Seebach reaction (an example of umpolung).\n*   **Product B:** The product is a lithiated carbanion, specifically the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane anion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reactants:** B (the lithiated carbanion) and Bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The carbanion (B) is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This step adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position of the dithiane ring.\n*   **Product C:** The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reactants:** C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane) and reagents for deprotection (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** These reagents are used to hydrolyze the dithioacetal, removing the protecting group and regenerating a carbonyl group. The Hg²⁺ ion has a high affinity for sulfur, facilitating the cleavage of the C-S bonds.\n*   **Product D:** Since the original C2 carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting carbonyl compound is a ketone with two ethyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. This is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reactants:** D (3-pentanone), Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction. The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine reacts with the alkyl halide (3-bromopentane) to form a phosphonium salt. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form a phosphorus ylide.\n        *   PPh₃ + (CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr → [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻\n        *   [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻ + BuLi → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ (the ylide)\n    2.  **Wittig reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone (D, 3-pentanone).

The strong base BuLi then deprotonates the carbon attached to the phosphorus, forming the phosphorus ylide: (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3.\n    2.  **Wittig Olefination:** The ylide ((CH3CH2)2C=PPh3) reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone, (CH3CH2)2C=O). The oxygen atom of the ketone is exchanged with the carbon group from the ylide.\n*   **Product E:** The reaction `(CH3CH2)2C=O + Ph3P=C(CH2CH3)2` yields the alkene **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene** ((CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2) and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3PO).\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe final product is E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Let's analyze its structure for chemical equivalence to determine the number of 13C-NMR signals.\n\nStructure of E:\n```\n      CH3-CH2   CH2-CH3\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH3-CH2   CH2-CH3\n```\n\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical.\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry containing the C=C bond and a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the midpoint of the C=C bond, perpendicular to the first plane. Due to this symmetry, the two carbons of the double bond are chemically equivalent. This will produce **1 signal**.\n2.  **Ethyl Group Carbons:** The symmetry of the molecule makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Within each ethyl group, there is a methylene carbon (-CH2-) and a methyl carbon (-CH3).\n    *   **Methylene Carbons (-CH2-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, all four methylene carbons are also equivalent. This will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methyl Carbons (-CH3):** Similarly, all four methyl carbons are equivalent. This will produce **1 signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three distinct types of carbon atoms in the molecule E.\n*   Signal 1: The two alkene carbons.\n*   Signal 2: The four methylene carbons.\n*   Signal 3: The four methyl carbons.\n\nTherefore, the 13C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 8\nB) 11\nC) 3\nD) 6\n\nOur calculated number of signals is 3, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
