The weight fraction of the yield is equivalent to the mole fraction (or mole percent) of the para-isomer in the product mixture, as all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given starting material have the same molar mass.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. This property determines the primary positions of electrophilic attack.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (like alkyls) or halogens.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Methyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chloro): Deactivating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups, typically containing a partial or full positive charge on the atom attached to the ring (e.g., due to a double or triple bond to a more electronegative atom).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl carboxylate): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the Groups based on Directing Effect**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce significant amounts. Therefore, the three meta-directing compounds will have the lowest para-yields.\n\nThe order will be: {compounds 2, 4, 6} < {compounds 1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds (4, 6, 2)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. The stronger the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position, the lower the yield of the ortho and para isomers will be.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nThis gives the beginning of our sequence as: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho,Para-Directing Compounds (1, 3, 5)**\nFor ortho,para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. The para position is generally favored over the ortho position due to less steric hindrance. This effect is more pronounced for larger substituents.\n\n*   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1)**\n*   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5)**\n*   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3)**\n\nThe steric hindrance of the substituent increases in the order: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5.\nA simple steric argument would suggest that the preference for the para position, and thus the para-yield, should increase in the same order: Cl < CH3 < C2H5, which corresponds to `3 < 1 < 5`.\n\nHowever, electronic effects are also important. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position, which also increases para selectivity. Experimental data for bromination shows the following approximate para-isomer yields:\n*   Toluene (1): ~67%\n*   Chlorobenzene (3): ~87%\n*   Ethylbenzene (5): ~94%\n\nSo, the correct experimental order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5). This corresponds to the sequence `1 < 3 < 5`.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Orders and Select the Best Option**\nCombining the order of the two groups:\n*   From meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   From ortho,para-directors (using experimental data): `1 < 3 < 5`\n\nThe full, chemically correct order is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5`.\n\nNow let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nNone of the options perfectly matches our derived order `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5`. This indicates a likely error in the question or options. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on our most certain conclusions:\n1.  The order for meta-directors `4 < 6 < 2` is based on fundamental principles of electronic effects.\n2.  Only **Option A** starts with this correct sequence: `4<6<2...`.\n\nLet's examine the rest of Option A: `...1<5<3`. This implies the para-yield order for o,p-directors is Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This contradicts our experimental data, which shows Ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than Chlorobenzene (`...1<3<5`).\n\nHowever, the error in the other options is more significant. For example, Option D suggests the order `4<2<6...`, which incorrectly states that ethyl benzoate gives less para-product than benzoic acid.\n\nGiven the choices, Option A is the most plausible answer because it correctly orders the meta-directing groups, which is a key part of the problem based on well-established chemical principles. The error in the latter part of the sequence is likely a flaw in the question's construction.\n\nFinal derived order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** (as per Option A)\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the *increasing* percentage yield of the para-brominated product.\n\nThe substances are:\n1) ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the key factor that determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. Substituents can be classified as either:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyls) or weakly deactivating groups (like halogens).\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves. They are typically deactivating groups.\n\nLet's classify each substituent:\n*   **1) -CH3 (methyl group):** An alkyl group. It is activating and **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **2) -COOC2H5 (ester group):** An electron-withdrawing group. It is deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **3) -Cl (chloro group):** A halogen. It is deactivating but **ortho, para-directing** due to its lone pairs.\n*   **4) -NO2 (nitro group):** A strongly electron-withdrawing group. It is strongly deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **5) -C2H5 (ethyl group):** An alkyl group. It is activating and **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid group):** An electron-withdrawing group. It is deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Meta-Directing Group**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yields of the ortho and para isomers will be very low.\nThe meta-directors are: -NO2 (4), -COOH (6), and -COOC2H5 (2).\n\nTo rank them by their para-isomer yield, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to a higher selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the minor para product.\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is stronger than the ester group because the alkyl group in the ester is weakly electron-donating, slightly reducing the deactivating effect of the carbonyl.)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three substances is the reverse of their deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of both ortho and para isomers. The para-isomer is usually favored, especially when steric hindrance at the ortho positions is significant.\nThe ortho, para-directors are: -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3).\n\nTo rank them, we need to consider the para/ortho ratio, which is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. The electrophile in bromination (Br+, or more accurately the Br2-Lewis acid complex) is relatively large, making steric effects important.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 and -C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para product than toluene.\n    *   Order: C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5)\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl:** The chloro group is a single atom, but it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect which deactivates the ring, particularly at the ortho positions. This electronic effect reinforces the steric preference for the para position. Experimental data for bromination shows that chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 89%), which is higher than that for toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Rankings**\n\nThe meta-directing group will always produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho, para-directing group. So, we can combine the two ranked lists.\n\n*   Lowest para yields (meta-directors): 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Highest para yields (ortho, para-directors): 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining these gives the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-X) as either activating or deactivating, and determine its directing effect (ortho, para-directing or meta-directing).\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):**\n    *   Substituent: -CH3 (methyl)\n    *   Classification: Activating group (donates electron density via induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director**.\n\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):**\n    *   Substituent: -COOC2H5 (ester)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (withdraws electron density via resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -Cl (chloro)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (strong inductive withdrawal outweighs weak resonance donation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director** (due to resonance).\n\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   Classification: Strongly deactivating group (withdraws electron density via induction and resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -C2H5 (ethyl)\n    *   Classification: Activating group (donates electron density via induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director**.\n\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):**\n    *   Substituent: -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (withdraws electron density via resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely related to the strength of the deactivating (and thus meta-directing) effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe meta-directing substances are:\n*   4) C6H5-NO2\n*   6) C6H5-COOH\n*   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n\nThe general order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the group that deactivates the most (-NO2) will yield the least para-isomer, and the group that deactivates the least among these three (-COOC2H5) will yield the most (though still a very small amount).\n\nThe order of increasing para-isomer yield for this subset is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends on steric and electronic factors.\n\nThe ortho, para-directing substances are:\n*   1) C6H5-CH3\n*   5) C6H5-C2H5\n*   3) C6H5-Cl\n\nLet's compare them:\n\n*   **1 (-CH3) vs. 5 (-C2H5):** Both are alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile (Br+) at the nearby ortho positions more effectively, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Consequently, ethylbenzene will have a higher para/ortho ratio and a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director, but it is deactivating. Its directing effect is governed by a balance of a strong, distance-dependent inductive withdrawal (-I effect) and a resonance donation (+R effect). The -I effect deactivates all positions, but it is strongest at the ortho positions and weakest at the para position. This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position over the ortho position, leading to a very high para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (around 89% in bromination). This yield is typically higher than that for toluene (~67%). The trend of increasing para yield with alkyl group size (CH3 < C2H5 < t-butyl) shows that for t-butylbenzene, the para yield is about 84%. It is reasonable to assume the para yield for ethylbenzene will be between that of toluene (67%) and t-butylbenzene (84%), and therefore less than that of chlorobenzene (89%).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Orders\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors (4, 6, 2) produce extremely low yields of the para-isomer (typically <5%), while the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) produce high yields (typically >60%). Therefore, all meta-directors will come before all ortho, para-directors in the final ranking.\n\nCombining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This property determines the primary positions where the incoming bromine atom will attach.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating. The yield of the para-isomer from these substances will be very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the general order.**\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-isomer compared to ortho,para-directors, the substances with meta-directing groups will come first in the sequence (lowest yield), followed by the substances with ortho,para-directing groups.\n\nThe order will look like: {meta-directors} < {ortho,para-directors}.\nSo, {4, 2, 6} < {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6).**\nThe question asks for the order of *increasing* yield of the para-isomer. For meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is minimal, but we can still rank them. The ranking depends on how strongly each group directs to the meta position. A stronger meta-director will result in a lower yield of any ortho or para products. The strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect for these groups is generally accepted as:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nThis means the -NO2 group is the most effective at directing to the meta position, and thus will produce the *least* amount of para-isomer. The -COOC2H5 group is the least effective meta-director among the three, so it will produce the *most* para-isomer (although still a very small amount).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\n\n**Step 4: Rank the substances with ortho,para-directing groups (1, 5, 3).**\nFor these substances, we need to consider the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho product. The main factor is steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. As a result, substitution at the less hindered para position is favored. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Considering -Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating, they are ortho,para-directors. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the chlorine atom deactivates the entire ring, but it deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with some steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for substitution at the para position. The yield of the para-isomer for the bromination of chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the rankings into the final order.**\nNow we combine the rankings from Step 2, 3, and 4.\n\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the factors influencing product distribution.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (C6H5-) determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. This is known as the directing effect. The question asks for the weight fraction of the para-isomer. Since all possible monobrominated products (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material are isomers, they have the same molar mass. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is equal to its mole fraction or percentage yield.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nWe need to classify each substituent as either activating (and ortho, para-directing) or deactivating (and meta-directing or ortho, para-directing).\n\n*   **Group A: Meta-directing deactivators.** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n*   **Group B: Ortho, para-directors.** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances in Group A will have the lowest para-yields, and the substances in Group B will have the highest para-yields. So, the final order will look like {Group A substances} < {Group B substances}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within Group A (meta-directors).**\nFor meta-directing groups, a stronger deactivating effect leads to a higher proportion of the meta-isomer and, consequently, a lower proportion of the para-isomer. The order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5\nUsing the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\nApproximate para-yields from literature confirm this: Nitrobenzene (~0.3%), Benzoic acid (~2%), Ethyl benzoate (~4%).\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within Group B (ortho, para-directors).**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on a balance of electronic effects and steric hindrance. The para position is generally favored to avoid steric clash with the existing substituent.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is significantly bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes para-substitution much more favorable for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Yield: p-bromotoluene ~67%.\n    *   Yield: p-bromoethylbenzene ~94%.\n    *   Therefore, the order is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive effect (-I), but it directs ortho/para due to its resonance effect (+R). The -I effect is strongest at the ortho position, which deactivates it more than the para position. This results in a high preference for para substitution.\n    *   Yield: p-bromotoluene ~67%.\n    *   Yield: p-bromochlorobenzene ~87%.\n    *   Therefore, the order is: **1 < 3**.\n\n*   **Comparing Chlorobenzene (3) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both substituents lead to a high para-yield. The steric effect of the bulky ethyl group in (5) is slightly more dominant in favoring the para position than the electronic effect in chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   Yield: p-bromochlorobenzene ~87%.\n    *   Yield: p-bromoethylbenzene ~94%.\n    *   Therefore, the order is: **3 < 5**.\n\nCombining the results for Group B, we get the order of increasing para-yield:\nToluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5)\nThe order is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the ordered groups.**\nWe combine the order from Group A and Group B to get the final overall order:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\nFinal order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare the derived order with the given options.**\n*   Our derived order: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect)\n*   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Incorrect, but very close)\n*   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect)\n*   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect)\n\nLet's analyze option B: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\nThis option correctly orders the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2). It also correctly identifies that the meta-directors have lower para-yields than the ortho, para-directors. It correctly identifies toluene (1) as having the lowest para-yield among the o,p-directors. The only discrepancy is the order of the last two substances, ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). Option B states 5 < 3, while our data shows 3 < 5 (87% < 94%).\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question, and option B is correct in almost all aspects, differing only by a single pairwise comparison at the end, it is the most plausible answer. It is highly likely that there is a typographical error in the option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on substituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the given substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-bromo isomer. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the mole fraction (percentage yield) of the para-isomer, as all monobromo-isomers of a given substance have the same molar mass.\n\nThe substances are:\n1)  C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2)  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3)  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4)  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5)  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6)  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This effect determines where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   -CH3 (Toluene) and -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Alkyl groups are weakly activating and o,p-directing.\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Halogens are deactivating but o,p-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating and m-directing.\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid): Moderately deactivating and m-directing.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Moderately deactivating and m-directing.\n\n**3. General Yield Comparison**\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups** yield ortho and para isomers as the major products. The yield of the para-isomer is substantial (typically >30%).\n*   **Meta-directing groups** yield the meta isomer as the major product. The yields of ortho and para isomers are very low (typically <5-10%).\n\nTherefore, any substance with an o,p-directing group will produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer than any substance with an m-directing group. This allows us to split the list into two parts:\nLow para yield: (Nitrobenzene, Benzoic acid, Ethyl benzoate)\nHigh para yield: (Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Chlorobenzene)\n\n**4. Ordering within the Meta-Directing Group (Low Para Yield)**\n\nThe substances are Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), and Ethyl benzoate (2). All are m-directors. The question asks for the yield of the para-isomer, which is a minor product for these compounds. The amount of the minor (ortho/para) products formed is inversely related to how strongly the substituent deactivates the ring. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   **-NO2:** Very strong deactivating effect (strong -I inductive effect and -R resonance effect).\n*   **-COOH:** Strong deactivating effect (-I and -R effects).\n*   **-COOC2H5:** Strong deactivating effect (-I and -R effects). The alkyl group (-C2H5) has a slight electron-donating (+I) effect, which makes the -COOC2H5 group slightly less deactivating than the -COOH group.\n\nSo, the order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**5. Ordering within the Ortho-, Para-Directing Group (High Para Yield)**\n\nThe substances are Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3). For these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho isomers. The formation of the para-isomer is generally favored over the ortho-isomer due to steric hindrance from the substituent.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3) vs. Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the attack at the para position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While chlorine is less bulky than a methyl group, it has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I). This effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the more distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that bromination of chlorobenzene yields nearly 90% para-isomer, which is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (~76%).\n    *   Order: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**6. Final Overall Ordering**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered lists. The group of m-directors comes first (lowest para yield), followed by the group of o,p-directors (highest para yield).\n\n*   Order of m-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of o,p-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Question**\n\nThe question asks to arrange six monosubstituted benzene compounds in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** formed during electrophilic bromination.\n\nThe compounds are:\n1.  **Toluene (C6H5-CH3):** -CH3 is an alkyl group.\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group.\n3.  **Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl):** -Cl is a halogen.\n4.  **Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2):** -NO2 is a nitro group.\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group.\n6.  **Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe ortho-, meta-, and para-isomers of a specific brominated compound (e.g., bromotoluene) all have the same molecular formula and thus the same molecular weight. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (or percentage yield). The question is equivalent to arranging the compounds by the increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to specific positions.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   `-CH3` (Toluene, 1)\n    *   `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating) but can donate electron density via resonance (ortho-, para-directing).\n    *   `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, especially from the ortho and para positions, making the meta position the most favorable for attack. These will produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene, 4) - Strongly deactivating\n    *   `-COOH` (Benzoic acid, 6) - Deactivating\n    *   `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate, 2) - Deactivating\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nThe compounds with meta-directing groups (4, 6, and 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ortho/para positions and directs meta.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It directs almost exclusively to the meta position, resulting in a negligible amount of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6):** This is also a strong deactivating group, but generally considered less deactivating than the nitro group. It will produce a very small amount of para-isomer, but slightly more than nitrobenzene (typically 1-2%).\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2):** The ester group is also deactivating and meta-directing, with a strength comparable to the carboxylic acid group, but often considered slightly weaker. It will produce more para-isomer than both nitrobenzene and benzoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho-, Para-Directing Compounds (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nThe compounds with ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, and 3) will have high yields of the para-isomer. The order among them depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **-Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although the -Cl group deactivates the ring, it strongly favors the para position over the ortho position for substitution. This is because its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is most felt at the closer ortho positions, disfavoring attack there relative to the more distant para position. Thus, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 89%). This will be the highest in the entire set.\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The main difference affecting the para/ortho ratio is sterics. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. As a result, substitution at the less hindered para position becomes more favorable for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   *Conclusion based on sterics*: para% (Toluene) < para% (Ethylbenzene).\n    *   This gives the order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\nCombining the ortho-, para-directors, we get the order of increasing para yield:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Orders and Select the Answer**\n\nNow, combine the two groups. The meta-directors have very low para yields, and the ortho-, para-directors have high para yields.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho-, para-directors order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining these two sequences gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nNow, we match this order with the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe derived order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the question.**\nThe reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of six different substituted benzene compounds. We need to arrange these compounds in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*. The weight fraction of an isomer is directly proportional to its mole fraction (percentage yield), as all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material have the same molar mass. Therefore, we need to rank the compounds based on the percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their effect on the reaction rate (activating/deactivating) and the position of substitution (directing effect).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (in Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing group:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density via induction (deactivating) but direct to ortho and para positions via resonance.\n    *   3) -Cl (in Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   4) -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) -COOH (in Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for each group.**\n\n*   **Meta-directors (compounds 4, 2, 6):** These substances will yield the meta-isomer as the major product. The yields of ortho- and para-isomers will be very low. To rank them, we consider that a stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield will be the reverse of this: C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\n    *   Approximate para-yields: Nitrobenzene (~0.1%), Benzoic acid (~1-2%), Ethyl benzoate (~2-3%).\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors (compounds 1, 5, 3):** These substances will yield significant amounts of both ortho- and para-isomers. The ratio between the ortho and para products is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent on the ring will block the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the sterically accessible para position.\n    *   Let's compare the sizes of the substituents: -C2H5 is significantly bulkier than -CH3. The -Cl atom is similar in size to the -CH3 group.\n    *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** The methyl group offers some steric hindrance. Bromination yields about 67% para-isomer.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The bulkier ethyl group provides much more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer, about 94%.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** The chloro group's size and strong inductive deactivation at the ortho position favor para substitution. The para-isomer yield is high, about 89%.\n    *   Comparing the percentage yields: 67% (Toluene) < 89% (Chlorobenzene) < 94% (Ethylbenzene).\n    *   So, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Step 4: Combine the groups and determine the final order.**\nThe meta-directors (4, 6, 2) will have much lower para-yields than the ortho-, para-directors (1, 3, 5). Combining the orders from Step 3 gives the complete sequence:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the derived order with the given options.**\nThe theoretically correct order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5.\nLet's check the options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect.\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4<6<2) and correctly identifies toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para-yield. However, it incorrectly swaps the positions of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3), stating that the para yield of (5) is less than (3) (94% < 89% is false).\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect. It gets the order of meta-directors wrong (2<6) and o,p-directors wrong (3<1).\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect. It gets the order of meta-directors wrong and o,p-directors wrong (5<1).\n\nAmong the given choices, option B has the most correct elements. It correctly groups and orders the meta-directors and correctly places toluene relative to the other o,p-directors. The only error is the inversion of the last two compounds. In the context of a multiple-choice question with a likely error in the options, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of a series of monosubstituted benzenes. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the increasing yield of the para-monobromo derivative. The weight fraction of the yield is directly related to the molar percentage yield, as the molar masses of the products are reasonably similar. Therefore, we can focus on ordering by the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is crucial. We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating group (+I effect, hyperconjugation). Ortho, para-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating group (+I effect, hyperconjugation). Ortho, para-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating group (-I effect > +M effect) but is an ortho, para-director due to resonance (+M effect) stabilizing the intermediate carbocation.\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)**: Deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Grouping\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will form very little para-isomer, while those with ortho, para-directing groups will form a significant amount of the para-isomer. Therefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing substances first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\nOrder: (Group of 2, 4, 6) < (Group of 1, 3, 5)\n\n### Step 4: Rank the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)\nFor meta-directors, the main product is the meta-isomer. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts. The selectivity for the meta position increases with the electron-withdrawing (deactivating) strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a lower yield of the disfavored para and ortho isomers.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the group that is most strongly deactivated (-NO2) will produce the least amount of para-isomer. The order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n### Step 5: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)\nFor these substances, both ortho and para isomers are major products. The ratio between them (and thus the percentage yield of the para-isomer) depends on a combination of electronic and steric effects. The incoming electrophile is a bromine atom, which is relatively large, so steric hindrance is an important factor.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the product being the para-isomer. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5)**: The chloro group is a special case. It deactivates the ring through its strong inductive effect (-I), but directs ortho/para via its resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor strongly disfavors ortho substitution, leading to a very high selectivity for the para position. Experimental data confirms that the para/ortho ratio for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Approximate para-yields in bromination: Toluene (~67%), Ethylbenzene (~70%), Chlorobenzene (~88%).\n\nBased on this, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nC6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Rankings\nNow, we combine the rankings from the two groups:\n\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires us to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction. The regioselectivity (ortho, meta, or para) of this reaction is governed by the nature of the substituent already present on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the substituents\nWe first need to classify each substituent as either activating or deactivating, and as an ortho/para-director or a meta-director.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **1) -CH3 (methyl):** Activating.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (ethyl):** Activating.\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-directing groups:** Halogens are a special case. They withdraw electron density via induction (deactivating) but donate via resonance, making them ortho/para directors.\n    *   **3) -Cl (chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho/para-directing.\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester):** Deactivating.\n    *   **4) -NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid):** Deactivating.\n\n### Step 2: Separate the substances into two main groups\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups:\n*   **Group A (Low para yield):** The meta-directors will produce very little para-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **Group B (High para yield):** The ortho/para-directors will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have substances from Group A first, followed by substances from Group B.\n\n### Step 3: Order the substances within Group A (meta-directors)\nWe need to arrange substances 2, 4, and 6 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. For meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to more selective meta-substitution, and thus an even lower yield of the minor ortho and para products.\nThe order of deactivating strength is generally:\n-NOโ > -COOH > -COOCโHโ\nThis means the -NOโ group is the strongest meta-director, leading to the lowest para yield. The -COOCโHโ group is the weakest deactivator in this set, leading to the highest para yield among the three.\nSo, the order of *increasing* para yield is:\n**4 (-NOโ) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOCโHโ)**\n\n### Step 4: Order the substances within Group B (ortho/para-directors)\nWe need to arrange substances 1, 3, and 5 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by sterics and electronics.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CHโ) and 5 (-CโHโ):** The ethyl group (-CโHโ) is larger (sterically bulkier) than the methyl group (-CHโ). This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile at the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, thus increasing the relative yield of the para-isomer. So, the para yield for ethylbenzene will be higher than for toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** Halogens, like chlorine, are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, their strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho positions more than the para position. This, combined with sterics, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data confirms that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a significantly higher percentage of the para-isomer (~87%) compared to toluene (~62%) and ethylbenzene (~68%).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Step 5: Combine the ordered groups\nNow we combine the order from Step 3 and Step 4. The substances in Group A have a much lower para yield than those in Group B.\n\nCombining (4 < 6 < 2) and (1 < 5 < 3), we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic substitution (bromination). The substituent on the benzene ring determines where the incoming electrophile (Brโบ) will add. We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho,para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They generally result in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CHโ (Methyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   **5) -CโHโ (Ethyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho,para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very small, almost negligible, amounts of the ortho and para isomers.\n    *   **4) -NOโ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **2) -COOCโHโ (Ethyl ester):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\nFrom this classification, we know that substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer, while substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest yield. The final sequence will look like this: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}.\n\n**2. Rank the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The amount of para product formed is inversely related to the strength of the group's deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will \"enforce\" meta-direction more strongly, leading to an even smaller percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established:\n-NOโ > -COOH > -COOCโHโ\n(Nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid, which is slightly stronger than an ester).\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\nYield for -NOโ < Yield for -COOH < Yield for -COOCโHโ\n\nThis gives us the order for the first part of the sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**3. Rank the Ortho,Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho,para-directors, the proportion of the para-isomer depends on a balance of steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CHโ (1) and -CโHโ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The main difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-CโHโ) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CHโ). This bulkiness hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Para % for -CHโ < Para % for -CโHโ\n    *   This gives the relative order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups with -Cl (3):** Chlorine is a halogen. Halogens have a unique combination of effects: they are deactivating due to a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but they are ortho,para-directing due to an electron-donating resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect is strongest at the closest positions (ortho) and weaker at the more distant para position. This strong deactivation of the ortho positions makes the para position electronically much more favored for attack compared to alkyl-substituted rings. Consequently, halobenzenes like chlorobenzene are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than that from toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Para % for -CโHโ < Para % for -Cl\n    *   This gives the relative order: **5 < 3**\n\nCombining the ranking for the ortho,para-directors, we get:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Sequence**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups:\n{Ranking of meta-directors} < {Ranking of ortho,para-directors}\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the substances:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position of electrophilic attack (in this case, by Br+). They are classified as either *ortho, para*-directors or *meta*-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating), with the exception of halogens which are deactivating.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors by Para-Isomer Yield\nSubstances with *meta*-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the *para*-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely proportional to the deactivating (and thus meta-directing) strength of the substituent. The stronger the deactivating group, the more selective it is for the *meta* position, and the less *para*-isomer will be formed.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is generally accepted as:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the yield of the *para*-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nYield(C6H5-NO2) < Yield(C6H5-COOH) < Yield(C6H5-COOC2H5)\n\nUsing the numbers for the substances, this gives us the beginning of our sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors by Para-Isomer Yield\nSubstances with *ortho, para*-directing groups will produce a high percentage of the *para*-isomer. The exact percentage depends on a balance of electronic and steric effects. The *para* position is generally favored over the *ortho* position to minimize steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   The -CH3 group (in 1) and -C2H5 group (in 5) are both alkyl groups that are *ortho, para*-directing.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance around the *ortho* positions makes the *para* position even more favorable for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the percentage yield of the *para*-isomer for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n    *   This gives us the relationship: Yield(1) < Yield(5).\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) is also an *ortho, para*-director. While it deactivates the ring overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), it directs *ortho, para* because its lone pairs can participate in resonance (+M).\n    *   The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the *ortho* positions more significantly than the *para* position. This electronic factor leads to a very high selectivity for the *para* isomer in halobenzenes.\n    *   Experimental data shows that bromination of toluene (1) yields about 66% *para*-isomer, while bromination of chlorobenzene (3) yields about 87% *para*-isomer. So, Yield(1) < Yield(3).\n    *   The final comparison is between ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). This is a contest between the steric effect of the ethyl group and the electronic effect of the chloro group. Depending on reaction conditions, the values can vary. However, a common line of reasoning in such problems is to consider the electronic effect of the halogen to be extremely effective at promoting para substitution. If we follow the logic that leads to one of the provided answers, the high para-selectivity of chlorobenzene places it at the top. This implies the ordering: Yield(1) < Yield(5) < Yield(3).\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n1.  We established the order for the *meta*-directors (lowest para yield): **4 < 6 < 2**.\n2.  We established the order for the *ortho, para*-directors (highest para yield): **1 < 5 < 3**.\n3.  Combining these two sequences, we get the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the *para*-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring determines where the new bromine atom will attach (the regioselectivity) and how fast the reaction will be (the reactivity).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Examples are alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5).\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These are halogens (-Cl). They withdraw electron density through induction (deactivating the ring) but donate electron density through resonance, which stabilizes the intermediate for ortho and para attack.\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Examples are -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5.\n\nThe question asks to order the substances by the increasing yield of the **para-isomer**.\n\n**2. Classify the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify the given substances based on their substituent's directing effect:\n\n*   **Substances that will give a high yield of para-isomer (ortho-, para-directors):**\n    1)  C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    3)  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    5)  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n*   **Substances that will give a very low yield of para-isomer (meta-directors):**\n    2)  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    4)  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    6)  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\nThis means the overall order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho-, para-directors).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the vast majority of the product is the meta-isomer. The small amounts of ortho and para isomers formed are inversely related to the electron-withdrawing (deactivating) strength of the substituent. The stronger the deactivating group, the lower the yield of ortho and para products.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least amount of para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator, but less so than -NO2. It will produce a very small amount of para-isomer (for nitration, ~2%).\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is the weakest deactivator in this group. It will produce a small amount of para-isomer, but more than the other two (for nitration, ~6%).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho-, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is significant. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by two main factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The specific electronic nature of the group influences the relative stability of the intermediates for ortho and para attack.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **C6H5-CH3 (1, Toluene):** The methyl group is small. Bromination gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. Literature values for bromination show approximately **67% para-isomer**.\n*   **C6H5-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is larger (bulkier) than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. Literature values indicate approximately **90-94% para-isomer**.\n*   **C6H5-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is a deactivating o,p-director. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position, leading to high para-selectivity. Literature values for bromination show approximately **87% para-isomer**.\n\nBased on these values, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nToluene (67%) < Chlorobenzene (87%) < Ethylbenzene (90-94%)\nSo, the order is **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**5. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors all have a much lower para-yield than the ortho-, para-directors.\n\nCombined order: (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\nFinal order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**6. Compare with Provided Options**\n\nLet's examine the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOur derived order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5) does not perfectly match any of the options. This suggests a possible error in the question's options or a reliance on slightly different data.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options to find the best fit.\n*   **Option C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   The order for the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n    *   The order for the ortho-, para-directors is given as 1 < 5 < 3. This means Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This contradicts our data showing Chlorobenzene (87%) < Ethylbenzene (~90%).\n\n*   **Option D: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n    *   The order for the meta-directors (4 < 2 < 6) is incorrect. The para yield for COOH (6) is lower than for COOC2H5 (2).\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for the meta-directors and the resulting para-yield is a very standard and reliable principle in organic chemistry. Option C is the only one that correctly orders this part (4 < 6 < 2). The relative ordering of the ortho-, para-directors can be subject to subtle effects and varying literature data, although the order 1 < 3 < 5 seems more supported. Given the choices, Option C is the most plausible answer as it correctly identifies the two main classes and correctly orders the members of the meta-directing class. The discrepancy is likely due to the specific data source used for the question.\n\nTherefore, we select the option that is most consistent with fundamental chemical principles.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (`C6H5-X`) determines the position of the incoming bromine. We need to order the substances based on the yield of the para-product.\n\nSubstituents are classified as:\n*   **Activating groups (o,p-directors):** They donate electrons to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the *ortho* and *para* positions. Examples in our list: `-CH3` (1), `-C2H5` (5).\n*   **Deactivating groups (o,p-directors):** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electrons via induction (deactivating) but donate via resonance (o,p-directing). Example: `-Cl` (3).\n*   **Deactivating groups (m-directors):** They withdraw electrons from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. Examples: `-NO2` (4), `-COOH` (6), `-COOC2H5` (2).\n\n**2. Analyze Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The three m-directors are:\n*   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n*   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n*   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nTo rank these three, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, and consequently, a lower yield of the para (and ortho) isomers.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOR` (ester).\n*   However, electrophilic bromination typically requires a Lewis acid catalyst (like FeBr3). Esters (`-COOC2H5`) can act as Lewis bases and coordinate with the catalyst through the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms. This coordination makes the ester substituent significantly more electron-withdrawing and thus more deactivating. It's plausible that the complexed ester becomes a stronger deactivating group than the carboxylic acid.\n*   Let's assume this interaction occurs. The deactivating strength order becomes: `-NO2` > `-COOC2H5` (complexed) > `-COOH`.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the reverse of the deactivating strength: `-NO2` < `-COOC2H5` < `-COOH`.\n*   This translates to the numerical order: `4 < 2 < 6`.\n\n**3. Analyze Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with o,p-directing groups will have high yields of the para-isomer. The three o,p-directors are:\n*   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n*   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n*   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n\nFor these groups, the distribution between the ortho and para positions is mainly determined by **steric hindrance**. A larger, bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position.\n\n*   Let's rank the substituents by their steric bulk: `-Cl` < `-CH3` < `-C2H5`.\n    *   Chlorine is a single atom.\n    *   Methyl (`-CH3`) is bulkier than a chlorine atom.\n    *   Ethyl (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than methyl.\n*   A higher steric bulk leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: `C6H5-Cl` < `C6H5-CH3` < `C6H5-C2H5`.\n*   This translates to the numerical order: `3 < 1 < 5`.\n\n**4. Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked lists. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: `4 < 2 < 6`\n*   Ortho, para-director order: `3 < 1 < 5`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n`4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5`\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires arranging several substituted benzenes in order of increasing yield of the para-bromo derivative during an electrophilic substitution reaction. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. We need to classify the substituents and then analyze the factors that influence the ortho/para ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is a **deactivating, ortho, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is a strongly **deactivating, meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing substituents**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer. The amount of para product is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivator directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in less para product.\n\nThe deactivating strength of the meta-directors is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group because the ethyl group is weakly electron-donating compared to the acidic proton of the -COOH group.\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5\nIn terms of substance numbers, this is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho, para-directing substituents**\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 and -C2H5 (1 and 5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the para/ortho ratio between them is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position.\n    Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    Order: C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5\n    In terms of numbers: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing -Cl with the alkyl groups (3 vs. 1 and 5):** The chloro group is an o,p-director but is deactivating overall. Halogens have a unique effect: their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates all ring positions, but the effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions. Their electron-donating resonance effect (+R) activates the ortho and para positions. The combination of these effects leads to a strong preference for para substitution over ortho substitution. Consequently, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon halogenation, typically higher than that from simple alkylbenzenes.\n    Thus, the para yield for chlorobenzene is higher than for ethylbenzene and toluene.\n    Order: C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n    In terms of numbers: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining the ordering for all ortho, para-directors:\nC6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\nIn terms of numbers: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine all substances**\n\nThe meta-directing groups produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer, followed by the ortho, para-directing groups. We combine the two ordered lists from the previous steps.\n\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "**Detailed Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer after electrophilic bromination. Since the monobrominated products for each starting material are isomers, they have the same molar mass. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield. We are essentially ranking the compounds by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThe six compounds are:\n1) ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by their Directing Effects**\n\nThe position of electrophilic substitution is determined by the substituent already on the benzene ring. We must classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) -NO2 (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (Ester group):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH3 (Methyl group):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (Ethyl group):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chloro group):** Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, and the three ortho, para-directors will have the highest. The final order must be of the form: **{compounds 2, 4, 6} < {compounds 1, 3, 5}**. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which do not follow this pattern. We are left with options B and C.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in a lower percentage of the para-product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n**-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\nThe nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is stronger than the ester because the alkyl group of the ester provides a slight electron-donating inductive effect, which slightly mitigates the overall deactivating nature compared to the acidic proton of the -COOH group.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nYield(-NO2) < Yield(-COOH) < Yield(-COOC2H5)\nIn terms of substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\nLet's compare this to our remaining options:\n*   **B) 4<6<2<1<5<3**: The first part, `4 < 6 < 2`, matches our finding.\n*   **C) 4<2<6<3<1<5**: The first part, `4 < 2 < 6`, is incorrect.\n\nThis step alone strongly indicates that **B** is the correct answer.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3) to Confirm**\n\nThis ranking depends on the para/ortho product ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para yield than toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. They are deactivating but o,p-directing. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates all positions, but the effect is strongest at the ortho position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, makes the para position highly favored. The para yield for chlorobenzene is very high (around 89%), which is significantly higher than for ethylbenzene (which is itself higher than toluene).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para yield is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\nOrder: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final Order**\n\nCombining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3:\n*   Meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\nThe final combined order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The weight fraction of the yield is equivalent to the mole fraction (or mole percent) of the para-isomer in the product mixture, as all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given starting material have the same molar mass.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. This property determines the primary positions of electrophilic attack.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (like alkyls) or halogens.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Methyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chloro): Deactivating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethyl): Activating, ortho,para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups, typically containing a partial or full positive charge on the atom attached to the ring (e.g., due to a double or triple bond to a more electronegative atom).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl carboxylate): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the Groups based on Directing Effect**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho,para-directing groups will produce significant amounts. Therefore, the three meta-directing compounds will have the lowest para-yields.\n\nThe order will be: {compounds 2, 4, 6} < {compounds 1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds (4, 6, 2)**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. The stronger the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position, the lower the yield of the ortho and para isomers will be.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\nThis gives the beginning of our sequence as: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho,Para-Directing Compounds (1, 3, 5)**\nFor ortho,para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. The para position is generally favored over the ortho position due to less steric hindrance. This effect is more pronounced for larger substituents.\n\n*   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1)**\n*   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5)**\n*   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3)**\n\nThe steric hindrance of the substituent increases in the order: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5.\nA simple steric argument would suggest that the preference for the para position, and thus the para-yield, should increase in the same order: Cl < CH3 < C2H5, which corresponds to `3 < 1 < 5`.\n\nHowever, electronic effects are also important. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position, which also increases para selectivity. Experimental data for bromination shows the following approximate para-isomer yields:\n*   Toluene (1): ~67%\n*   Chlorobenzene (3): ~87%\n*   Ethylbenzene (5): ~94%\n\nSo, the correct experimental order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5). This corresponds to the sequence `1 < 3 < 5`.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Orders and Select the Best Option**\nCombining the order of the two groups:\n*   From meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   From ortho,para-directors (using experimental data): `1 < 3 < 5`\n\nThe full, chemically correct order is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5`.\n\nNow let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nNone of the options perfectly matches our derived order `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5`. This indicates a likely error in the question or options. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on our most certain conclusions:\n1.  The order for meta-directors `4 < 6 < 2` is based on fundamental principles of electronic effects.\n2.  Only **Option A** starts with this correct sequence: `4<6<2...`.\n\nLet's examine the rest of Option A: `...1<5<3`. This implies the para-yield order for o,p-directors is Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This contradicts our experimental data, which shows Ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than Chlorobenzene (`...1<3<5`).\n\nHowever, the error in the other options is more significant. For example, Option D suggests the order `4<2<6...`, which incorrectly states that ethyl benzoate gives less para-product than benzoic acid.\n\nGiven the choices, Option A is the most plausible answer because it correctly orders the meta-directing groups, which is a key part of the problem based on well-established chemical principles. The error in the latter part of the sequence is likely a flaw in the question's construction.\n\nFinal derived order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** (as per Option A)\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the *increasing* percentage yield of the para-brominated product.\n\nThe substances are:\n1) ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is the key factor that determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. Substituents can be classified as either:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyls) or weakly deactivating groups (like halogens).\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves. They are typically deactivating groups.\n\nLet's classify each substituent:\n*   **1) -CH3 (methyl group):** An alkyl group. It is activating and **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **2) -COOC2H5 (ester group):** An electron-withdrawing group. It is deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **3) -Cl (chloro group):** A halogen. It is deactivating but **ortho, para-directing** due to its lone pairs.\n*   **4) -NO2 (nitro group):** A strongly electron-withdrawing group. It is strongly deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **5) -C2H5 (ethyl group):** An alkyl group. It is activating and **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid group):** An electron-withdrawing group. It is deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Meta-Directing Group**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yields of the ortho and para isomers will be very low.\nThe meta-directors are: -NO2 (4), -COOH (6), and -COOC2H5 (2).\n\nTo rank them by their para-isomer yield, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to a higher selectivity for the meta position, and thus a lower yield of the minor para product.\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is stronger than the ester group because the alkyl group in the ester is weakly electron-donating, slightly reducing the deactivating effect of the carbonyl.)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three substances is the reverse of their deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of both ortho and para isomers. The para-isomer is usually favored, especially when steric hindrance at the ortho positions is significant.\nThe ortho, para-directors are: -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3).\n\nTo rank them, we need to consider the para/ortho ratio, which is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. The electrophile in bromination (Br+, or more accurately the Br2-Lewis acid complex) is relatively large, making steric effects important.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 and -C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para product than toluene.\n    *   Order: C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5)\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl:** The chloro group is a single atom, but it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect which deactivates the ring, particularly at the ortho positions. This electronic effect reinforces the steric preference for the para position. Experimental data for bromination shows that chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 89%), which is higher than that for toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Rankings**\n\nThe meta-directing group will always produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than the ortho, para-directing group. So, we can combine the two ranked lists.\n\n*   Lowest para yields (meta-directors): 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Highest para yields (ortho, para-directors): 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining these gives the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-X) as either activating or deactivating, and determine its directing effect (ortho, para-directing or meta-directing).\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):**\n    *   Substituent: -CH3 (methyl)\n    *   Classification: Activating group (donates electron density via induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director**.\n\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):**\n    *   Substituent: -COOC2H5 (ester)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (withdraws electron density via resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -Cl (chloro)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (strong inductive withdrawal outweighs weak resonance donation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director** (due to resonance).\n\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   Classification: Strongly deactivating group (withdraws electron density via induction and resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):**\n    *   Substituent: -C2H5 (ethyl)\n    *   Classification: Activating group (donates electron density via induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Ortho, para-director**.\n\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):**\n    *   Substituent: -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n    *   Classification: Deactivating group (withdraws electron density via resonance).\n    *   Directing Effect: **Meta-director**.\n\n### Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely related to the strength of the deactivating (and thus meta-directing) effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe meta-directing substances are:\n*   4) C6H5-NO2\n*   6) C6H5-COOH\n*   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n\nThe general order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the group that deactivates the most (-NO2) will yield the least para-isomer, and the group that deactivates the least among these three (-COOC2H5) will yield the most (though still a very small amount).\n\nThe order of increasing para-isomer yield for this subset is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends on steric and electronic factors.\n\nThe ortho, para-directing substances are:\n*   1) C6H5-CH3\n*   5) C6H5-C2H5\n*   3) C6H5-Cl\n\nLet's compare them:\n\n*   **1 (-CH3) vs. 5 (-C2H5):** Both are alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile (Br+) at the nearby ortho positions more effectively, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Consequently, ethylbenzene will have a higher para/ortho ratio and a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director, but it is deactivating. Its directing effect is governed by a balance of a strong, distance-dependent inductive withdrawal (-I effect) and a resonance donation (+R effect). The -I effect deactivates all positions, but it is strongest at the ortho positions and weakest at the para position. This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position over the ortho position, leading to a very high para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (around 89% in bromination). This yield is typically higher than that for toluene (~67%). The trend of increasing para yield with alkyl group size (CH3 < C2H5 < t-butyl) shows that for t-butylbenzene, the para yield is about 84%. It is reasonable to assume the para yield for ethylbenzene will be between that of toluene (67%) and t-butylbenzene (84%), and therefore less than that of chlorobenzene (89%).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Orders\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors (4, 6, 2) produce extremely low yields of the para-isomer (typically <5%), while the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) produce high yields (typically >60%). Therefore, all meta-directors will come before all ortho, para-directors in the final ranking.\n\nCombining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This property determines the primary positions where the incoming bromine atom will attach.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating. The yield of the para-isomer from these substances will be very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the general order.**\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-isomer compared to ortho,para-directors, the substances with meta-directing groups will come first in the sequence (lowest yield), followed by the substances with ortho,para-directing groups.\n\nThe order will look like: {meta-directors} < {ortho,para-directors}.\nSo, {4, 2, 6} < {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6).**\nThe question asks for the order of *increasing* yield of the para-isomer. For meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is minimal, but we can still rank them. The ranking depends on how strongly each group directs to the meta position. A stronger meta-director will result in a lower yield of any ortho or para products. The strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect for these groups is generally accepted as:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nThis means the -NO2 group is the most effective at directing to the meta position, and thus will produce the *least* amount of para-isomer. The -COOC2H5 group is the least effective meta-director among the three, so it will produce the *most* para-isomer (although still a very small amount).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\n\n**Step 4: Rank the substances with ortho,para-directing groups (1, 5, 3).**\nFor these substances, we need to consider the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho product. The main factor is steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. As a result, substitution at the less hindered para position is favored. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Considering -Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating, they are ortho,para-directors. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the chlorine atom deactivates the entire ring, but it deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with some steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for substitution at the para position. The yield of the para-isomer for the bromination of chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the rankings into the final order.**\nNow we combine the rankings from Step 2, 3, and 4.\n\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the factors influencing product distribution.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (C6H5-) determines the position of the incoming bromine atom. This is known as the directing effect. The question asks for the weight fraction of the para-isomer. Since all possible monobrominated products (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material are isomers, they have the same molar mass. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is equal to its mole fraction or percentage yield.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nWe need to classify each substituent as either activating (and ortho, para-directing) or deactivating (and meta-directing or ortho, para-directing).\n\n*   **Group A: Meta-directing deactivators.** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n*   **Group B: Ortho, para-directors.** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating, ortho, para-directing.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances in Group A will have the lowest para-yields, and the substances in Group B will have the highest para-yields. So, the final order will look like {Group A substances} < {Group B substances}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within Group A (meta-directors).**\nFor meta-directing groups, a stronger deactivating effect leads to a higher proportion of the meta-isomer and, consequently, a lower proportion of the para-isomer. The order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5\nUsing the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\nApproximate para-yields from literature confirm this: Nitrobenzene (~0.3%), Benzoic acid (~2%), Ethyl benzoate (~4%).\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within Group B (ortho, para-directors).**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on a balance of electronic effects and steric hindrance. The para position is generally favored to avoid steric clash with the existing substituent.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is significantly bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes para-substitution much more favorable for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Yield: p-bromotoluene ~67%.\n    *   Yield: p-bromoethylbenzene ~94%.\n    *   Therefore, the order is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive effect (-I), but it directs ortho/para due to its resonance effect (+R). The -I effect is strongest at the ortho position, which deactivates it more than the para position. This results in a high preference for para substitution.\n    *   Yield: p-bromotoluene ~67%.\n    *   Yield: p-bromochlorobenzene ~87%.\n    *   Therefore, the order is: **1 < 3**.\n\n*   **Comparing Chlorobenzene (3) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both substituents lead to a high para-yield. The steric effect of the bulky ethyl group in (5) is slightly more dominant in favoring the para position than the electronic effect in chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   Yield: p-bromochlorobenzene ~87%.\n    *   Yield: p-bromoethylbenzene ~94%.\n    *   Therefore, the order is: **3 < 5**.\n\nCombining the results for Group B, we get the order of increasing para-yield:\nToluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5)\nThe order is: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the ordered groups.**\nWe combine the order from Group A and Group B to get the final overall order:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\nFinal order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare the derived order with the given options.**\n*   Our derived order: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Incorrect)\n*   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Incorrect, but very close)\n*   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect)\n*   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect)\n\nLet's analyze option B: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\nThis option correctly orders the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2). It also correctly identifies that the meta-directors have lower para-yields than the ortho, para-directors. It correctly identifies toluene (1) as having the lowest para-yield among the o,p-directors. The only discrepancy is the order of the last two substances, ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). Option B states 5 < 3, while our data shows 3 < 5 (87% < 94%).\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question, and option B is correct in almost all aspects, differing only by a single pairwise comparison at the end, it is the most plausible answer. It is highly likely that there is a typographical error in the option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on substituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the given substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-bromo isomer. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the mole fraction (percentage yield) of the para-isomer, as all monobromo-isomers of a given substance have the same molar mass.\n\nThe substances are:\n1)  C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2)  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3)  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4)  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5)  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6)  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This effect determines where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   -CH3 (Toluene) and -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Alkyl groups are weakly activating and o,p-directing.\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Halogens are deactivating but o,p-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating and m-directing.\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid): Moderately deactivating and m-directing.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Moderately deactivating and m-directing.\n\n**3. General Yield Comparison**\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups** yield ortho and para isomers as the major products. The yield of the para-isomer is substantial (typically >30%).\n*   **Meta-directing groups** yield the meta isomer as the major product. The yields of ortho and para isomers are very low (typically <5-10%).\n\nTherefore, any substance with an o,p-directing group will produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer than any substance with an m-directing group. This allows us to split the list into two parts:\nLow para yield: (Nitrobenzene, Benzoic acid, Ethyl benzoate)\nHigh para yield: (Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Chlorobenzene)\n\n**4. Ordering within the Meta-Directing Group (Low Para Yield)**\n\nThe substances are Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), and Ethyl benzoate (2). All are m-directors. The question asks for the yield of the para-isomer, which is a minor product for these compounds. The amount of the minor (ortho/para) products formed is inversely related to how strongly the substituent deactivates the ring. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   **-NO2:** Very strong deactivating effect (strong -I inductive effect and -R resonance effect).\n*   **-COOH:** Strong deactivating effect (-I and -R effects).\n*   **-COOC2H5:** Strong deactivating effect (-I and -R effects). The alkyl group (-C2H5) has a slight electron-donating (+I) effect, which makes the -COOC2H5 group slightly less deactivating than the -COOH group.\n\nSo, the order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**5. Ordering within the Ortho-, Para-Directing Group (High Para Yield)**\n\nThe substances are Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3). For these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho isomers. The formation of the para-isomer is generally favored over the ortho-isomer due to steric hindrance from the substituent.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3) vs. Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the attack at the para position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While chlorine is less bulky than a methyl group, it has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I). This effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the more distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that bromination of chlorobenzene yields nearly 90% para-isomer, which is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (~76%).\n    *   Order: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**6. Final Overall Ordering**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered lists. The group of m-directors comes first (lowest para yield), followed by the group of o,p-directors (highest para yield).\n\n*   Order of m-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of o,p-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Question**\n\nThe question asks to arrange six monosubstituted benzene compounds in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** formed during electrophilic bromination.\n\nThe compounds are:\n1.  **Toluene (C6H5-CH3):** -CH3 is an alkyl group.\n2.  **Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group.\n3.  **Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl):** -Cl is a halogen.\n4.  **Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2):** -NO2 is a nitro group.\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group.\n6.  **Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe ortho-, meta-, and para-isomers of a specific brominated compound (e.g., bromotoluene) all have the same molecular formula and thus the same molecular weight. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (or percentage yield). The question is equivalent to arranging the compounds by the increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to specific positions.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   `-CH3` (Toluene, 1)\n    *   `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating) but can donate electron density via resonance (ortho-, para-directing).\n    *   `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, especially from the ortho and para positions, making the meta position the most favorable for attack. These will produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene, 4) - Strongly deactivating\n    *   `-COOH` (Benzoic acid, 6) - Deactivating\n    *   `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate, 2) - Deactivating\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Compounds (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nThe compounds with meta-directing groups (4, 6, and 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ortho/para positions and directs meta.\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** This is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It directs almost exclusively to the meta position, resulting in a negligible amount of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6):** This is also a strong deactivating group, but generally considered less deactivating than the nitro group. It will produce a very small amount of para-isomer, but slightly more than nitrobenzene (typically 1-2%).\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2):** The ester group is also deactivating and meta-directing, with a strength comparable to the carboxylic acid group, but often considered slightly weaker. It will produce more para-isomer than both nitrobenzene and benzoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho-, Para-Directing Compounds (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nThe compounds with ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, and 3) will have high yields of the para-isomer. The order among them depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **-Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although the -Cl group deactivates the ring, it strongly favors the para position over the ortho position for substitution. This is because its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is most felt at the closer ortho positions, disfavoring attack there relative to the more distant para position. Thus, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 89%). This will be the highest in the entire set.\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The main difference affecting the para/ortho ratio is sterics. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. As a result, substitution at the less hindered para position becomes more favorable for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   *Conclusion based on sterics*: para% (Toluene) < para% (Ethylbenzene).\n    *   This gives the order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\nCombining the ortho-, para-directors, we get the order of increasing para yield:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Orders and Select the Answer**\n\nNow, combine the two groups. The meta-directors have very low para yields, and the ortho-, para-directors have high para yields.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Ortho-, para-directors order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining these two sequences gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nNow, we match this order with the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe derived order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the question.**\nThe reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of six different substituted benzene compounds. We need to arrange these compounds in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*. The weight fraction of an isomer is directly proportional to its mole fraction (percentage yield), as all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material have the same molar mass. Therefore, we need to rank the compounds based on the percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their effect on the reaction rate (activating/deactivating) and the position of substitution (directing effect).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (in Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing group:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density via induction (deactivating) but direct to ortho and para positions via resonance.\n    *   3) -Cl (in Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   4) -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) -COOH (in Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for each group.**\n\n*   **Meta-directors (compounds 4, 2, 6):** These substances will yield the meta-isomer as the major product. The yields of ortho- and para-isomers will be very low. To rank them, we consider that a stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield will be the reverse of this: C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\n    *   Approximate para-yields: Nitrobenzene (~0.1%), Benzoic acid (~1-2%), Ethyl benzoate (~2-3%).\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors (compounds 1, 5, 3):** These substances will yield significant amounts of both ortho- and para-isomers. The ratio between the ortho and para products is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent on the ring will block the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the sterically accessible para position.\n    *   Let's compare the sizes of the substituents: -C2H5 is significantly bulkier than -CH3. The -Cl atom is similar in size to the -CH3 group.\n    *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** The methyl group offers some steric hindrance. Bromination yields about 67% para-isomer.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The bulkier ethyl group provides much more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer, about 94%.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** The chloro group's size and strong inductive deactivation at the ortho position favor para substitution. The para-isomer yield is high, about 89%.\n    *   Comparing the percentage yields: 67% (Toluene) < 89% (Chlorobenzene) < 94% (Ethylbenzene).\n    *   So, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Step 4: Combine the groups and determine the final order.**\nThe meta-directors (4, 6, 2) will have much lower para-yields than the ortho-, para-directors (1, 3, 5). Combining the orders from Step 3 gives the complete sequence:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the derived order with the given options.**\nThe theoretically correct order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5.\nLet's check the options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect.\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4<6<2) and correctly identifies toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para-yield. However, it incorrectly swaps the positions of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3), stating that the para yield of (5) is less than (3) (94% < 89% is false).\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect. It gets the order of meta-directors wrong (2<6) and o,p-directors wrong (3<1).\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect. It gets the order of meta-directors wrong and o,p-directors wrong (5<1).\n\nAmong the given choices, option B has the most correct elements. It correctly groups and orders the meta-directors and correctly places toluene relative to the other o,p-directors. The only error is the inversion of the last two compounds. In the context of a multiple-choice question with a likely error in the options, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of a series of monosubstituted benzenes. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the increasing yield of the para-monobromo derivative. The weight fraction of the yield is directly related to the molar percentage yield, as the molar masses of the products are reasonably similar. Therefore, we can focus on ordering by the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents\nThe directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring is crucial. We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating group (+I effect, hyperconjugation). Ortho, para-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating group (+I effect, hyperconjugation). Ortho, para-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating group (-I effect > +M effect) but is an ortho, para-director due to resonance (+M effect) stabilizing the intermediate carbocation.\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)**: Deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating group (-I, -M effects). Meta-director.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Grouping\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will form very little para-isomer, while those with ortho, para-directing groups will form a significant amount of the para-isomer. Therefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing substances first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\nOrder: (Group of 2, 4, 6) < (Group of 1, 3, 5)\n\n### Step 4: Rank the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)\nFor meta-directors, the main product is the meta-isomer. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts. The selectivity for the meta position increases with the electron-withdrawing (deactivating) strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a lower yield of the disfavored para and ortho isomers.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the group that is most strongly deactivated (-NO2) will produce the least amount of para-isomer. The order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n### Step 5: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)\nFor these substances, both ortho and para isomers are major products. The ratio between them (and thus the percentage yield of the para-isomer) depends on a combination of electronic and steric effects. The incoming electrophile is a bromine atom, which is relatively large, so steric hindrance is an important factor.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the product being the para-isomer. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5)**: The chloro group is a special case. It deactivates the ring through its strong inductive effect (-I), but directs ortho/para via its resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor strongly disfavors ortho substitution, leading to a very high selectivity for the para position. Experimental data confirms that the para/ortho ratio for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Approximate para-yields in bromination: Toluene (~67%), Ethylbenzene (~70%), Chlorobenzene (~88%).\n\nBased on this, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nC6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Rankings\nNow, we combine the rankings from the two groups:\n\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires us to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction. The regioselectivity (ortho, meta, or para) of this reaction is governed by the nature of the substituent already present on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the substituents\nWe first need to classify each substituent as either activating or deactivating, and as an ortho/para-director or a meta-director.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **1) -CH3 (methyl):** Activating.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (ethyl):** Activating.\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-directing groups:** Halogens are a special case. They withdraw electron density via induction (deactivating) but donate via resonance, making them ortho/para directors.\n    *   **3) -Cl (chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho/para-directing.\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer for these substances will be very low.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester):** Deactivating.\n    *   **4) -NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) -COOH (carboxylic acid):** Deactivating.\n\n### Step 2: Separate the substances into two main groups\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups:\n*   **Group A (Low para yield):** The meta-directors will produce very little para-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **Group B (High para yield):** The ortho/para-directors will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have substances from Group A first, followed by substances from Group B.\n\n### Step 3: Order the substances within Group A (meta-directors)\nWe need to arrange substances 2, 4, and 6 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. For meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to more selective meta-substitution, and thus an even lower yield of the minor ortho and para products.\nThe order of deactivating strength is generally:\n-NOโ > -COOH > -COOCโHโ\nThis means the -NOโ group is the strongest meta-director, leading to the lowest para yield. The -COOCโHโ group is the weakest deactivator in this set, leading to the highest para yield among the three.\nSo, the order of *increasing* para yield is:\n**4 (-NOโ) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOCโHโ)**\n\n### Step 4: Order the substances within Group B (ortho/para-directors)\nWe need to arrange substances 1, 3, and 5 in order of increasing para-isomer yield. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by sterics and electronics.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CHโ) and 5 (-CโHโ):** The ethyl group (-CโHโ) is larger (sterically bulkier) than the methyl group (-CHโ). This increased bulk hinders the attack of the electrophile at the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, thus increasing the relative yield of the para-isomer. So, the para yield for ethylbenzene will be higher than for toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** Halogens, like chlorine, are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, their strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho positions more than the para position. This, combined with sterics, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data confirms that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a significantly higher percentage of the para-isomer (~87%) compared to toluene (~62%) and ethylbenzene (~68%).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### Step 5: Combine the ordered groups\nNow we combine the order from Step 3 and Step 4. The substances in Group A have a much lower para yield than those in Group B.\n\nCombining (4 < 6 < 2) and (1 < 5 < 3), we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic substitution (bromination). The substituent on the benzene ring determines where the incoming electrophile (Brโบ) will add. We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho,para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They generally result in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CHโ (Methyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   **5) -CโHโ (Ethyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho,para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very small, almost negligible, amounts of the ortho and para isomers.\n    *   **4) -NOโ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **2) -COOCโHโ (Ethyl ester):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\nFrom this classification, we know that substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer, while substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest yield. The final sequence will look like this: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}.\n\n**2. Rank the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The amount of para product formed is inversely related to the strength of the group's deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will \"enforce\" meta-direction more strongly, leading to an even smaller percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established:\n-NOโ > -COOH > -COOCโHโ\n(Nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid, which is slightly stronger than an ester).\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\nYield for -NOโ < Yield for -COOH < Yield for -COOCโHโ\n\nThis gives us the order for the first part of the sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**3. Rank the Ortho,Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho,para-directors, the proportion of the para-isomer depends on a balance of steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CHโ (1) and -CโHโ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The main difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-CโHโ) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CHโ). This bulkiness hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Para % for -CHโ < Para % for -CโHโ\n    *   This gives the relative order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups with -Cl (3):** Chlorine is a halogen. Halogens have a unique combination of effects: they are deactivating due to a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but they are ortho,para-directing due to an electron-donating resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect is strongest at the closest positions (ortho) and weaker at the more distant para position. This strong deactivation of the ortho positions makes the para position electronically much more favored for attack compared to alkyl-substituted rings. Consequently, halobenzenes like chlorobenzene are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than that from toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Para % for -CโHโ < Para % for -Cl\n    *   This gives the relative order: **5 < 3**\n\nCombining the ranking for the ortho,para-directors, we get:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Sequence**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups:\n{Ranking of meta-directors} < {Ranking of ortho,para-directors}\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the substances:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position of electrophilic attack (in this case, by Br+). They are classified as either *ortho, para*-directors or *meta*-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating), with the exception of halogens which are deactivating.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating).\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors by Para-Isomer Yield\nSubstances with *meta*-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the *para*-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely proportional to the deactivating (and thus meta-directing) strength of the substituent. The stronger the deactivating group, the more selective it is for the *meta* position, and the less *para*-isomer will be formed.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is generally accepted as:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the yield of the *para*-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nYield(C6H5-NO2) < Yield(C6H5-COOH) < Yield(C6H5-COOC2H5)\n\nUsing the numbers for the substances, this gives us the beginning of our sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors by Para-Isomer Yield\nSubstances with *ortho, para*-directing groups will produce a high percentage of the *para*-isomer. The exact percentage depends on a balance of electronic and steric effects. The *para* position is generally favored over the *ortho* position to minimize steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   The -CH3 group (in 1) and -C2H5 group (in 5) are both alkyl groups that are *ortho, para*-directing.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance around the *ortho* positions makes the *para* position even more favorable for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the percentage yield of the *para*-isomer for ethylbenzene is greater than for toluene.\n    *   This gives us the relationship: Yield(1) < Yield(5).\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) is also an *ortho, para*-director. While it deactivates the ring overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), it directs *ortho, para* because its lone pairs can participate in resonance (+M).\n    *   The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the *ortho* positions more significantly than the *para* position. This electronic factor leads to a very high selectivity for the *para* isomer in halobenzenes.\n    *   Experimental data shows that bromination of toluene (1) yields about 66% *para*-isomer, while bromination of chlorobenzene (3) yields about 87% *para*-isomer. So, Yield(1) < Yield(3).\n    *   The final comparison is between ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). This is a contest between the steric effect of the ethyl group and the electronic effect of the chloro group. Depending on reaction conditions, the values can vary. However, a common line of reasoning in such problems is to consider the electronic effect of the halogen to be extremely effective at promoting para substitution. If we follow the logic that leads to one of the provided answers, the high para-selectivity of chlorobenzene places it at the top. This implies the ordering: Yield(1) < Yield(5) < Yield(3).\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n1.  We established the order for the *meta*-directors (lowest para yield): **4 < 6 < 2**.\n2.  We established the order for the *ortho, para*-directors (highest para yield): **1 < 5 < 3**.\n3.  Combining these two sequences, we get the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the *para*-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring determines where the new bromine atom will attach (the regioselectivity) and how fast the reaction will be (the reactivity).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Examples are alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5).\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These are halogens (-Cl). They withdraw electron density through induction (deactivating the ring) but donate electron density through resonance, which stabilizes the intermediate for ortho and para attack.\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Examples are -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5.\n\nThe question asks to order the substances by the increasing yield of the **para-isomer**.\n\n**2. Classify the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify the given substances based on their substituent's directing effect:\n\n*   **Substances that will give a high yield of para-isomer (ortho-, para-directors):**\n    1)  C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n    3)  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    5)  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n*   **Substances that will give a very low yield of para-isomer (meta-directors):**\n    2)  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    4)  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    6)  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\nThis means the overall order will be (meta-directors) < (ortho-, para-directors).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the vast majority of the product is the meta-isomer. The small amounts of ortho and para isomers formed are inversely related to the electron-withdrawing (deactivating) strength of the substituent. The stronger the deactivating group, the lower the yield of ortho and para products.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least amount of para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator, but less so than -NO2. It will produce a very small amount of para-isomer (for nitration, ~2%).\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is the weakest deactivator in this group. It will produce a small amount of para-isomer, but more than the other two (for nitration, ~6%).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho-, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho-, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is significant. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by two main factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The specific electronic nature of the group influences the relative stability of the intermediates for ortho and para attack.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **C6H5-CH3 (1, Toluene):** The methyl group is small. Bromination gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. Literature values for bromination show approximately **67% para-isomer**.\n*   **C6H5-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is larger (bulkier) than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. Literature values indicate approximately **90-94% para-isomer**.\n*   **C6H5-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom is a deactivating o,p-director. The strong inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position, leading to high para-selectivity. Literature values for bromination show approximately **87% para-isomer**.\n\nBased on these values, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nToluene (67%) < Chlorobenzene (87%) < Ethylbenzene (90-94%)\nSo, the order is **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n**5. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors all have a much lower para-yield than the ortho-, para-directors.\n\nCombined order: (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 3 < 5)\nFinal order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**6. Compare with Provided Options**\n\nLet's examine the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOur derived order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5) does not perfectly match any of the options. This suggests a possible error in the question's options or a reliance on slightly different data.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options to find the best fit.\n*   **Option C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   The order for the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) is correct.\n    *   The order for the ortho-, para-directors is given as 1 < 5 < 3. This means Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. This contradicts our data showing Chlorobenzene (87%) < Ethylbenzene (~90%).\n\n*   **Option D: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n    *   The order for the meta-directors (4 < 2 < 6) is incorrect. The para yield for COOH (6) is lower than for COOC2H5 (2).\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for the meta-directors and the resulting para-yield is a very standard and reliable principle in organic chemistry. Option C is the only one that correctly orders this part (4 < 6 < 2). The relative ordering of the ortho-, para-directors can be subject to subtle effects and varying literature data, although the order 1 < 3 < 5 seems more supported. Given the choices, Option C is the most plausible answer as it correctly identifies the two main classes and correctly orders the members of the meta-directing class. The discrepancy is likely due to the specific data source used for the question.\n\nTherefore, we select the option that is most consistent with fundamental chemical principles.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (`C6H5-X`) determines the position of the incoming bromine. We need to order the substances based on the yield of the para-product.\n\nSubstituents are classified as:\n*   **Activating groups (o,p-directors):** They donate electrons to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the *ortho* and *para* positions. Examples in our list: `-CH3` (1), `-C2H5` (5).\n*   **Deactivating groups (o,p-directors):** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electrons via induction (deactivating) but donate via resonance (o,p-directing). Example: `-Cl` (3).\n*   **Deactivating groups (m-directors):** They withdraw electrons from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. Examples: `-NO2` (4), `-COOH` (6), `-COOC2H5` (2).\n\n**2. Analyze Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The three m-directors are:\n*   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n*   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n*   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nTo rank these three, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, and consequently, a lower yield of the para (and ortho) isomers.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOR` (ester).\n*   However, electrophilic bromination typically requires a Lewis acid catalyst (like FeBr3). Esters (`-COOC2H5`) can act as Lewis bases and coordinate with the catalyst through the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms. This coordination makes the ester substituent significantly more electron-withdrawing and thus more deactivating. It's plausible that the complexed ester becomes a stronger deactivating group than the carboxylic acid.\n*   Let's assume this interaction occurs. The deactivating strength order becomes: `-NO2` > `-COOC2H5` (complexed) > `-COOH`.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the reverse of the deactivating strength: `-NO2` < `-COOC2H5` < `-COOH`.\n*   This translates to the numerical order: `4 < 2 < 6`.\n\n**3. Analyze Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with o,p-directing groups will have high yields of the para-isomer. The three o,p-directors are:\n*   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n*   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n*   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n\nFor these groups, the distribution between the ortho and para positions is mainly determined by **steric hindrance**. A larger, bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position.\n\n*   Let's rank the substituents by their steric bulk: `-Cl` < `-CH3` < `-C2H5`.\n    *   Chlorine is a single atom.\n    *   Methyl (`-CH3`) is bulkier than a chlorine atom.\n    *   Ethyl (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than methyl.\n*   A higher steric bulk leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: `C6H5-Cl` < `C6H5-CH3` < `C6H5-C2H5`.\n*   This translates to the numerical order: `3 < 1 < 5`.\n\n**4. Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked lists. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: `4 < 2 < 6`\n*   Ortho, para-director order: `3 < 1 < 5`\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n`4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5`\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires arranging several substituted benzenes in order of increasing yield of the para-bromo derivative during an electrophilic substitution reaction. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. We need to classify the substituents and then analyze the factors that influence the ortho/para ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is a **deactivating, ortho, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is a strongly **deactivating, meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing substituents**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer. The amount of para product is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivator directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in less para product.\n\nThe deactivating strength of the meta-directors is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group because the ethyl group is weakly electron-donating compared to the acidic proton of the -COOH group.\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5\nIn terms of substance numbers, this is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho, para-directing substituents**\n\nThe substances with ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 and -C2H5 (1 and 5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor determining the para/ortho ratio between them is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position.\n    Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    Order: C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5\n    In terms of numbers: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing -Cl with the alkyl groups (3 vs. 1 and 5):** The chloro group is an o,p-director but is deactivating overall. Halogens have a unique effect: their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates all ring positions, but the effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions. Their electron-donating resonance effect (+R) activates the ortho and para positions. The combination of these effects leads to a strong preference for para substitution over ortho substitution. Consequently, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon halogenation, typically higher than that from simple alkylbenzenes.\n    Thus, the para yield for chlorobenzene is higher than for ethylbenzene and toluene.\n    Order: C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n    In terms of numbers: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining the ordering for all ortho, para-directors:\nC6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\nIn terms of numbers: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine all substances**\n\nThe meta-directing groups produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer, followed by the ortho, para-directing groups. We combine the two ordered lists from the previous steps.\n\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
