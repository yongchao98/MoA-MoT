We must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities. The formula for the relative velocity (`v_rel`) of an object moving at velocity `v1` as seen from a reference frame moving at velocity `v2` (both in the same direction) is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 * c^2) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7) * c`\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857 c`\n\nLooking at the options, `0.14c` is the closest value.\n\n**4. Part B: Calculating the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the equation `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = (γ1 * m1 * c^2) + (γ2 * m2 * c^2)`\n\n**Step 4.1: Calculate the energy of Astronaut 1 (E1)**\n*   `m1 = 2m`\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n\nFirst, find `γ1`:\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n`γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n`γ1 = 1.25`\n\nNow, calculate `E1`:\n`E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n`E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n`E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Step 4.2: Calculate the energy of Astronaut 2 (E2)**\n*   `m2 = 3m`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nFirst, find `γ2`:\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n`γ2 = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3)`\n`γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n\nNow, calculate `E2`:\n`E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n`E2 = (2 / sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c^2`\n`E2 = (6 / sqrt(3)) * mc^2`\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by `sqrt(3)`:\n`E2 = (6 * sqrt(3) / 3) * mc^2`\n`E2 = 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2`\nUsing the approximation `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`:\n`E2 ≈ 2 * 1.732 * mc^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Step 4.3: Calculate the total energy (E_total)**\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2`\n`E_total = (2.5 + 2 * sqrt(3)) * mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) * mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ 5.964 mc^2`\n\nLooking at the options, `5.96 mc^2` is the value for total energy.\n\n**5.
