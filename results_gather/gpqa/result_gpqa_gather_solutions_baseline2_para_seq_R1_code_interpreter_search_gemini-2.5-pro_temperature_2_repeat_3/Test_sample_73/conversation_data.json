The key principle is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic properties or its future decay probability. Therefore, we can ignore the first 50 minutes and simply calculate the probability of a fresh atom decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\n2.  **Define the Decay Law**\n    The probability `P(t)` that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant, a characteristic of the specific atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom *does* decay within time `t` is:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).

This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The \"clock\" effectively resets at every moment.

Therefore, the question can be simplified to: \"What is the probability that this type of atom decays in a 150-minute period?\"\n\n**Step 1: Define the Decay Law**\nThe probability that an atom decays within a time `t` is given by `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\nWe are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n\nP(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval**\nWe want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found:\nP(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)\nP(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)\nUsing the log rule `a*ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\nP(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\nP(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\nThe calculation `1 - 0.68^1.5` yields approximately `0.4393`.\nThe probability as a percentage is `0.4393 * 100 = 43.93%`.\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis is correct. Let's provide a final, definitive summary of the reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** From the given information, the probability that the atom *decays* within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the probability that it *survives* for 100 minutes is `1 - 0.32 = 0.68`. This survival probability `S(100)` is given by the formula `S(100) = e^(-λ*100) = 0.68`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Memoryless Property:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, which is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of the atom decaying in the future is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability.\n\n3.  **The Question:** Therefore, the question simplifies from \"What is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given 50 minutes of survival?\" to the much simpler \"What is the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval?\".\n\n4.  **Calculation:** We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150)`. We can find `S(150)` by using the value we already know:\n    *   `S(150) = e^(-λ*150) = (e^(-λ*100))^1.5 = (S(100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value `S(100) = 0.68`, we get `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   The probability of decay is `1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n5.  **Result:** The code correctly computes this value:\n    `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.4393`\n    This corresponds to a probability of **43.93%**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated probability is 43.93%.

The probability of survival over a time t is P_survive(t) = e^(-λt). The probability of decay is P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n3.  We are given P_decay(100) = 0.32. This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is P_survive(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n4.  So, e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n5.  We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n6.

We just need to calculate the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 1: Define the decay probability formula.**\nThe probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is given by:\n`P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n**Step 2: Use the given information to find the value of `e^(-λ*100)`.**\nWe are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this equation, we can determine the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n`e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.**\nBecause the process is memoryless, this is the same as calculating `P_decay(150)`.\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nWe can rewrite the exponential term using the value we found in Step 2:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value `0.68` into the equation:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**Step 4: Compute the final probability.**\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe calculation performed by the code gives:\n`1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result to the given options.**\nA) 48%\nB) 44%\nC) 52%\nD) 40%\n\nThe calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nMy reasoning for the initial solution was as follows:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability that an atom survives for a time `t` is given by `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability that it decays within time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use Given Information:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   Rearranging this gives us the survival probability: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`. This is a key value we can use.\n\n3.  **Address the Question:** We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Radioactive decay is a *memoryless* process. This is a fundamental concept, meaning the probability of decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. Therefore, the fact that it survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to the calculation for the next 150 minutes. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:** We need to calculate `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can use a mathematical trick to solve this without explicitly finding `λ`. We can rewrite the exponent:\n        `-λ * 150 = (-λ * 100) * 1.5`\n    *   So, `e^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`.\n    *   From step 2, we know `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Substituting this value in, we get `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Executing this calculation: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n    *   As a percentage, this is approximately 43.93%.\n\nBased on your execution of the code which yielded `43.9257...%`, we can confirm this result.\n\nThe value 43.93% is closest to the multiple-choice option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
