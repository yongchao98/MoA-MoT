    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy of the system is conserved. The total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$). The rest mass energy ($mc^2$) is also part of the particle's total energy. We can write the total energy of the system as:\n    $E_{total} = \\text{Total Relativistic Energy of the mass} + \\text{Potential Energy}$\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the object.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $v$ is the speed of the object.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    So, the conservation of energy equation is:\n    $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Identify the states of the oscillator**\n    We need to compare the energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n    *   **State 1: At maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At this point, the position is $x = A$, and the mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   **State 2: At the equilibrium position.**\n        At this point, the position is $x = 0$, and the potential energy is zero. All the energy is kinetic, so the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total energy at each state**\n    *   **Energy at State 1 ($x = A$, $v = 0$):**\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E_1 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - 0}} + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Energy at State 2 ($x = 0$, $v = v_{max}$):**\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E_2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$**\n    By the principle of conservation of energy, $E_1 = E_2$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Next, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n    This result matches option D.\n\nAs a check, we can see what happens in the non-relativistic limit (when the potential energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy, i.e., $\\frac{kA^2}{2} \\ll mc^2$). In this case, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ is very small. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$, we get $(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = 1 - \\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}$.\nThen, $v_{max} \\approx c\\sqrt{1 - (1 - \\frac{kA^2}{mc^2})} = c\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$. This is the classical result obtained from $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, which confirms our relativistic formula is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
