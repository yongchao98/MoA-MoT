    "This problem requires us to find the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, $P_2 / P_1$, given the wavelength shifts they induce in their host stars' spectra.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. A change in the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$) causes a shift in the observed wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) of its spectral lines. The relationship is given by:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem states the shift is measured for the *same spectral line*, so $\\lambda_0$ is constant. This means the observed radial velocity is directly proportional to the wavelength shift: $v_r \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$.\n\n    The problem gives the *periodic shift up to* a certain value. This maximum shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted by $K$. Therefore:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n    For the two systems:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms. So, $K_1 \\propto 5$.\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms. So, $K_2 \\propto 7$.\n\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    The RV amplitude $K$ for a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane). The term $m_p \\sin i$ is what's actually measured, often called the \"minimum mass\".\n\n3.  **Establish the Proportionality:**\n    We are given the following information about the two systems:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n    *   For a simple physics problem of this nature, we can assume the orbital inclinations are the same, or at least that the measured minimum mass term ($m_p \\sin i$) is the same for both systems.\n\n    Given that $G$, $m_p$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin i$ are the same for both systems, we can see from the formula that the RV amplitude $K$ is proportional to the inverse cube root of the period $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Periods:**\n    We can write the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We know $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$. So:\n    $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. First, let's solve for $\\frac{P_1}{P_2}$ by cubing both sides:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^3 = \\frac{343}{125}$\n\n    Now, we can find the desired ratio by taking the reciprocal:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To get the decimal value, we can perform the division.\n```python\n# Calculate the final numerical answer\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.3644314868285521\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of light from a star. The amount of wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight, $v_r$. The maximum periodic shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n\n    Given the wavelength shifts for the two planets:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms. So, the RV amplitude $K_1$ is proportional to 5.\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms. So, the RV amplitude $K_2$ is proportional to 7.\n\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n2.  **Relating RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    (assuming the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$).\n\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    *   Since the systems are analogous, it is reasonable to assume the orbital inclinations ($i$) are similar.\n\n    With $m_p$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin i$ being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality between $K$ and the orbital period $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Calculating the Ratio of Periods:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute the known ratio of the amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, first cube both sides:\n    $\\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    $\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. So we take the reciprocal:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
