    "This question asks to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry from a given list. To do this, we need to determine the point group of each molecule. A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has a C3 principal axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it, but lacks other symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes that would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h or C3v.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (D)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead, linked by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: There is a C3 rotation axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the carbon of the opposing CH group. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis and pass through the middle of each ethylene bridge. There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group.\n\n2.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the systematic name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three cyclic anhydride groups [-C(=O)O-C(=O)-] at the 1,2-, 3,4-, and 5,6- positions. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   Crucially, it also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, each passing through the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central benzene ring.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (B)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule is analogous to mellitic trianhydride, but with a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene ring. It is also planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: Similar to mellitic trianhydride, it has a C3 principal axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, a σh horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane), and three C2 axes lying in the plane.\n    *   **Point Group**: Like the previous molecule, its point group is **D3h**.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (C)**:\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-i-Pr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. The boron atom is sp2 hybridized, leading to a planar or near-planar BO3 core.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. This is due to the three identical isopropyl borate groups arranged around the central boron.\n        *   To have a σh plane, the three isopropyl groups must be oriented symmetrically with respect to the BO3 plane. An idealized conformation can be drawn where the BO3 atoms and the three secondary carbons of the isopropyl groups all lie in the σh plane. For each isopropyl group, the H atom on the secondary carbon would also lie in this plane, while the two methyl groups would be positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane. This conformation possesses a σh plane.\n        *   The molecule lacks the perpendicular C2 axes required for D3h symmetry and the vertical mirror planes required for C3v symmetry.\n    *   **Point Group**: In this idealized, symmetric conformation, the molecule's point group is **C3h**. While the actual ground-state structure might be slightly twisted due to steric hindrance (reducing the symmetry to C3), in the context of typical symmetry problems, the idealized high-symmetry structure is considered.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: D3h\n*   Molecule C: C3h (in an idealized conformation)\n*   Molecule D: C3v\n\nA molecule is assigned to the highest symmetry point group that describes all its symmetry elements. While D3h molecules contain the symmetry elements of C3h, their point group is D3h. Quinuclidine is C3v. Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule from the list whose point group is C3h.\n\n<<<C>>>"
