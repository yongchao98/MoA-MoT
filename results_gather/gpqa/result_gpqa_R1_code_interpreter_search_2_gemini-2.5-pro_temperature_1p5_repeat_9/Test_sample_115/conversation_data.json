    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A from the Proton NMR Data**\n\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum of Compound A shows two signals:\n    *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet means the adjacent carbon has 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). The 6H integration suggests two equivalent methyl groups (2 x -CH₃).\n    *   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet means the adjacent carbon has 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). The 4H integration suggests two equivalent methylene groups (2 x -CH₂).\n*   Putting this together, the data describes two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The question is, what connects these two ethyl groups? For the ethyl groups to be perfectly equivalent, they must be attached to a central atom or group that has no protons and a plane of symmetry.\n*   The most common structure that fits this is pentan-3-one (CH₃CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃). The carbonyl group (C=O) has no protons and makes the two ethyl groups equivalent. The chemical shifts are also reasonably consistent with this structure (α-protons to a carbonyl are deshielded).\n*   However, as we will see, this structure leads to a contradiction later in the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence and deduce the structure of Compound C**\n\n*   **A → B:** Compound A undergoes monobromination to form B.\n*   **B → C:** Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. The problem states that C has *two geometrical isomers* (i.e., cis and trans isomers). This is a crucial piece of information. C must be an alkene of the type R₁-CH=CH-R₂.\n*   **C + Diene → D:** The *cis-isomer of C* reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol in a Diels-Alder reaction to produce Compound D.\n*   The options for Compound D are all **trimethylcyclohex-2-enols**. A Diels-Alder reaction forms a cyclohexene ring. The diene, (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH₃), provides one methyl group (-CH₃) and one hydroxyl group (-OH) to the final product.\n*   For the final product D to have *three* methyl groups, the dienophile (Compound C) must provide the other *two* methyl groups.\n*   A dienophile that is an alkene, has two methyl groups, and exists as cis/trans isomers can only be **but-2-ene** (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Reconcile the structure of C with the structure of A**\n\n*   If Compound C is but-2-ene, it must be formed by the elimination of HBr from Compound B using alcoholic KOH. This implies that Compound B is **2-bromobutane**.\n*   If Compound B is 2-bromobutane, it must be formed by the monobromination of Compound A. This implies that Compound A is **butane** (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n*   Now we have a contradiction. The NMR data for A points to pentan-3-one, but the reaction products point to A being butane. Let's check the NMR of butane: it has two signals, a triplet (6H) for the -CH₃ groups and a **sextet** (4H) for the -CH₂- groups (since each -CH₂- is coupled to 3+2=5 protons). The question incorrectly states the CH₂ signal is a quartet. Given that the rest of the intricate reaction sequence and stereochemistry can be solved if A is butane, we must assume the \"quartet\" description in the problem is an error for \"sextet/multiplet\". This is the most logical way to proceed.\n\n**Step 4: The Diels-Alder Reaction to form Compound D**\n\n*   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene.\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The product is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n*   We need to determine the stereochemistry:\n    1.  **Concerted reaction:** The stereochemistry of the reactants is preserved in the product.\n    2.  From the *cis*-dienophile: The two methyl groups (at future C5 and C6) will be *cis* to each other in the cyclohexene ring.\n    3.  From the (E,E)-diene: The substituents on the ends of the diene (the -OH at C1 and -CH₃ at C4) will be *trans* to each other in the product.\n    4.  **Endo rule:** For determining the final relative stereochemistry, we consider the transition state. The \"endo\" approach is favored. Let's assume an approach that gives one of the enantiomers listed in the options.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the R/S configuration of the product**\n\n*   Let's assume the diene is approached from the 'top' and the dienophile substituents are oriented to give the product matching an option. The isomer that results from a standard endo approach is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol (this assumes a specific orientation of approach for one of the two possible enantiomeric products).\n    *   **C1:** The -OH group has a specific orientation.\n    *   **C4:** The -CH₃ group is *trans* to the C1 -OH group.\n    *   **C5 & C6:** The two -CH₃ groups are *cis* to each other.\n*   Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities for this specific stereoisomer gives the configuration **(1S,4R,5S,6R)**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
