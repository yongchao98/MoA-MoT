    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the Structure of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n    *   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region show a classic A₂B₂ splitting pattern. This pattern, with two doublets each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicates a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the more upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is split by both the adjacent methyl group and the methine group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the aromatic ring and is also bonded to the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Combining these pieces, the structure is `Aryl-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The combination of red phosphorus and concentrated HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of various functional groups, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and most notably, carboxylic acids, all the way down to the corresponding alkane.\n    *   **Transformation:** In this reaction, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH at position 1 is converted to -CH₃. The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains. The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n\n    *   The predicted product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   This matches option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
