    "To determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to check if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is a good indicator of chirality. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond, and the atoms directly attached to the double bond lie in the same plane. The overall molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral**. It will not exhibit optical activity.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes absolute stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A molecule designated with specific R/S configurations is a single enantiomer or diastereomer, which is chiral unless it is a special case like a meso compound.\n    *   Given the complexity of the bridged bicyclic structure, it is extremely unlikely to have the internal symmetry required to be a meso compound. The specified configuration `(3aR,7aS)` refers to a specific non-superimposable mirror image form.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as `(2R,3S)`. Since the groups on C2 (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`) are the same as the groups on C3, we should check for internal symmetry.\n    *   If we draw the molecule (e.g., in a Fischer projection), we can see a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        H ---C--- CH3\n        ------|------  <- Plane of symmetry\n      CH3 ---C--- H\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   This is a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are **achiral** due to internal symmetry, despite having stereocenters. They are not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The configuration is `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This isomer lacks an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and the two are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   Since `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair, it is **chiral** and will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, which bears the -OH group, is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. Because the double bond is asymmetrically located with respect to C1, the two ring paths are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active. Therefore, this compound is **chiral**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation suggests a specific relative stereochemistry, most plausibly the all-cis isomer.\n    *   In the all-cis isomer, all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring. This molecule has high symmetry. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the C4 carbon atom.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and not optically active. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral centers.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Based on IUPAC nomenclature for ketones, the structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` (isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone).\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents).\n    *   In the `(CH3)2CH-` group, the CH carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center.\n    *   All other carbons are either part of a `CH2` group, a `C=O` group, or an unsubstituted cyclopentyl ring. None of them are chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule as a whole does not have overall chirality. It is **achiral** and will not be optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Not optically active (achiral) compounds:\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (meso)\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
