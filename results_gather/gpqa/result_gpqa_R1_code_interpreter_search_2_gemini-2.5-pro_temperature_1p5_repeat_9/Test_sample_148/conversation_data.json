    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Observations:**\n    *   **Observation 1 (¹H NMR):** We see two distinct peaks for what should be a single proton (an alpha-proton).\n        *   The peaks have similar chemical shifts. This suggests the proton is in two very similar, but not identical, chemical environments.\n        *   The integrals are roughly equal, and their sum corresponds to one proton. This indicates there's a nearly 1:1 mixture of two different species, and in each species, that alpha-proton is present.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting is not due to neighboring protons. This reinforces the idea of two distinct molecular species.\n\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):**\n        *   We see two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. This means the crude material contains two compounds that can be separated based on their different physical/chemical properties (like polarity, which affects their interaction with the LC column).\n        *   The peaks have equal intensities, which corroborates the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   Crucially, both peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass matches the expected product. This tells us the two compounds are *isomers*—they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but different arrangements of atoms.\n        *   The analysis is done at an \"elevated temperature.\" This is a key clue. It suggests that the two species don't easily interconvert. If they were rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers with a low energy barrier), a higher temperature would likely cause them to coalesce into a single, possibly broadened, peak in both the NMR and the LC. Seeing two sharp peaks at elevated temperature suggests a significant energy barrier between the two isomeric forms.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations (the Options):**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This means an extra amino acid was accidentally added. For example, instead of synthesizing A-B, you get A-A-B. This would result in a molecule with a significantly different (higher) molecular weight, which contradicts the MS data showing the *expected* mass for both peaks.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Therefore, they would *not* separate on a standard LC column (they would elute as a single peak).\n        *   They would also give *identical* ¹H NMR spectra (producing only one set of peaks).\n        *   This option directly contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the isomers differ in the configuration at some, but not all, of these centers.\n        *   **Crucially, diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.**\n        *   This means they **can be separated by standard chromatography (LC)**, which explains the two LC peaks.\n        *   Because their atoms are arranged differently in 3D space, they have **different NMR spectra**. A given proton (like an alpha-proton) will be in a slightly different chemical environment in each diastereoisomer, leading to two distinct NMR peaks. This explains the two alpha-proton signals.\n        *   By definition, diastereoisomers are isomers, so they have the same molecular formula and **the same mass**, which explains the MS data.\n        *   **How could this happen in a peptide?** Two common ways:\n            1.  **Epimerization:** One of the chiral centers (the alpha-carbon of an amino acid) might have partially inverted its stereochemistry during synthesis, leading to a mix of, for example, an L-L dipeptide and an L-D dipeptide. These are diastereomers. A 1:1 mixture suggests one of the starting amino acids might have been used as a racemic (D/L) mixture.\n            2.  **Cis/Trans Isomerism:** The amide (peptide) bond has restricted rotation. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are a form of diastereomer, and they can be stable enough to be observed as separate species in NMR and separated by LC, especially in peptides containing proline.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of two separable isomers with the same mass, each giving a distinct NMR signal, is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is the only option that fits all the provided experimental evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
