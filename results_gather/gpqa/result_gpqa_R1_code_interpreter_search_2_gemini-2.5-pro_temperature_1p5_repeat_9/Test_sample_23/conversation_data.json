    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n*   Mass fraction of H = 14.28% = 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n*   Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n    Mass % H = (y × Ar(H)) / (x × Ar(C) + y × Ar(H))\n    Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12:\n    1/7 = y / (12x + y)\n    12x + y = 7y\n    12x = 6y\n    y = 2x\n*   The empirical formula is CH2. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n.\n*   Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\", which means it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   Hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n can be either alkenes or cycloalkanes. Since Z is saturated, it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   The problem states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Furthermore, hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* one substance, Z. This strongly suggests that all components of X and Y share the same carbon skeleton, which is that of Z. The stability of a six-membered ring makes cyclohexane a very likely candidate for Z. Let's assume **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)** and verify this choice as we proceed.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y is formed from X, and it \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This implies that its components are saturated or otherwise unreactive towards bromine water (like aromatic compounds).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call it Y1.\n    Y1 = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y1 (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane. This is consistent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of the second component, Y2, must also give cyclohexane.\n*   So, Y2 must have a C6 carbon skeleton. But Y2 does not decolorize bromine water. An aromatic ring like benzene fits this description perfectly: it does not react with bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure and/or temperature with a catalyst).\n*   So, let's propose that **Y2 is benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   This means **Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}**.\n*   This mixture is equimolar, consists of two liquids, and does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of the mixture (cyclohexane + benzene) yields only one product, cyclohexane (Z). This model fits all the given information about Y and Z.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning at least one (and likely both) of its components contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both X1 and X2 have a C6 ring carbon skeleton.\n*   Mixture X reacts on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y. The reaction is described as a disproportionation. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction must be:\n    X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. For the reaction to be balanced, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides.\n    *   Total C atoms on the right = 6 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 12.\n    *   Total H atoms on the right = 12 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 18.\n*   Since X is an equimolar mixture of X1 and X2, and they both have a C6 skeleton, their formulas must be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n    *   Total C atoms on the left = 6 + 6 = 12. (Matches)\n    *   Total H atoms on the left = a + b = 18.\n*   In the disproportionation reaction, one component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane (C6H12), and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene (C6H6). The simplest and most logical process is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's assume X1 is reduced and X2 is oxidized.\n    *   X1 → C6H12 (Reduction)\n    *   X2 → C6H6 (Oxidation)\n*   The most common unsaturated C6 ring precursors are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Let's see if these fit.\n    *   If **X1 is cyclohexene (C6H10)**, it gets hydrogenated to C6H12.\n    *   If **X2 is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**, it gets dehydrogenated to C6H6.\n*   Let's check if the hydrogen count matches: a = 10, b = 8. Total H = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n*   The final constraint is that \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (which is conjugated) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (which is not conjugated). The condition requires that X2 must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n*   Therefore, Mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in X1 (cyclohexene, C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in X2 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
