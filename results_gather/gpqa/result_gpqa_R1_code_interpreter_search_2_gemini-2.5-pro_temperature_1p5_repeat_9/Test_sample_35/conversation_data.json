The relationship between distance, Hubble's constant, and recessional velocity is given by Hubble's Law: `v = H₀ * D`. The redshift `z` is the ratio of the recessional velocity to the speed of light `c` (for z < 1).\n    *   Convert distance from Gpc to Mpc: `D = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc`.\n    *   Calculate recessional velocity: `v = 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s`.\n    *   Calculate redshift: `z = v / c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)**: The observed energy (`E_obs`) is lower than the emitted energy (`E_rest`) due to the expansion of the universe. The relationship is `E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`.\n    *   `E_rest = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * (1 + 0.49) = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * 1.49 = 5.811 * 10^-6 eV`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Transition**: We need to determine what physical process in the interstellar medium corresponds to an energy of about `5.811 * 10^-6 eV`.\n    *   This energy is characteristic of the hyperfine transition of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I). This transition occurs when the spin of the electron flips relative to the spin of the proton.\n    *   The energy difference corresponds to a photon with a frequency of 1420 MHz and a wavelength of approximately 21 cm. The energy of this 21 cm line is very close to our calculated value: `E = hf ≈ (4.136 * 10^-15 eV·s) * (1420 * 10^6 s⁻¹) ≈ 5.87 * 10^-6 eV`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Medium**: The 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is the primary way astronomers detect and map the **atomic interstellar medium**. While neutral hydrogen exists in both warm and cold phases, sharp absorption lines like the one described are specifically tracers of the **Cold Neutral Medium (CNM)**, also known as the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated rest-frame energy corresponds to the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen, which is the hallmark of the cold atomic interstellar medium. Therefore, the same absorption line observed in the Milky Way would signify the presence of this medium.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Cold atomic interstellar medium. (Correct)\n*   B) Cold molecular interstellar medium. (Incorrect, this is traced by molecules like CO)\n*   C) Warm molecular interstellar medium. (Incorrect)\n*   D) Warm atomic interstellar medium. (Incorrect, absorption features are much broader than emission features from the WNM)\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks what a specific astronomical observation corresponds to if it were observed locally in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The observation is of an absorption line from a very distant object. Because the object is distant, its light is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. To identify the source of the absorption line, we must first calculate its energy in the rest-frame (i.e., correct for the redshift).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):**\n    *   The relationship between a distant object's recessional velocity (`v`), its distance (`D`), and the Hubble constant (`H₀`) is given by Hubble's Law: `v = H₀ × D`.\n    *   The redshift `z` is the ratio of this velocity to the speed of light `c` (for `v << c`, `z ≈ v/c`).\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Distance `D = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc`\n        *   Hubble Constant `H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc` (a standard approximate value)\n        *   Speed of light `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   `v = 70 km/s/Mpc × 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s`\n        *   `z = v / c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49`\n    *   The code execution confirms this calculation with higher precision, yielding `z ≈ 0.49`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):**\n    *   The observed energy (`E_obs`) is related to the emitted (rest-frame) energy (`E_rest`) by the formula: `E_rest = E_obs × (1 + z)`.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Observed energy `E_obs = 3.9 × 10⁻⁶ eV`\n        *   Calculated redshift `z ≈ 0.49`\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   `E_rest = (3.9 × 10⁻⁶ eV) × (1 + 0.49) = (3.9 × 10⁻⁶ eV) × 1.49 ≈ 5.81 × 10⁻⁶ eV`\n    *   The code execution confirms this calculation, giving a result of `E_rest = 5.812 × 10⁻⁶ eV`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Physical Process:**\n    *   Now we need to find what transition in the interstellar medium has an energy of approximately `5.8 × 10⁻⁶ eV`.\n    *   This energy is famously associated with the **21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I)**. This is a hyperfine transition that occurs when the spin of the electron flips relative to the spin of the proton.\n    *   Let's verify the energy of the 21 cm line. It has a frequency of 1420.4 MHz and a wavelength of ~21.1 cm. Using `E = hf`, where `h = 4.136 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s`, we get `E ≈ 5.87 × 10⁻⁶ eV`.\n    *   The calculated rest-frame energy (`5.812 × 10⁻⁶ eV`) is an excellent match for the energy of the 21 cm hydrogen line (`5.875 × 10⁻⁶ eV`). The small difference is well within the uncertainty of the value used for the Hubble constant.\n\n5.  **Identify the Medium:**\n    *   The 21 cm line is the signature of atomic hydrogen. The interstellar medium contains both a warm atomic phase and a cold atomic phase.\n    *   **Absorption lines**, such as the one detected, are produced when cool gas lies in front of a hotter, background source of radiation. The cool gas absorbs photons at its specific transition energy.\n    *   The **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium** (also called the Cold Neutral Medium, or CNM) is typically around 50-100 Kelvin. It is dense enough and cold enough to produce sharp, strong 21 cm absorption lines.\n    *   The Warm Atomic Interstellar Medium (WNM) is much hotter (~8000 K) and less dense. Due to the high temperature, the absorption lines it produces are very broad and shallow, making them difficult to detect. It is primarily observed through its faint, broad emission.\n    *   Therefore, a distinct absorption line at 21 cm is the classic tracer for the **cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The observation is of the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen, seen in absorption. In the Milky Way, this would signify the presence of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
