    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2).\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring structure (1 DBE).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (> 9.5 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3 rule, so n=2). This indicates a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. Given the presence of nitrogen in the formula, this signal corresponds to a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is typical for N-H protons due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet (d) for 2 protons in the aliphatic region. It corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet splitting means it's adjacent to a single proton (n+1=2 rule, so n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, where these CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    The fragments are: a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group.\n    Putting them together gives **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O = C8H9NO. This matches the molecular formula.\n    So, the starting material is 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture generates nitrous acid (HNO2) in situ. It is used for the **diazotization** of primary aromatic amines. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    The intermediate formed is 2-(4-diazoniophenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n    `H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO  --NaNO2, HCl-->  [Cl-][+N2]-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to an aryl diazonium salt and warming (which often happens spontaneously or with slight heating) causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium group, replacing it with a hydroxyl (-OH) group and releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n    `[+N2]-C6H4-CH2-CHO  --H2O-->  HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + N2 + H+`\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, applied to the product from step 2, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. This aldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- group). Aldehydes with α-protons undergo a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation** reaction. The \"Heat\" component is key, as it promotes the dehydration of the initial aldol addition product.\n\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde (an aldol adduct).\n        *   Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat causes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        *   Adduct: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-C6H4-OH`\n        *   Dehydration: `- H2O`\n        *   Final Product: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-C6H4-OH`\n\n*   **Identify the Final Product:**\n    The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration. Let's name it according to IUPAC rules:\n    *   The main chain contains the aldehyde and the double bond. It is a butenal.\n    *   Numbering starts from the aldehyde carbon (C1).\n    *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a `but-2-enal`.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C4.\n    *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure perfectly match option (A). Option (B) is the intermediate aldol adduct before the heat-induced dehydration step. Since heat is specified, the condensation product (A) is the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
