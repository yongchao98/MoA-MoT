    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   The question asks to identify the compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione that does **not** show tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerism**, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (an alpha-hydrogen). An α-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Let's examine Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n        *   These α-carbons are bonded to other carbons in the ring, not to any hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Since benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Let's examine Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are single-bonded (saturated).\n        *   Each of the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 is an α-carbon to two adjacent carbonyl groups (e.g., C2 is alpha to C1 and C3).\n        *   These carbons (C2, C4, C6) are CH₂ groups, so they possess α-hydrogens.\n        *   The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to a very stable aromatic enol form called phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone does not have α-hydrogens and thus does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Therefore, compound **A is benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   The question asks to identify the compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate that **will** show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Let's examine Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group).\n        *   This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   **Let's examine Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   The structure is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbons of the double bond are each bonded to only three groups, so they cannot be chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is relatively planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n        *   Molecules with a center of symmetry are achiral (not chiral).\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral. Therefore, compound **B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Final Combination:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
