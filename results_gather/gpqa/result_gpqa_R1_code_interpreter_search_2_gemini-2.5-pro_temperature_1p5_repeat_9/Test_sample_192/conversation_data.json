    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks how the number of stars per unit distance interval, which we can denote as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:** We are told that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In problems involving distributions, this phrasing typically refers to the number density. So, we interpret this as the number of stars per unit parallax interval, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    Let's write this mathematically:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Relate Distance and Parallax:** The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The standard definition used in astronomy is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    (where parallax is in arcseconds and distance is in parsecs).\n\n4.  **Find the Transformation Factor:** We need to convert a density function from being in terms of parallax to being in terms of distance. This requires finding the relationship between the infinitesimal intervals `d(plx)` and `dr`. We can do this by differentiating the parallax-distance relation with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r²`\n    When we transform the density, we are concerned with the magnitude of this relationship, as the number of stars in a corresponding interval must be positive.\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Apply the Chain Rule (Change of Variables):** The number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) can be related to the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) using the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n    Since we are dealing with densities (which are always positive), we use the absolute value of the Jacobian `|d(plx)/dr|`:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the known proportionalities into this equation.\n    *   We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   We found `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n    So, `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`.\n\n    The final step is to express everything in terms of the desired variable, `r`. We use the relation `plx = 1/r`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻² `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁽⁵⁻²⁾`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as `r³`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
