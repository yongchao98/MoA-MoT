    "This problem can be solved using the energy-time uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The core concept here is the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that it's impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and its exact lifetime simultaneously. The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which corresponds to the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be larger than the combined uncertainty of the levels. A common criterion is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the individual energy uncertainties (linewidths):\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n*   **Calculate Individual Energy Uncertainties (ΔE):** We can calculate the minimum energy uncertainty for each state using its lifetime. For simplicity in order-of-magnitude calculations, we can approximate the formula as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n    *   **Value of ħ:** The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\n    *   The minimum separation needed is the sum of the uncertainties:\n        ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n        ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n        ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        ΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Compare with Options:** We need an energy difference |E1 - E2| that is significantly greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (Too small)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (Too small)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV (Too small, as 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** An energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is the only option large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n**2. Python Code for Calculation:**\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1_s = 1e-9   # Lifetime of state 1 in seconds\ntau2_s = 1e-8   # Lifetime of state 2 in seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using dE * dt ~ h_bar\ndelta_E1_eV = h_bar_eVs / tau1_s\ndelta_E2_eV = h_bar_eVs / tau2_s\n\n# For the levels to be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the linewidths\nmin_energy_difference_eV = delta_E1_eV + delta_E2_eV\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum energy difference required for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {min_energy_difference_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this requirement with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 1e-9 eV\")\nprint(\"B) 1e-11 eV\")\nprint(\"C) 1e-8 eV\")\nprint(\"D) 1e-4 eV\")\n\noptions = {'A': 1e-9, 'B': 1e-11, 'C': 1e-8, 'D': 1e-4}\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference_eV:\n        print(f\"\\nOption {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is significantly larger than the required minimum of {min_energy_difference_eV:.3e} eV and would allow for clear resolution.\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nMinimum energy difference required for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.240e-07 eV\n\nComparing this requirement with the given options:\nA) 1e-9 eV\nB) 1e-11 eV\nC) 1e-8 eV\nD) 1e-4 eV\n\nOption D (1.0e-04 eV) is significantly larger than the required minimum of 7.240e-07 eV and would allow for clear resolution.\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that the required energy separation must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Among the choices provided, only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem uses the energy-time uncertainty principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt) to the inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The principle is given by the relation ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). We can approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Here, Δt represents the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the condition for the energy levels to be clearly resolved:**\n    For two energy levels to be distinguishable, their energy difference must be significantly larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). This is known as the Rayleigh criterion for spectroscopic resolution.\n    *   Required energy difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required energy difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required energy difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required energy difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Compare this minimum required difference with the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is much less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy separation that is large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the combined energy uncertainty.\n\n<<<D>>>"
