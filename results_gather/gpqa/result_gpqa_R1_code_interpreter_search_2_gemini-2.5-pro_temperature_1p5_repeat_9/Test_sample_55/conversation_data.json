    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem asks for the route and probability of a specific decay process for a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Initial State:** `|n=3, l=0, m=0⟩`, which is the 3s state.\n*   **Final State:** `|n=1, l=0, m=0⟩`, which is the 1s state.\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state.\n*   **Goal:** Identify a valid intermediate state and calculate the branching ratio (probability) for the decay path that goes through it.\n\n### 2. Applying E1 Dipole Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   `Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1`\n*   `Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1`\n*   `Δn` is unrestricted.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State(s)\nLet the intermediate state be `|n', l', m'⟩`.\n\n**First Transition: `|3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩`**\n*   `l_initial = 0`. For `Δl = ±1`, the only possibility is `l' = l_initial + 1 = 1`. The state must be a p-orbital.\n*   `m_initial = 0`. For `Δm = 0, ±1`, the possible values for `m'` are `m' = m_initial + Δm`, so `m'` can be -1, 0, or 1.\n*   `n_initial = 3`. The principal quantum number `n'` must be different from 3. Looking at the options provided, the intermediate state has `n'=2`. This is an allowed transition (`3 → 2`).\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`.\n\n**Second Transition: `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`**\nLet's check if the transition from these intermediate states to the final state `|1,0,0⟩` is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   `l_initial = 1`, `l_final = 0`. So `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`, which is allowed.\n*   `m_initial = m'`, `m_final = 0`.\n    *   If `m' = -1`, `Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1` (allowed).\n    *   If `m' = 0`, `Δm = 0 - 0 = 0` (allowed).\n    *   If `m' = 1`, `Δm = 0 - 1 = -1` (allowed).\n*   `n_initial = 2`, `n_final = 1`. `Δn = -1` (allowed).\n\nAll three intermediate states `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩` create valid two-step decay routes.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probabilities (Branching Ratios)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This means we need to find the fraction of decays that follow that particular path. The total process consists of three possible paths, via `m'=-1`, `m'=0`, and `m'=1`.\n\n**Probability ∝ Rate of the path.**\n\nLet's analyze the rate of the first transition: `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`.\n*   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator, `|⟨2,1,m'| \\vec{d} |3,0,0⟩|^2`.\n*   The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` (or 3s) is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred direction in space.\n*   When a spherically symmetric system decays, there is no reason for it to preferentially decay into one `m'` sub-level over another (assuming we average over the polarization of the emitted photon, which is standard).\n*   Therefore, the rates of transition to `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩` must be equal.\n\nLet `Γ₁` be the rate for the transition `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`. Then:\n`Γ₁(-1) = Γ₁(+0) = Γ₁(+1)`\n\nNow, let's analyze the rate of the second transition: `|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n*   In the non-relativistic theory, the energy levels depend only on `n`. The state `|2,1,m'⟩` (2p state) can only decay to the `n=1` level, as the `2s` state (`|2,0,0⟩`) has the same energy, making the transition `2p → 2s` have zero energy change and thus be forbidden for single-photon emission.\n*   Therefore, any atom in any of the `|2,1,m'⟩` states is guaranteed to decay to the `|1,0,0⟩` state. The branching ratio for this step is 1.\n\n**Combining the steps:**\nThe overall rate for a given path through an intermediate state `m'` is determined by the rate of formation of that intermediate state.\nSince the rates of formation `Γ₁(-1)`, `Γ₁(0)`, and `Γ₁(1)` are all equal, the three possible cascade paths are equally probable.\n\nThe three paths are:\n1.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n2.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n3.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n\nSince these are the only three paths considered and they are equally probable, their probabilities must sum to 1.\n`P₁ + P₂ + P₃ = 1`\n`P + P + P = 1`\n`3P = 1`\n`P = 1/3`\n\nSo, each of the three possible transition routes has a probability of `1/3`.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options:\nA) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`. (Probability is incorrect)\nB) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`. (Route is valid, probability is correct)\nC) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`. (Probability is incorrect)\nD) `⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`. (Probability is incorrect)\n\nOption B matches our result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
