    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` near a grounded conducting sphere. \"Grounded\" means the sphere is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The most effective way to solve this type of electrostatics problem is the **Method of Images**.\n\nThis method allows us to replace the complex system of the point charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere with a simpler, equivalent system. The equivalent system consists of the original charge `q` and a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere. This setup perfectly replicates the electric field *outside* the sphere.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge location:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from a reference point at infinity (where U=0) to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this work.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\nThe potential energy `U` is the integral of the force required to move the charge against the electric field of the sphere. The force exerted *by the sphere* on the charge `q` is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   Force on charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance between them)^2`\n    Here, `q'(x) = -qR/x` and the distance is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n*   The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the field from `d` to infinity.\n    `U(d) = W = ∫(d to ∞) F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫(d to ∞) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * ∫(d to ∞) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n*   To solve the integral, use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes `∫ (1/u^2) (du/2) = -1/(2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n*   Evaluating the definite integral:\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `d` to `∞`\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * [ (lim x→∞ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) ]`\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * [ 0 + 1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using the Potential `U = (1/2) qV`\nA more direct method uses the general formula for electrostatic energy `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\n*   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. The sphere has a total induced charge `Q_induced` but its potential `V_sphere` is 0.\n*   The formula becomes: `U = (1/2) * [q * V_induced_at_q + Q_induced * V_sphere]`\n*   Since `V_sphere = 0`, the second term vanishes.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q`\n*   `V_induced_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n*   The distance between the location of `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    `V_induced_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced_at_q = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   Now, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis expression matches option C. The energy is negative because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere, meaning the system has lower potential energy than when the charge is at infinite separation.\n\nLet's check the options provided:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R²)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)          (Incorrect, missing 1/2 and has d instead of R)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)    (**Correct**)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)     (Incorrect, has d instead of R and wrong sign in denominator)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
