    "This is a common colloquialism in synthetic chemistry labs. Let's break down why.\n\n1.  **Context:** In synthetic organic chemistry, a primary challenge after running a reaction is purifying the desired product from any remaining starting materials, byproducts, or solvents.\n2.  **Primary Purification Technique:** The most common and powerful method for purification is **chromatography**, particularly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for quick analysis and column chromatography for large-scale separation.\n3.  **How Chromatography Works:** Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential interaction with a stationary phase (like silica gel, which is very polar) and a mobile phase (a solvent or solvent mixture, typically less polar). A compound's movement is primarily governed by its **polarity**.\n    *   Less polar compounds have weaker interactions with the polar stationary phase and are carried further up the TLC plate by the mobile phase.\n    *   More polar compounds have stronger interactions (like hydrogen bonding) with the stationary phase and move a shorter distance up the plate.\n4.  **\"On Top of Each Other\":** When a chemist runs a TLC, the separated compounds appear as distinct spots. If the desired product and an impurity (e.g., a byproduct or starting material) have very similar polarities, they will travel the same distance on the TLC plate. Their spots will therefore appear at the same position, looking like one big spot or two heavily overlapping spots. This is visually and metaphorically described as the compounds being \"on top of each other.\"\n5.  **Implication:** This observation means that separating the compounds using column chromatography (which operates on the same principle as TLC) will be extremely difficult or impossible under those conditions. The chemist is expressing frustration over this failed or challenging purification.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n*   A) Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is not a basis for standard separation techniques like chromatography.\n*   B) Similar boiling points would be a problem for distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of spots on a TLC plate than of a co-distilling liquid mixture.\n*   **C) Similar polarities are the direct reason why compounds would fail to separate on a standard chromatographic system (TLC or column), leading to the observation that their spots are \"on top of each other.\" This is the most direct and common meaning of the phrase.**\n*   D) While van der Waals forces and other non-covalent interactions are the basis for polarity and intermolecular attraction, the blanket statement that they are \"bonding to each other\" is not the core issue. The problem is not that the compounds are stuck *to each other*, but that they are interacting with the chromatography medium in a nearly identical way due to their similar polarities.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is almost certainly referring to the similar polarities of their compounds, which makes them inseparable by chromatography.\n\n<<<C>>>"
