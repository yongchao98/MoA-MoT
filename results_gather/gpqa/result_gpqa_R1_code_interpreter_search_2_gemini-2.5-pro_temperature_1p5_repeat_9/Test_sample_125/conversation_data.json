    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's identify the structure. It's a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5.\n    *   The carbon at position 5 is a chiral center, and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. The stereochemistry at C5 is fixed as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻ from LAH) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces (top or bottom). This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n    *   The chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the two products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but different arrangements of atoms in space. They have one identical chiral center (5S) and one opposite chiral center (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other are called **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The diketone is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Excess NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:** The reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's list them:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between products:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's examine the (2R, 4S) structure. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (just flip the molecule over). So, they are the same single meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((+)- and (-)-pentane-2,4-diol) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the separation on a normal-phase HPLC column**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and are **not** separable. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different structures and polarities and are separable. The C7 mono-ol/ethers from Reaction I are structurally very different from the C5 diols from Reaction II and will have different retention times.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from it. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the separable species: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso compound from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers. The enantiomers form temporary diastereomeric complexes with the chiral stationary phase, which have different energies and thus different retention times.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:** The mixture contains a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   Since chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers), each of these five compounds will produce a distinct peak.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
