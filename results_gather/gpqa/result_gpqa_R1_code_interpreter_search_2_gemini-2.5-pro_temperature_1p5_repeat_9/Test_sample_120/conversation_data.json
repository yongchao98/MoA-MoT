    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl substituents at C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry of the chiral centers is given.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. This provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Apply the Reaction Rules Provided in the Question:**\n    The question provides two crucial rules for this type of reaction:\n    *   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regiochemistry):**\n    *   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group (as per \"1-trimethyl...\").\n    *   Carbon C6 is part of the bicyclic system and is attached to a hydrogen atom (since it's not stated to have another substituent).\n    *   Comparing the steric hindrance at C1 and C6, C1 is blocked by a methyl group, while C6 is only blocked by a hydrogen atom. A methyl group is significantly larger than a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n    *   According to Rule 1, the nucleophile (Me⁻ from Me₂CuLi) will attack C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6. According to Rule 2, the configuration at this center will be inverted. The starting configuration of C6 is given as (S). Inversion of an (S) center results in an (R) center. So, the carbon atom that was C6 will have an (R) configuration in the product.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is not directly involved in the bond-making/bond-breaking with the nucleophile. The C1-O bond breaks, but this bond breaking happens away from the chiral C1 center itself. The four groups attached to C1 (Me, C2, C6, and O) maintain their relative spatial arrangement. Thus, the configuration at C1 is retained. The starting configuration is (1R), so it remains (R) in the product.\n    *   The chiral centers at C3 and C4 are remote from the reaction site and are unaffected. Their configurations are retained. They start as (3R) and (4R) and will remain (R) in the product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide ring to form a cyclohexanol.\n    *   An -OH group is formed at C1 (from the epoxide oxygen).\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6 (from the cuprate).\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. The methyl groups are at the positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and C6. The hydroxyl group is at the position of the original C1.\n    *   To name the product, we use IUPAC rules. The carbon bearing the -OH group gets the lowest possible number, C1. So, the product's C1 is the reactant's C1.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. We have two ways to number the ring from C1:\n        *   Path A (numbering through old C2): `C1(Me)-C2-C3(Me)-C4(Me)-C5-C6(Me)`. This gives the methyl locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Path B (numbering through old C6): `C1(Me)-C2(Me)-C3-C4(Me)-C5(Me)-C6`. This requires remapping the old carbons to the new numbers: New C2=Old C6, New C4=Old C4, New C5=Old C3. This gives the methyl locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1, 3, 4, 6} and {1, 2, 4, 5}, the latter is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). So, the correct name for the product structure is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n6.  **Assign the Final Stereochemistry:**\n    Now we map the stereochemical changes onto the new IUPAC numbering (Path B):\n    *   **New C1:** Corresponds to Old C1. Configuration was (R) and is retained. -> **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C2:** Corresponds to Old C6. Configuration was (S) and is inverted. -> **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4:** Corresponds to Old C4. Configuration was (R) and is unaffected. -> **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5:** Corresponds to Old C3. Configuration was (R) and is unaffected. -> **(5R)**.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
