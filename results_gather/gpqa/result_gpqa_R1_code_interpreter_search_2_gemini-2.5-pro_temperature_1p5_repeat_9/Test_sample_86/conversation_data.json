    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This points to a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached to it, replacing two hydrogen atoms. The formula for the ring itself is C6H4.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n\n*   We have two substituents: one is a halogen (-X) and the other must contain 2 carbon atoms and a carbonyl group.\n*   Let's identify the possible structure for the second substituent, which has the formula C2HnO. The most common and simple chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This group has two carbons and a carbonyl.\n*   Other possibilities like phenylacetaldehyde (-CH2CHO) also fit the carbon count and carbonyl requirement. We will consider this later.\n\n**3. Propose a Candidate Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   Combining the pieces, a strong candidate for the compound is **haloacetophenone**.\n*   The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). The molecular formula is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, a di-substituted aromatic ring, and an aromatic-halogen bond. It fits all the initial criteria.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Candidate Structure (Haloacetophenone):**\n\n*   **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**: A di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The para-substitution pattern is highly symmetrical.\n*   Let's assume the compound is **para-haloacetophenone** (1-halo-4-acetylbenzene). This is a very common arrangement.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: Due to the symmetry of the para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are equivalent. This typically results in a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (approximately 7.0-8.5 ppm). Each doublet would integrate to 2H, for a total of 4H in the aromatic region. The acetyl group is electron-withdrawing, so the adjacent protons will be shifted downfield.\n    *   **Acetyl Group Protons**: The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). These 3 protons are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will not be split by any neighboring protons and will appear as a **singlet**. This singlet would integrate to 3H and typically appears around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Summary of Predicted Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone**:\n    *   Aromatic region: Two doublets, each for 2H.\n    *   Aliphatic region: One singlet, for 3H.\n    *   Total protons: 4 + 3 = 7H.\n\n**5. Analyze the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H), which contradicts a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4H). The integration is also unusual. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region**: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring, showing two sets of two equivalent protons as doublets. The chemical shifts are downfield, consistent with an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl.\n    *   **Aliphatic region**: 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet for three protons, which is the exact expected signal for a -COCH3 group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This spectrum is a perfect match for our proposed structure of para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This suggests the structure might be para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO), which also fits the C8 count and FTIR data.\n    *   However, if this were the structure, the -CH2- protons (at 3.7 ppm) should be split by the adjacent -CHO proton (appearing as a doublet), and the -CHO proton should be split by the -CH2- protons (appearing as a triplet). The spectrum shows both as singlets, indicating no coupling, which is chemically very unlikely. Therefore, this option is a poor fit.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This directly contradicts the fact that the compound contains an aromatic ring. This is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nOption B is the only choice that perfectly matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for a logical structure (para-haloacetophenone) derived from all the given information.\n\n<<<B>>>"
