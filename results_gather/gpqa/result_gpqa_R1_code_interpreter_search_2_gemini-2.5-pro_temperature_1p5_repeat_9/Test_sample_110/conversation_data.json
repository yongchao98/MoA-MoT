    "This question asks for the major products of two separate chemical reactions, both of which are Michael additions. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone. To undergo a Michael addition, it must first be converted into a nucleophile, which is an enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. Its role is to deprotonate the ketone to form the enolate.\n    *   The overall reaction is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will remove an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6, forming a single regioisomer of the enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C6 acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (e.g., during workup) neutralizes the intermediate to give the final product.\n\n    The connectivity of the product is as follows: The `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group from ethyl acrylate is attached to the C6 position of the original 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one ring.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (Product A):**\n    *   The product is named as an ethyl propanoate derivative. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The substituent is attached at carbon 3 of the propanoate chain. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1. We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other functional groups and substituents.\n        *   Point of attachment (original C6): This is now **C1**. It has a methyl group.\n        *   Carbonyl group (original C1): This is now **C2**. It is an 'oxo' group.\n        *   Quaternary carbon (original C2): This is now **C3**. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Following IUPAC rules, numbering C1 → C2 → C3... gives lower locants (1,2,3,3) than the alternative direction.\n    *   The substituent name is therefore **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given in options C and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base used to deprotonate the 1-nitropropane.\n    *   The overall reaction is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates 1-nitropropane at its α-carbon (C1) to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`), which is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the CN group).\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between C1 of 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile system.\n    *   The resulting anion is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n    The structure of the product is: `NC–CH₂–CH(CH₃)–CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃`\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (Product B):**\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (–CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (–NO₂). Therefore, the compound is named as a substituted alkanenitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is identified as the parent chain.\n        `¹NC–²CH₂–³CH(CH₃)–⁴CH(NO₂)⁵CH₂⁶CH₃`\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given in options B and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that both names match the products described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
