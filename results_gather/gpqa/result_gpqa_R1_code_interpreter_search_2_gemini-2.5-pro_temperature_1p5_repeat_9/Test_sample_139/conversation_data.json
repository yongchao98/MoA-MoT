    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances involved.**\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 3.85 °C. This is remarkably close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Standard water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   **Clue 5: \"G, when heated, releases B.\"**\n        *   Since B is D₂O, G is a substance that releases D₂O upon heating. This is characteristic of a deuterated hydrate, most likely a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)n), which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O (e.g., M(OD)n → MₓOᵧ + D₂O).\n    *   **Clue 4: \"a precipitate G forms\"**\n        *   From the previous step, G is a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n. The fact that it's a precipitate means the corresponding hydroxide, M(OH)n, is insoluble in water. Many metal hydroxides are insoluble, but a very common one encountered in introductory chemistry is aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, which forms a gelatinous precipitate. Let's hypothesize that G is **Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Clue 1, 3 & 8: Identifying X, W, and the reaction.**\n        *   The initial reaction is X + Y → W (gas) + G (precipitate, Al(OD)₃).\n        *   Clue 1 states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" This fits with our findings of deuterium.\n        *   Clue 8 states X's \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Since we've identified Aluminum in G, this points strongly towards Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very powerful and common reducing agent. Therefore, substance X, its deuterated version, must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Clue 3 states gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's see if the reaction of LiAlD₄ produces such a gas. A violent reaction occurs when LiAlH₄ is mixed with water. So, let's assume Y is D₂O (heavy water).\n        *   The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n        *   Let's check the gas W, which is D₂ (deuterium gas). A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n    *   **Clue 7: Verifying with the organic reaction.**\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). LiAlH₄ (the analog of X) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups to alcohols (-OH).\n        *   R-C(=O)-(CH₂)n-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CH(OD)-(CH₂)n-CH₂(OD)\n        *   The product is a diol (or its deuterated equivalent), which contains two oxygen atoms. This clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Confirm the identities.**\n    *   **X**: LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride)\n    *   **Y**: D₂O (Heavy Water)\n    *   **W**: D₂ (Deuterium gas)\n    *   **G**: Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum Deuteroxide precipitate)\n    *   **B**: D₂O (Heavy Water)\n    All clues are satisfied with this set of substances.\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   We need the atomic mass numbers for the calculation:\n        *   Lithium (Li) has a mass number of ~7.\n        *   Aluminum (Al) has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Deuterium (D) has a mass number of 2.\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen** (represented by D).\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all ... isotopes must be summed\" means we need to account for all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms**: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D).\n        *   Cumulative mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms**: There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al).\n        *   Cumulative mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total cumulative sum** = (Mass from Hydrogen atoms) + (Mass from Aluminum atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
