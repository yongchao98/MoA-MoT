    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Quantities**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the two energy terms we are asked to compare:\n\n*   **Transition Energy `ΔE`**: This is the energy difference between two atomic orbitals in a Hydrogen atom. This energy is released or absorbed as a photon with a specific wavelength `λ`. The relationship is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n    $ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $\n    where:\n    *   $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$)\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$)\n    *   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon ($0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$)\n\n*   **Paramagnetic Coupling Term `⟨H⟩`**: This is the energy of interaction between the atom's magnetic dipole moment and an external magnetic field. This is also known as the Zeeman effect. The energy is given by:\n    $ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B $\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number (given as a small integer, we can use $m=1$ for the order of magnitude calculation).\n    *   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant ($9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$).\n    *   $B$ is the magnitude of the external magnetic field (given as $1 \\text{ T}$).\n\n**2. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nTo compare the two quantities, we'll calculate their values. It is convenient to work in units of electron-volts (eV), which are commonly used in atomic physics.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Quantities and Formulas**\n\nWe need to compare two distinct energy values:\n*   **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed when an electron in a Hydrogen atom transitions between two energy levels. It is related to the photon's wavelength ($\\lambda$) by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n    $ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $\n    Where:\n    *   $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$)\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$)\n    *   $\\lambda$ is the given wavelength ($0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$)\n\n*   **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**: This is the potential energy of the atom's orbital magnetic moment in an external magnetic field, also known as the Zeeman effect energy. It is given by:\n    $ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m_l \\mu_B B $\n    Where:\n    *   $m_l$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states it is a \"small\" value, so we can use $m_l=1$ for a representative order-of-magnitude calculation.\n    *   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental constant ($9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$ or $5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$).\n    *   $B$ is the magnitude of the external magnetic field ($1 \\text{ T}$).\n\n**2. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nWe will calculate both energies, conveniently using the unit of electron-volts (eV), which is standard for atomic physics.\n\n*   **Calculation of $\\Delta E$**:\n    First, convert the wavelength to meters: $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    Using the values of the constants:\n    $ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} $\n    Now, convert this energy to electron-volts (using $1 \\text{ eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$):\n    $ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV} $\n\n*   **Calculation of $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$**:\n    Using the given values ($m_l=1, B=1\\text{T}$) and the value of the Bohr magneton in eV/T:\n    $ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} $\n\n**3. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n*   Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe transition energy is on the order of electron-volts ($10^0$ eV), which is typical for visible light transitions in atoms. The paramagnetic coupling energy (Zeeman splitting) is on the order of $10^{-5}$ eV.\n\nSince $10^{-5}$ is many orders of magnitude smaller than $10^0$, it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling term is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $\n\nThe provided code output confirms this calculation precisely, showing that $\\Delta E$ is over 44,000 times larger than $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$. This means that the Zeeman effect from a 1T field is a very small perturbation on the primary energy levels of the hydrogen atom.\n\n<<<C>>>"
