    "*   **Step 1: Understand the relationship between a density matrix and the Bloch sphere.**\n\n    Any single-qubit density matrix, ρ, can be represented by a point inside or on the surface of a three-dimensional unit sphere called the Bloch sphere. This representation is given by the formula:\n\n    ρ = (1/2) * (I + **r** · **σ**)\n\n    where:\n    *   I is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   **r** = (r_x, r_y, r_z) is the Bloch vector, which is the geometrical position we are looking for.\n    *   **σ** = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n        *   σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n        *   σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n        *   σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\n*   **Step 2: Express the given density matrix in matrix form.**\n\n    The given density matrix is:\n    ρ = (1/2) * (|0><0| + |1><1|)\n\n    The basis vectors are:\n    *   |0> = [1, 0]^T\n    *   |1> = [0, 1]^T\n\n    So, the outer products are:\n    *   |0><0| = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]\n    *   |1><1| = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n    Adding them together:\n    |0><0| + |1><1| = [[1, 0], [0, 0]] + [[0, 0], [0, 1]] = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I (the identity matrix).\n\n    Therefore, the density matrix is:\n    ρ = (1/2) * I\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the Bloch vector r.**\n\n    We now have two expressions for ρ:\n    1.  ρ = (1/2) * (I + **r** · **σ**)\n    2.  ρ = (1/2) * I\n\n    Equating them:\n    (1/2) * I = (1/2) * (I + **r** · **σ**)\n\n    Multiply both sides by 2:\n    I = I + **r** · **σ**\n\n    Subtract I from both sides:\n    0 = **r** · **σ**\n    0 = r_x*σ_x + r_y*σ_y + r_z*σ_z\n\n    For this equation to hold, the sum of the matrices on the right must equal the zero matrix. The only way this is possible is if the coefficients are all zero.\n    r_x = 0\n    r_y = 0\n    r_z = 0\n\n    Thus, the Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\n*   **Step 4: Interpret the result.**\n\n    The vector **r** = (0, 0, 0) represents the origin or the center of the Bloch sphere. This point corresponds to the maximally mixed state, where the qubit has a 50% probability of being measured in state |0> and a 50% probability of being in state |1>, with no phase coherence between them. This is exactly what the density matrix ρ = (1/2) * (|0><0| + |1><1|) describes.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match with the given options.**\n\n    The calculated position is **r** = (0, 0, 0), which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
