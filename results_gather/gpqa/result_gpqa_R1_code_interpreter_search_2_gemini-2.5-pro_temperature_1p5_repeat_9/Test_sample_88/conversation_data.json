    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane is a rigid, symmetric cage molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** KOH (a strong base) at 240°C (high temperature).\n*   **Initial Analysis:** One might expect an elimination reaction, but forming a double bond at the bridgehead position of adamantane would violate Bredt's rule and is energetically unfavorable.\n*   **Spectral Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a very strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone within a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. The starting material has 14 hydrogens, so no hydrogens are lost. The molecular formula of the product must be C₁₀H₁₄O. This corresponds to the substitution of the two Br atoms with one oxygen atom, which is consistent with the balanced reaction: C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ + 2KOH → C₁₀H₁₄O + 2KBr + H₂O.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with aqueous base at high temperatures is a known, though mechanistically complex, procedure to synthesize **2-adamantanone**. The reaction involves hydrolysis and skeletal rearrangements. Although the provided ¹H NMR data (specifically the 4.79 ppm signal) is anomalous for 2-adamantanone, the IR data and the context of the subsequent reactions strongly support this assignment. The most stable ketone on a C10 adamantane framework is 2-adamantanone.\n\n**Product 1 is 2-adamantanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (2-adamantanone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a combination of two reactions:\n    1.  **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) Reduction:** Aluminum isopropoxide is a classic reagent for the MPV reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. So, 2-adamantanone is reduced to 2-adamantanol.\n    2.  **Dehydration with Rearrangement:** The problem states the mixture is heated. Al(O-iPr)₃ can act as a Lewis acid. Acid-catalyzed dehydration of 2-adamantanol is not straightforward. Direct elimination to form adamantene is disfavored by Bredt's rule. Instead, under these conditions, the intermediate secondary carbocation (at C-2) undergoes a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton to a more stable isomer, which can then eliminate a proton to form an alkene. The major product of this rearrangement is **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n*   **The key information is that Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, which definitively confirms that Product 2 is an alkene.**\n\n**Product 2 is protoadamantene (or a similar rearranged alkene).**\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (protoadamantene, an alkene with formula C₁₀H₁₄) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (C=O). Since the workup is reductive (DMS), any aldehydes formed will remain as aldehydes.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** Protoadamantene is a tricyclic alkene. Cleaving one of the rings' bonds with ozone will result in a **bicyclic** product containing two carbonyl groups. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene yields a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework with two aldehyde groups. The specific product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O₂.\n\n**Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In a dialdehyde, the most deshielded protons are the aldehydic protons (-CHO), which typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm. These protons do not exchange with D₂O. Due to the symmetry of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, the two aldehyde protons are chemically equivalent. We only need to analyze the splitting for one of them.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** Let's analyze the aldehyde proton attached to C3.\n    1.  **³J Coupling (through 3 bonds):** The aldehyde proton (H-C=O) is separated by three bonds from the methine proton on C3 (H-C₃). This will split the aldehyde signal. Since there is only one proton on C3, this coupling will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **⁴J Coupling (through 4 bonds):** Long-range coupling is significant in rigid bicyclic systems. The aldehyde proton can couple with protons four bonds away. The protons on C2 and C4 are four bonds away. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable dual chair conformation. To minimize steric hindrance, the bulky aldehyde groups occupy the equatorial positions. This geometry creates a \"W\" or \"M\" shaped pathway between the aldehyde proton and the two *axial* protons on C2 and C4. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two axial protons are equivalent. Coupling to these two equivalent protons will split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n*   **Final Pattern:** The aldehyde signal is first split into a doublet by the C3-proton, and each line of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the two equivalent axial protons on C2 and C4. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**."
