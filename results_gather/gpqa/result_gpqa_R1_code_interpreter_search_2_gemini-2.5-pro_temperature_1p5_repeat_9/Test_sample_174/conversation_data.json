    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape and a symmetry axis along the z-axis. When a charge distribution oscillates, it acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The simplest and most dominant model for such an oscillating system, especially at wavelengths much larger than the size of the spheroid, is an **oscillating electric dipole**. We assume the dipole moment oscillates along the symmetry axis (z-axis).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is a standard result from classical electrodynamics. The formula is:\n    `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n    where:\n    *   `θ` is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis in this case).\n    *   `K` is a factor that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment (`p₀`) and the angular frequency of oscillation (`ω`), but not on the angle `θ`. The full expression is `K = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² ε₀ c³)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Angular Dependence and Maximum Power:**\n    *   The radiated power per unit solid angle is given by the function `f(λ, θ)`. From the dipole radiation formula, we see its angular dependence is `f ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n    *   The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   So, we can write `A = f_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`.\n    *   This allows us to express the power at any angle `θ` in terms of the maximum power `A`:\n        `f(λ, θ) = A * sin²(θ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:**\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We use the formula derived above:\n        `f(at 30°) = A * sin²(30°)`.\n    *   The value of `sin(30°)` is `1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   So, the power radiated at 30° is `f(at 30°) = A * (1/4) = A/4`.\n    *   The question asks for the **fraction** of `A` that is radiated at this angle. This fraction is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    *   Now we need to find a possible form for `f`, specifically its dependence on the wavelength `λ`.\n    *   We look back at the factor `K = A`. The formula for `K` is `K = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² ε₀ c³)`.\n    *   This shows that the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency: `f ∝ ω⁴`.\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the relation `ω = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c/λ)`.\n    *   Substituting this into our proportionality:\n        `f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (c/λ)⁴`.\n    *   Since `c` is a constant, the power `f` is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength:\n        `f ∝ 1/λ⁴` or `f ∝ λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously the reason for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n6.  **Combine the Results:**\n    *   The fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form of `f` includes a dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n7.  **Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   Comparing our findings with the given options:\n        *   A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴  -> This matches both of our results.\n        *   B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴  -> The fraction is incorrect.\n        *   C) 1/4, λ⁻³  -> The wavelength dependence is incorrect.\n        *   D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶  -> Both the fraction and the wavelength dependence are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
