    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   Substituent at C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt). This is a strongly activating, ortho/para-directing group.\n*   Substituent at C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu). This is a weakly activating, ortho/para-directing group. It is very bulky.\n*   Substituent at C3: Nitro group (-NO2). This is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\nRelative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. General Strategy and Key Transformations\n\nThe options provided list a set of common organic reactions. Let's identify key transformations:\n*   **Formation of the ethoxy group (-OEt):** The reagents `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization of NH2), `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolysis of diazonium salt to OH), and `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis from OH to OEt) strongly suggest that the ethoxy group is formed from a nitro group. This implies that at some stage, the molecule must have two nitro groups: one that will be converted to the ethoxy group, and one that remains in the final product.\n*   **Introduction of the t-butyl group:** This is done by Friedel-Crafts alkylation using `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`.\n*   **Use of a blocking group:** The presence of `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation) and `dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) suggests the use of the sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a reversible blocking group. This is a common strategy to control the position of substitution, especially to force an electrophile into an ortho position when the para position is sterically favored. The t-butyl group is very bulky and strongly favors para substitution, so blocking the para position is a classic way to achieve ortho substitution in high yield.\n\n### 3. Devising a Plausible Synthesis Pathway\n\nBased on the analysis above, a logical high-yield synthesis can be constructed. The main challenge is achieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, particularly getting two ortho relationships involving the bulky t-butyl group.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Blocking the Para Position.** To force the next substituent into the ortho position, we block the sterically favored para position.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**\n\n3.  **Step 3: First Nitration.** Now, nitration will occur at the position ortho to the t-butyl group.\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. We now have the t-butyl group and a nitro group ortho to each other.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Second Nitration.** We need to introduce the second nitro group, which will eventually become the ethoxy group. Let's analyze the directing effects on the current intermediate (numbering with t-Bu at C1, NO2 at C2, SO3H at C4):\n    *   -tBu (at C1) is an o,p-director, directing to position 6 (positions 2 and 4 are occupied).\n    *   -NO2 (at C2) is a m-director, directing to position 6 (position 4 is occupied).\n    *   -SO3H (at C4) is a m-director, directing to position 6 (position 2 is occupied).\n    *   All three groups direct the incoming electrophile to position 6. This concerted effect will lead to a high-yield reaction.\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Selective Reduction.** We now have two nitro groups at positions 2 and 6. The molecule is `1-tBu-2,6-dinitro-4-sulfonic acid`. These two nitro groups are ortho to the bulky t-butyl group and are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry (with respect to the C1-C4 axis). Reduction of one of these will occur.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n6.  **Step 6-8: Conversion of Amino to Ethoxy Group.** Now we convert the newly formed amino group into an ethoxy group.\n    *   Step 6: + `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazotization to form `2-diazonium-4-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   Step 7: + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> Hydrolysis to `2-hydroxy-4-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   Step 8: + `NaOH/EtBr` -> Etherification to `2-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n7.  **Step 9: Removing the Blocking Group.** The final step is to remove the sulfonic acid blocking group.\n    *   2-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `dilute H2SO4` -> **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nLet's verify the name of the final product. The intermediate before desulfonation has substituents at C2 (Ethoxy), C4 (t-Butyl), C6 (Nitro). After removing the group at C1 (SO3H), the final molecule has the groups arranged as 1-ethoxy, 3-tert-butyl, 5-nitrobenzene. Wait, let me retrace the structure after step 9.\n\nPrecursor: `2-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Removing SO3H from C1. We get a benzene ring with OEt at C2, tBu at C4, NO2 at C6.\nLet's draw this molecule and number it according to IUPAC rules:\n- Benzene ring with -OEt, -tBu, -NO2. The relative positions are: OEt to tBu is meta (1,3). tBu to NO2 is meta (1,3). OEt to NO2 is para (1,4). This leads to `1-ethoxy-3-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzene`. My analysis was wrong.\n\nLet's re-run the synthesis, but this time, the first nitro group becomes the final nitro group, and the second one becomes the ethoxy group.\nPath up to step 4 is the same: **4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\nThe nitro groups are at C2 and C6. NO2 at C2 is the one we made first. Let's reduce the *other* one at C6. Since they are equivalent, either can be reduced. Let's say the one at C6 is reduced.\n5. Reduction: `Fe/HCl` -> **6-amino-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6. Conversion `NH2 -> OEt` on C6: `NaNO2/HCl`, `H2O`, `NaOH/EtBr` -> **6-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n7. Desulfonation: `dilute H2SO4`. This removes SO3H from C1.\nWe get a benzene ring with -OEt at C6, -tBu at C4, -NO2 at C2.\nLet's name this molecule. IUPAC priority: OEt > NO2. Lowest locant set.\nNumbering from OEt at C1: OEt(1), NO2(3), tBu(5). `1-ethoxy-5-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`. Still the wrong isomer.\n\nLet's re-think the key intermediate again.\nMaybe the desulfonation happens earlier.\n1. `tBuCl/AlCl3` -> `t-butylbenzene`\n2. `SO3/H2SO4` -> `4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n3. `HNO3/H2SO4` -> `4-t-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n4. `dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) -> `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. This gives us the key ortho `tBu/NO2` relationship in high yield. Let's call this our final NO2.\n5. Now, we nitrate this again: `HNO3/H2SO4` on `1-tBu-2-nitrobenzene`.\n   - tBu (C1) directs to 4, 6.\n   - NO2 (C2) directs to 4, 6.\n   - We get a mixture of `1-tBu-2,4-dinitrobenzene` and `1-tBu-2,6-dinitrobenzene`. Let's take the 2,6-isomer.\n6. We now have `1-tBu-2(final)-NO2, 6(precursor)-NO2`.\n7. Reduce the precursor `NO2` at C6: `Fe/HCl` -> `2-tBu-6-nitro-aniline`.\n8. Convert `NH2` to `OEt`: `NaNO2/HCl`, `H2O`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n9. Final product: `1-OEt-2-tBu-3-NO2`. Let's re-number my product `1-tBu-2(final)-NO2-6-OEt`. OEt gets C1. Go towards tBu, it's at C2. NO2 is at C3. This is **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the TARGET.\n\nSo, the correct sequence of reactions is:\n(1) tBuCl/AlCl3\n(2) SO3/H2SO4 (block)\n(3) HNO3/H2SO4 (first nitration)\n(4) dilute H2SO4 (de-block)\n(5) HNO3/H2SO4 (second nitration)\n(6) Fe/HCl (reduction)\n(7) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization)\n(8) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis)\n(9) NaOH/EtBr (etherification)\n\n### 4. Matching the Pathway to the Options\n\nNow we compare this correct sequence of *reagent types* to the reagent inventory in the given options.\nOur required reagents: `tBuCl`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `HNO3/H2SO4` (x2), `dilute H2SO4`, `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H2O/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's check the inventory of each option:\n*   **A)** Has only one `HNO3/H2SO4`. Incorrect inventory.\n*   **B)** Has `tBuCl`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `HNO3/H2SO4` (x2, one at ii, one at ix), `dilute H2SO4`, `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H2O/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`. **This option has the correct inventory of reagents.** The sequence presented in the option is chemically nonsensical, but it is the only option that provides all the necessary components for the correct synthesis.\n*   **C)** Has only one `HNO3/H2SO4`. Incorrect inventory.\n*   **D)** Has only one `HNO3/H2SO4`. Incorrect inventory.\n\nConclusion: The problem is flawed as the sequence in option B is incorrect. However, option B is the only one that provides the correct set of reagents required for the valid synthesis pathway. In the context of a multiple-choice question with potential errors, selecting the option with the correct reagent inventory is the most logical choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
