    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (a delta-lactone). It has one chiral center at position C4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxyalkanoic acid. In this case, the precursor must be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options provide isomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's deduce its structure. It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) with an ethyl group at C3. One carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH), and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    Structure: HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5).\n    This molecule has one chiral center at C3. A and B are enantiomers of this compound.\n*   **Reagent 1 (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The -COOH group is generally unreactive towards LiBH₄.\n*   **Reagent 2 (BH₃):** Borane is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n**3. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) → Intermediate P1 (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH).\n    P1 is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of P1. The -OH from C5 attacks the -COOH at C1 to form the 6-membered lactone. The C3 of the acid becomes the C4 of the lactone. This reaction does not affect the stereochemistry at the chiral center.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** We need to track the (R/S) designation throughout the reaction. This requires comparing the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n\n    *   **For Starting Material A:** The groups at the chiral center C3 are:\n        1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (highest priority: C → C(=O) → O-C)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (second priority: C → C(=O) → O-H)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **For Intermediate P1 (Hydroxy acid):** The groups at C3 are:\n        1.  `-CH₂-COOH` (highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂-CH₂OH` (second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  `-H`\n        Notice that the group that was priority #1 in A (`-CH₂-COOiBu`) becomes the group that is priority #2 in P1 (`-CH₂-CH₂OH`), and the group that was priority #2 in A (`-CH₂-COOH`) becomes priority #1 in P1. **The priorities of the top two groups have swapped.** This causes an inversion of the (R/S) designation. For example, if A is (S), P1 will be (R).\n    *   **For the Lactone:** The lactonization step does not change the priority order of the groups relative to P1.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sequence is: A → P1 (R/S flip) → Lactone (R/S hold). To obtain the **(R)-lactone**, the intermediate P1 must be (R), which means the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) → Intermediate P2 (HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu).\n    P2 is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The chiral center at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The -OH group (from the reduced C1) attacks the ester carbonyl (C5), displacing isobutanol to form the lactone. This reaction does not affect the stereochemistry at the chiral center.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n\n    *   **For Starting Material B:** The priorities are the same as for A:\n        1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu`\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH`\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **For Intermediate P2 (Hydroxy ester):** The groups at C3 are:\n        1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂-CH₂OH` (second priority, as -COOH was reduced)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  `-H`\n        The group that was priority #1 in B (`-CH₂-COOiBu`) remains priority #1 in P2. The group that was priority #2 in B (`-CH₂-COOH`) becomes priority #2 in P2 (`-CH₂-CH₂OH`). **The priority order of the groups does not change.** Therefore, the (R/S) designation is retained. For example, if B is (S), P2 will also be (S).\n    *   **For the Lactone:** The transesterification step also does not change the priority order relative to P2.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The sequence is: B → P2 (R/S hold) → Lactone (R/S hold). To obtain the **(S)-lactone**, the intermediate P2 must be (S), which means the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   To produce (R)-lactone via the LiBH₄ route, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n*   To produce (S)-lactone via the BH₃ route, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\nTherefore, both A and B are the same compound: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
