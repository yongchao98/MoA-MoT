    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in matrix form. Let's write them down.\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are recognized as the components of the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle, where the matrices are the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$. So, $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle with the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n    Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\\phi = 0$.\n    So, the unit vector for the direction is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator $P_{\\vec{n}}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the system of linear equations for the eigenvector components (a, b):**\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve for the relationship between $a$ and $b$ using the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Now, we use trigonometric half-angle identities to simplify this expression:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    To simplify and normalize the eigenvector, we can choose a convenient value for $a$. Let $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$, where C is a normalization constant.\n    Then $b = (C \\cos(\\theta/2)) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    The eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    The normalization condition requires that the inner product $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 \\left( (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* \\cos(\\theta/2) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* \\sin(\\theta/2) \\right) = 1$\n    Since $\\theta$ is real, the components are real, so this becomes:\n    $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    $|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$.\n    We can choose the simplest normalization constant, $C=1$.\n\n7.  **Final Eigenvector:**\n    The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are state vectors and do not have units of $\\hbar$.\n    B) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect for the same reason.\n    C) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\n    D) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - This matches our result perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
