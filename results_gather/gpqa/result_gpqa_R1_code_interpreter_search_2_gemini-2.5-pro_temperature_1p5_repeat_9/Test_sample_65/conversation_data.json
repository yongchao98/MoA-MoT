    "*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a relativistic quantum field theory. This means it is fundamentally based on the principles of special relativity, a cornerstone of which is Lorentz invariance. All fields in the theory transform in specific ways under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts), and all operators in the Lagrangian must be constructed to be Lorentz scalars (invariant under these transformations). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n*   **2. Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. It includes Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) plus spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. The SMEFT Lagrangian, like any standard QFT Lagrangian, is assumed to be invariant under spacetime translations. Thus, Poincare symmetry is a fundamental assumption of the SMEFT framework. Since Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, respecting Poincare implies respecting Lorentz.\n\n*   **3. CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, specifically by the weak interactions (as described by the complex phase in the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, it must accommodate this known violation. Furthermore, one can construct new higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT that provide additional sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n*   **4. CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the principles above, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry. Therefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
