    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a mixture containing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The approach involves a series of neutralization reactions. First, the strong acid and strong base will react, followed by the reaction of any excess acid or base with the weak acid.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance.**\n\n*   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely: Moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**2. Neutralization of the strong acid and strong base.**\n\nThe H+ ions from HCl will react with the OH- ions from Ba(OH)2.\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   H+ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H+ will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\nAfter this step, the solution contains 0.100 mol of excess OH- ions.\n\n**3. Reaction of the excess strong base with the weak acid.**\n\nThe remaining OH- ions will now react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n*   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 mol of CH3COOH will be consumed.\n*   Moles of CH3COO- (acetate) formed = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n**4. Determine the final composition and calculate pH.**\n\nThe final solution contains:\n*   0.050 mol of excess strong base (OH-).\n*   0.050 mol of weak base (CH3COO-).\n*   Spectator ions (Ba2+, Cl-).\n\nThe pH of the solution will be dominated by the concentration of the strong base (OH-), as the OH- produced by the hydrolysis of the weak base (CH3COO-) is negligible due to the common ion effect.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
