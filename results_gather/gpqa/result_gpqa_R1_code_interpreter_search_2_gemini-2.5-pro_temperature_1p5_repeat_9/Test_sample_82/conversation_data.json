    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Initial Setup and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we calculate the initial number of moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 moles.\n\n*   Next, this solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same (0.001 moles).\n    *   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n        *   New Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n### **2. Titration Reaction and Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The titration reaction is between a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and a strong base (NaOH):\n    *   CH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n*   The reaction is a 1:1 molar ratio. At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence (V_eq) = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n### **3. Calculating pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. At this point, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([Conjugate Base]/[Acid])\n*   The pKa of acetic acid is:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   Ratio of [Conjugate Base]/[Acid] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Therefore, the pH is:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n\n### **4. Calculating pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the initial 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been converted into 0.001 moles of its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the pOH. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] = x and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    *   Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can approximate: Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n*   Now, we solve for x ([OH⁻]):\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02)\n*   Finally, we find the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nTo get the precise numerical values, the following Python code is used to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75\nratio = 0.25 / 0.75\nlog_ratio = math.log10(ratio)\n\n# Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + log_ratio\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = 0.05 * 0.020  # 0.001 moles\n\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence point\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / 0.1  # 0.010 L\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\n# Initial diluted acid volume (20ml acid + 20ml water) + NaOH volume\ntotal_vol_eq = (0.020 + 0.020) + vol_NaOH_eq # 0.050 L\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq # 0.02 M\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = x^2 / [acetate]\n# x = [OH-]\nhydroxyl_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(hydroxyl_conc)\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### **Detailed Reasoning and Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and the Dilution Step**\n\n*   **Initial Acetic Acid:** We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 mol/L\n    *   Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:\n        *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.0200 L = **0.001 moles of CH₃COOH**.\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same (0.001 moles).\n    *   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution, which will be the starting concentration for the titration:\n        *   New Concentration ([HA]₀) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = **0.025 M**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Titration and Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The titration reaction is CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n*   **25% Titration Point:** This is a point before the equivalence point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Acid remaining (CH₃COOH): 100% - 25% = 75%\n    *   Conjugate base formed (CH₃COO⁻): 25%\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** At this point, we have a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Acid] )\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] )\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   First, find the pKa from the given Ka:\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   The ratio of [Conjugate Base] to [Acid] is the ratio of their mole percentages, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = **4.256**\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Analyze and Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   **Equivalence Point Definition:** This is the point where the moles of NaOH added exactly equal the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.001 moles.\n    *   At this point, all the CH₃COOH has been converted into its conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻.\n*   **Volume Calculation:** We need to find the total volume of the solution to calculate the concentration of the acetate.\n    *   Volume of NaOH needed = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total Volume = Initial diluted acid volume + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = **0.0500 L**.\n*   **Acetate Concentration:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze), producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Now we use an ICE table for the hydrolysis, where x = [OH⁻]:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n        *   x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = **8.517**\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n*   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
