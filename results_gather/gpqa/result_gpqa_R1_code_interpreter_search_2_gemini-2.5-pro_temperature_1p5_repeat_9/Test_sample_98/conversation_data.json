    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the correct chemical structure from four options.\n    *   **Given Data:**\n        *   FTIR Spectrum: Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹.\n        *   1H NMR Spectrum: No vinyl hydrogens. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).\n    *   **Candidates:**\n        A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\n        B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n        C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\n        D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer (due to hydrogen bonding).\n    *   A strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O bond stretch in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the candidates.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\":** This means there are no protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons of a C=C double bond. All four candidate structures are saturated (only single bonds between carbons), so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **The Splitting Patterns:** This is the crucial information for distinguishing the isomers. We need to find the structure that has protons which would give rise to both a `doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)` and a `doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)`.\n    *   **Understanding Splitting:** A proton's signal is split by its non-equivalent neighboring protons. The multiplicity follows the n+1 rule (where n is the number of equivalent neighboring protons). A complex splitting pattern like `dtq` means the proton is coupled to three *different* sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   `dtq` implies coupling to: 1 proton (d), 2 protons (t), and 3 protons (q).\n        *   `dtt` implies coupling to: 1 proton (d), 2 protons (t), and another 2 protons (t).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    Let's draw each structure and analyze the environments of the methine (C-H) protons, as they are the most likely to have such complex splitting. We will number the main carbon chain starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n    *   **Candidate A: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n        *   IUPAC Name: 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid\n        *   Structure: `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C2 (H-C2): Coupled to H-C3 (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, gives a triplet). Expected splitting: **dt** (doublet of triplets).\n        *   Proton at C3 (H-C3): Coupled to H-C2 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ at C4 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives a triplet). Expected splitting: **dtt**.\n        *   **Assessment:** This molecule has a `dtt` signal but lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtq`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **Candidate C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n        *   IUPAC Name: 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid\n        *   Structure: `CH3(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3 (H-C3): Coupled to H-C4 (1H, d), the CH₂ at C2 (2H, t), and the methyl group on C3 (3H, q). Expected splitting: **dtq**.\n        *   Proton at C4 (H-C4): Coupled to H-C3 (1H, d), the CH₃ at C5 (3H, q), and the methyl group on C4 (3H, q). Expected splitting: **dqq** (doublet of quartets of quartets).\n        *   **Assessment:** This molecule has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **Candidate D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n        *   IUPAC Name: 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid\n        *   Structure: `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C2 (H-C2): Coupled to H-C3 (1H, d) and the methyl on C2 (3H, q). Expected splitting: **dq** (doublet of quartets).\n        *   Proton at C3 (H-C3): Coupled to H-C2 (1H, d), the CH₂ at C4 (2H, t), and the methyl on C3 (3H, q). Expected splitting: **dtq**.\n        *   **Assessment:** This molecule has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **Candidate B: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n        *   IUPAC Name: 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid\n        *   Structure: `CH3(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   Proton at C3 (H-C3): Coupled to H-C4 (1H, gives a **doublet**), the CH₂ at C2 (2H, gives a **triplet**), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, gives another **triplet**). Expected splitting: **dtt**. This matches one of the required signals.\n        *   Proton at C4 (H-C4): Coupled to H-C3 (1H, gives a **doublet**), the CH₃ at C5 (3H, gives a **quartet**), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, gives a **triplet**). Expected splitting: **dtq** (or dqt, the order depends on the coupling constant sizes). This matches the other required signal.\n        *   **Assessment:** This is the only structure that contains protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns described in the problem.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, the unknown compound must be `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
