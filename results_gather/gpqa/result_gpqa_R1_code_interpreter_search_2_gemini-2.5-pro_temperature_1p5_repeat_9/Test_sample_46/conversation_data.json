    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) or Double Bond Equivalent.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBE (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining 1 DBE is typically a C=O or C=C double bond. This strongly suggests the presence of a substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands.\n    *   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is in the range for an ester (typically 1735-1750 cm-1 for saturated esters, slightly lower for conjugated esters) or a ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, an ester is very likely. The conjugation with a benzene ring would lower the frequency, making 1720 cm-1 a perfect value for an aromatic ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the tell-tale sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n        *   The protons causing the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) must be adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like C=O).\n        *   The protons causing the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) must be adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -NH2 or -OR).\n    *   **Ethyl Group:** The combination of a triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** and a quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)** is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n        *   The -CH3 group (1.20 ppm) is split into a triplet by the adjacent -CH2 group (2 neighbors + 1 = 3 peaks).\n        *   The -CH2 group (4.5 ppm) is split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 group (3 neighbors + 1 = 4 peaks).\n        *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the -CH2- protons (4.5 ppm) indicates they are attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-COOCH2CH3) or an ether (-O-CH2CH3). Given the C=O from the IR, an ethyl ester is the most plausible structure.\n    *   **Amine Protons:** The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is consistent with the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Putting It All Together and Evaluating Options**\n    *   From the analysis, we have determined the following structural fragments:\n        1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        2.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n        3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Assembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The electron-donating -NH2 group and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are in a para arrangement on the benzene ring. This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethyl ester. The -CH2- protons would be next to the C=O, appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has meta (1,3) substitution, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets. Also, it's an amide, and the ester C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1 is a better fit than for a simple amide.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR, and the NMR would show a 1H signal for the amide proton, not a 2H signal. It also contains a formyl proton (-CHO) which would appear as a singlet around 8-8.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is unambiguously identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
