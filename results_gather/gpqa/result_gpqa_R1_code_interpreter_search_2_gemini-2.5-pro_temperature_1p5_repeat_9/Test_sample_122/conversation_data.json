    "Answering this question requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S).\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames (v) is 60,000 km/s. From the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at this speed. This means from the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at the same speed v.\n    *   The time measured in the ejecta's own reference frame (the proper time, Δt₀) is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   The velocity (v) is known (60,000 km/s).\n    *   The time we need is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (S), which we'll call Δt.\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   Due to the effects of special relativity, an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (Δt) for the event that takes 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame (Δt₀). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio v/c:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = Δt₀ / sqrt(0.96) = 50 s / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n\nLet's compute the final value using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # s (proper time in ejecta's frame)\nc = 300000  # km/s (speed of light)\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n> executing\n3061862.178478972\n> execution finished\nThe calculation shows that the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This is very close to option C.\n\nLet's re-verify the calculation:\nd = 60,000 * (50 / sqrt(0.96))\nd = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)\nd ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979795897...\nd ≈ 3,061,862.17 km\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3,000,000 km\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance (3,061,862 km) is closest to 3,060,000 km. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n- The time measured in the moving frame (ejecta) is the proper time Δt₀.\n- We need to find the distance in the stationary frame (Galaxy), which is `d = v * Δt`.\n- We need to find the time Δt in the stationary frame, which is dilated relative to the proper time.\n- The formula `Δt = γ * Δt₀` is correct.\n- The calculation is correct.\n\nThe distance is `d = v * γ * Δt₀`, which is greater than the non-relativistic distance `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`. This confirms that the answer must be larger than 3,000,000 km, eliminating options A, B, and D. Option C is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame. This requires using the concept of time dilation from special relativity.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames and variables:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (S) is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The ejecta's reference frame (S') is the \"moving\" frame.\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n2.  **Determine the required time:**\n    To find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we need to know the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, which we'll call `Δt`. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    According to the theory of special relativity, time for a moving object (as observed from a stationary frame) passes more slowly. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the gamma formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance (d):**\n    Now, we can calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    Using the provided code output for the precise calculation:\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862.18 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without relativistic effects).\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option C, 3,060,000 km. The small difference is due to rounding in the option choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
