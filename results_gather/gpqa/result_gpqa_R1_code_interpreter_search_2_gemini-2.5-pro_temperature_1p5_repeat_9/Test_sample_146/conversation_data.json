    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a particle annihilation process, which must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the velocities are likely to be high, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The process starts with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the same rest mass, $m_{\\bar{p}} = m_p$.\n    *   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in such problems, implying that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest before the annihilation.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton:\n        $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n    *   Since both particles are considered to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) is zero.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   All four particles have the same mass $m_A$, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   From the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_f$) must also be zero. For the total vector momentum of the four final particles to be zero, and since they all have the same mass, they must all be moving with the same speed, $v_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n        $E_f = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   We equate the initial energy and the final energy:\n        $E_i = E_f$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n    *   We can solve this equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the velocity:**\n    *   Substitute the known values for the rest mass energies:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity $v_A$. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Now, we'll perform the final calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest mass energy of proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300     # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# From conservation of energy, we found the expression for the Lorentz factor gamma\n# gamma = (m_p_c2) / (2 * m_A_c2)\ngamma_A = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now, calculate beta (v/c) from gamma\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A**2)\n\n# Print the velocity as a fraction of c\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) at rest results in the creation of four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. This process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The system consists of a proton and an antiproton.\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\", which is a common physics problem simplification meaning its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are at rest.\n*   The total initial momentum is therefore zero ($P_i = 0$).\n*   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The antiproton has the same rest mass, $m_{\\bar{p}} = m_p$.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass.\n*   The rest mass energy of each A particle is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_f = 0$). For the total momentum to be zero, the four particles must be moving away from the collision point. Given they all have the same mass, they must all have the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. The energy of a single moving particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   We equate the initial and final energies:\n    $E_i = E_f$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n*   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity:**\n*   Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n*   Rearranging the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of each particle A is approximately $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThe code execution confirms this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest mass energy of proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300     # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# From conservation of energy, we found the expression for the Lorentz factor gamma\n# gamma = (m_p_c2) / (2 * m_A_c2)\ngamma_A = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now, calculate beta (v/c) from gamma\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A**2)\n\n# Print the velocity as a fraction of c\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n\n```\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem is solved by applying the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Initial Energy ($E_i$)**: The initial state consists of a proton and an antiproton, both considered to be at rest (since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is negligible). The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   $m_p c^2$ (rest energy of a proton) $\\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$ (rest energy of an antiproton) $\\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final Energy ($E_f$)**: The final state consists of four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$), all with the same mass $m_A$ and moving at the same speed $v$. The total final energy is the sum of their relativistic energies.\n    *   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   The relativistic energy of one particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2 = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy**: Equate the initial and final energies.\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.563$\n\n4.  **Calculate Velocity**: Now, solve for the velocity $v$ (in terms of $c$, the speed of light) using the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.408} \\approx \\sqrt{0.592} \\approx 0.77$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
