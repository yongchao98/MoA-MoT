    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The structure is CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3, where the two propyl groups (CH3CH2CH2-) are on opposite sides of the double bond. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction proceeds in two steps.\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition. The oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond. For an (E)-alkene with identical substituents, a *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric trans-epoxides.\n        *   (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA â†’ Racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, resulting in an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups overall with respect to each other.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to an (E)-alkene with identical substituents is that it produces a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's trace the mechanism:\n        *   The (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes nucleophilic attack by water. The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at one of the stereocenters (e.g., C4). This leads to a (4S,5R)-diol.\n        *   The (4S,5S)-epoxide also undergoes nucleophilic attack, leading to a (4R,5S)-diol.\n        *   The (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) configurations describe the same single, achiral molecule: *meso*-octane-4,5-diol. This compound has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. The two propyl groups are on the same side of the double bond. This molecule is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to a (Z)-alkene with identical substituents is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace the mechanism:\n        1.  **Epoxidation:** *syn*-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a *meso*-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This is a single, achiral compound.\n        2.  **Ring-opening:** Acid-catalyzed opening of the *meso*-epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition. Attack on the two epoxide carbons (C4 and C5) are equally likely.\n            *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S. The configuration at C5 (which is S) is retained. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R. The configuration at C4 (which is R) is retained. The product is (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, i.e., enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1) - Let's call this **M**.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2) - Let's call this **E1**.\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2) - Let's call this **E2**.\n\nThe stereoisomeric relationships are:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **E1** and **E2**.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M and E1) have different physical properties and will have different retention times.\n    *   Enantiomers (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n    *   **Observation:**\n        *   One peak for the meso compound (M).\n        *   One peak for the co-eluting enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers (E1 and E2) will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   The meso compound (M), being a diastereomer of E1 and E2, will also have a different retention time from both of them. Since M is achiral, it gives only a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:**\n        *   One peak for the meso compound (M).\n        *   One peak for the (4R,5R) enantiomer (E1).\n        *   One peak for the (4S,5S) enantiomer (E2).\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 3\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
