    "1.  **Analyze the Reactant and Reaction Type:**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbons 2 and 6 (i.e., C2=C3 and C6=C7).\n    *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-C4H9) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    Let's draw the structure:\n    CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(C₄H₉)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n     1   2   3    4      5         6   7    8    9\n\n    The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. The difference is 6 - 2 = 4. This corresponds to a C=C-C-C-C=C pattern, which is characteristic of a 1,5-diene system.\n    Heating a 1,5-diene is the classic condition for a Cope rearrangement, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. This reaction converts a 1,5-diene into an isomeric 1,5-diene. The reaction is intramolecular and concerted, proceeding through a six-membered, chair-like transition state.\n\n2.  **Identify the Rearranging System:**\n    The six carbons involved in the rearrangement are C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7.\n    The core system is: `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`.\n    This system is substituted as follows:\n    *   At C2: a methyl group (-CH₃, which is C1 of the main chain)\n    *   At C4: two hydrogen atoms\n    *   At C5: a butyl group (-C₄H₉) and a hydrogen atom\n    *   At C7: an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃, which is C8 and C9 of the main chain)\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Transformation:**\n    The Cope rearrangement can be visualized as the cleavage of the central sigma bond (the C3-C4 bond in a generic C1=C2-C3-C4-C5=C6 system) and the formation of a new sigma bond between the terminal carbons (C1 and C6), along with a shift of the pi bonds.\n    For acyclic systems, a useful mnemonic that predicts the product structure is as follows:\n    The molecule is viewed as two allyl fragments joined by the central sigma bond. The reaction essentially \"inverts\" each fragment and joins them via a new single bond between the carbons that were originally the central carbons of the allyl systems. The substituents on the central carbons of the original diene become the terminal groups of the new, longer main chain.\n\n    Let's apply this to our molecule:\n    *   **System:** `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`\n    *   **Central sigma bond to break:** C4-C5\n    *   **Allyl fragment 1:** `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-` (This is the C1-C4 part of the reactant)\n    *   **Allyl fragment 2:** `-(C₄H₉)CH-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃` (This is the C5-C9 part of the reactant)\n\n    The transformation can be described by the following mapping, which is known to work for complex acyclic Cope rearrangements:\n    `[Substituent on C4]-C4=C3-C2--C7-C6=C5-[Substituent on C5]`\n    where the groups originally on C2 and C7 become side chains on the new backbone.\n\n    Let's identify the parts:\n    *   Substituent on C4 is H.\n    *   Substituent on C5 is a Butyl group.\n    *   The group on C2 is a Methyl group.\n    *   The group on C7 is an Ethyl group.\n\n    Now, let's construct the product:\n    `[H]-C4=C3-C2--C7-C6=C5-[Butyl]`\n\n    Let's flesh this out, adding the side chains to the appropriate atoms:\n    `H-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH=CH-C₄H₉`\n\n    Let's write this more cleanly:\n    `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH=CH-C₄H₉`\n\n4.  **Name the Product Molecule:**\n    Now we need to find the longest carbon chain in the product and name it according to IUPAC rules.\n    `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n     1   2     3        4        5   6     7  8   9  10\n\n    *   The longest chain containing both double bonds has 10 carbons (deca-).\n    *   The double bonds are at positions 1 and 5 (deca-1,5-diene).\n    *   There is a methyl group on carbon 3.\n    *   There is an ethyl group on carbon 4.\n\n    Putting it all together and listing the substituents alphabetically gives the name: **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (Same as B)\n    D) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n\n    Our derived product name matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
