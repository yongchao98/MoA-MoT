    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the populations of different energy levels and temperature is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower state `i` (`N_i`) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the terms for this specific problem:**\n    *   Let the specific energy level in the problem be state `j` and the ground state be state `i`.\n    *   The \"excitation\" can be defined as the ratio `N_j / N_i`.\n    *   The energy difference is given as `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The ratio of statistical weights `g_j / g_i` is a constant for the specific transition in the iron atom, let's call it `C`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:**\n    *   For **star_1** with temperature `T_1`:\n        (Excitation)_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For **star_2** with temperature `T_2`:\n        (Excitation)_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n5.  **Use the information given in the problem:** It is observed that the excitation in star_1 is twice the excitation in star_2.\n    (Excitation)_1 = 2 * (Excitation)_2\n\n6.  **Set up the equation and solve for the temperatures:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the relationship from step 5:\n    C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    The constant `C` (the ratio of statistical weights) cancels out from both sides:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    To solve for `T_1` and `T_2`, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Substitute the numerical values:**\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Now, calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substitute this value back into the equation:\n    (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    This simplifies to:\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The derived equation `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]` matches option B.\n\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]  (Incorrect)\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]     (Correct)\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]     (Incorrect)\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]                  (Incorrect)\n\n<<<B>>>"
