    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents three equivalent protons (3H) that are a singlet (s), meaning they have no adjacent protons to couple with. A 3H singlet around 2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, as found in an acetate (CH₃-C=O). All four given options are acetates, so this signal is consistent with any of them.\n    *   **Proton Count for the Alkene Portion:** The remaining signals are 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), and 1.6 ppm (3H). The total number of protons in the non-acetate part of the molecule is 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons.\n    *   **Propenyl vs. Butenyl:**\n        *   A propenyl group has the formula C₃H₅. This has 5 hydrogen atoms, which matches our proton count.\n        *   A butenyl group has the formula C₄H₇. This has 7 hydrogen atoms, which does not match our proton count.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options A) Cis-butenyl acetate and B) Trans-butenyl acetate. We are left to decide between Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    *   The structure of propenyl acetate is CH₃-CH=CH-O-Ac. The two protons on the double bond (-CH=CH-) are called vinylic protons. The stereochemistry is determined by the coupling constant (J-value) between these two protons.\n    *   The general rules for vinylic coupling constants are:\n        *   **J_trans** (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) is typically large, ranging from **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **J_cis** (protons on the same side of the double bond) is typically smaller, ranging from **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   Let's look at the signals for the vinylic protons:\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is one of the vinylic protons. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the other vinylic proton. The key information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely in the range for a *trans* relationship. This proton is at a high chemical shift because it is attached to the carbon bearing the electronegative oxygen atom (-CH-OAc).\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton. It appears as a doublet of quartets (dq) because it is coupled to the other vinylic proton (giving the doublet, 'd') and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving the quartet, 'q').\n        *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group (CH₃-) attached to the double bond. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** between the vinylic protons is definitive for a **trans** configuration. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
