    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the fundamental concept:** Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. The key factor influencing a planet's density, besides its composition, is gravitational compression. A more massive planet exerts a stronger gravitational force on itself, compressing its material and increasing its overall density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a planet identical to Earth. Its density is Earth's average density, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. We will use this as our reference density, ρ_E.\n        *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given.\n        *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth (e.g., iron, nickel, silicates) but has five times the mass. Because it is much more massive, its self-gravity will be much stronger. This stronger gravity will compress the material far more than in Earth, leading to a significantly higher average density.\n        *   Therefore, Density(c) > Density(a).\n        *   We can estimate the density. For rocky planets, the radius (R) scales roughly with mass (M) as R ∝ M^0.27. Density (ρ) is proportional to M/R³. So, ρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M / M^0.81 = M^0.19. This confirms that as mass increases, density increases.\n        *   For a planet 5 times the mass of Earth, the density would be approximately 5^0.19 ≈ 1.34 times Earth's density. This gives a density of roughly 1.34 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 7.4 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is made of the same material as Earth but is less massive. With weaker self-gravity, it will be less compressed than Earth.\n        *   Therefore, Density(d) < Density(a).\n        *   Using the same scaling law, its density would be approximately (0.5)^0.19 ≈ 0.88 times Earth's density, or about 4.8 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (calculated to be ~7.4 g/cm³)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (calculated to be ~4.8 g/cm³)\n\nComparing the values, the planet in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
