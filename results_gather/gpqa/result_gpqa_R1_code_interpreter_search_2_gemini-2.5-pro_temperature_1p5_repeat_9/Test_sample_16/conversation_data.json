    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    *   Formation: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    *   Dissociation: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Define the Equilibrium Constants:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$, also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the equilibrium for the formation reaction.\n\n    *   $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    We need the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, which is the dissociation constant ($K_d$). It is the inverse of the formation constant.\n\n    *   $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the complex, and let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$ | 0.02 M | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 M | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 M | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the dissociation constant expression.\n\n    *   $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n    *   $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n    Since the value of $K_d$ is very small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can therefore make the approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    *   $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n\n    *   $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    *   $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    *   $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    *   $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option A. The assumption that the pH is ideal simplifies the calculation by allowing the use of the absolute formation constant without considering the pH-dependent speciation of EDTA.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex\nK_formation = 5e10\n\n# The initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The dissociation reaction is [CaY]2- <=> Ca2+ + Y4-\n# The dissociation constant (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_dissociation = 1 / K_formation\n\n# The equilibrium expression is Kd = [Ca2+][Y4-] / [[CaY]2-]\n# Let x be the concentration of Ca2+ at equilibrium.\n# From stoichiometry, [Y4-] = x and [[CaY]2-] = initial_complex_conc - x.\n# So, Kd = x^2 / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n\n# Because Kd is very small, we can approximate (initial_complex_conc - x) with initial_complex_conc.\n# Kd ≈ x^2 / initial_complex_conc\n# x^2 ≈ Kd * initial_complex_conc\nx_squared = K_dissociation * initial_complex_conc\n\n# Solve for x, which is the concentration of Ca2+\nca_ion_conc = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{ca_ion_conc:.1e}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reaction for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$), which is for the reverse reaction:\n$K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe need to consider the dissociation of the complex, so we use the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nLet's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the calcium ions. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nSince $K_d$ is very small, we can assume that the amount of complex that dissociates, x, is negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n$\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n$x^2 \\approx 0.02 \\times (2 \\times 10^{-11})$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This corresponds to option A. The Python code output of `6.3e-07` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
