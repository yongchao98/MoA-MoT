    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State and Operators:**\n    *   The initial state of the system is given by the column vector `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`.\n    *   The operator for observable P is the matrix:\n        ```\n        P = | 0   1/√2  0   |\n            | 1/√2 0   1/√2 |\n            | 0   1/√2  0   |\n        ```\n    *   The operator for observable Q is the matrix:\n        ```\n        Q = | 1  0  0 |\n            | 0  0  0 |\n            | 0  0 -1 |\n        ```\n\n2.  **Normalize the Initial State Vector:**\n    A quantum state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1.\n    *   First, calculate the squared norm (inner product with itself): `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   The norm is the square root of this value: `||ψ|| = √6`.\n    *   The normalized state vector is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Measurement (P=0):**\n    The problem states that the first measurement is of observable P, and the result is 0. We need to find the probability of this event.\n    *   **Find Eigenvalues of P:** The possible outcomes of measuring P are its eigenvalues. We solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n        ```\n        det | -λ    1/√2   0    |\n            | 1/√2  -λ    1/√2  | = 0\n            | 0     1/√2  -λ    |\n        ```\n        This simplifies to `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = 0`.\n        Factoring gives `λ(1 - λ²)=0`, so the eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n    *   **Find the Eigenvector for P=0:** We need the eigenvector `|v_P=0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ=0`. We solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`.\n        ```\n        | 0   1/√2  0   | |x|   |0|\n        | 1/√2 0   1/√2 | |y| = |0|\n        | 0   1/√2  0   | |z|   |0|\n        ```\n        From the first row, `(1/√2)y = 0`, so `y=0`.\n        From the second row, `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, so `x = -z`.\n        The eigenvector is of the form `(x, 0, -x)`. To normalize it, we require `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1`, which gives `2x²=1`, so `x = 1/√2`.\n        The normalized eigenvector for P=0 is `|v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)`.\n    *   **Calculate Probability of P=0:** The probability of measuring P=0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state `|ψ_norm⟩` onto the eigenvector `|v_P=0⟩`.\n        `Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P=0 | ψ_norm⟩|²`\n        `⟨v_P=0 | ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2)*(1, 0, -1) ] ⋅ [ (1/√6)*(-1, 2, 1) ]`\n        `= (1/√12) * [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`.\n        `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`.\n\n4.  **State Collapse:**\n    After measuring P and getting the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\n    *   The new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Measurement (Q=-1):**\n    Now, we measure observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩` and want to find the probability of getting the result -1.\n    *   **Find Eigenvector for Q=-1:** The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. For the eigenvalue `λ=-1`, the eigenvector is `|v_Q=-1⟩ = (0, 0, 1)`.\n    *   **Calculate Probability of Q=-1:** The probability is the squared magnitude of the projection of the new state `|ψ'⟩` onto the eigenvector `|v_Q=-1⟩`.\n        `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨v_Q=-1 | ψ'⟩|²`\n        `⟨v_Q=-1 | ψ'⟩ = [ (0, 0, 1) ] ⋅ [ (1/√2)*(1, 0, -1) ]`\n        `= (1/√2) * [0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)] = -1/√2`.\n        `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Joint Probability:**\n    The probability of the sequence of events (getting P=0 and *then* getting Q=-1) is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n    *   `Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
