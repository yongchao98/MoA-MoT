    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to substitute a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon). Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Reaction:** α-bromination\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH and heated, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate, which then rearranges to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (as a sodium salt initially, then protonated during workup). The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction:** Favorskii rearrangement\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl₂, pyridine\n*   **Reaction:** Carboxylic acid to acyl chloride conversion\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is known for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃\n*   **Reaction:** Selective reduction of an acyl chloride\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. This is equivalent to determining the number of unique proton environments, which would correspond to the number of signals in a high-resolution ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The cyclopentane ring is not planar and undergoes rapid pseudorotation at room temperature. The time-averaged conformation possesses a plane of symmetry (it belongs to the Cₛ point group). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   The carbons C2 and C5 are chemically equivalent.\n*   The carbons C3 and C4 are chemically equivalent.\n\nNow let's count the distinct hydrogen environments:\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique and lies on the symmetry plane. (1 type)\n2.  **C1 proton (-CH-):** This proton is on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It is also unique and lies on the symmetry plane. (1 type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 protons (-CH₂-):** C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic because of their fixed, different spatial relationships to the substituent on C1. The plane of symmetry makes one proton on C2 equivalent to one on C5, and the second proton on C2 equivalent to the second on C5. This results in two distinct sets of protons for the C2/C5 positions. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 protons (-CH₂-):** Similar to the C2/C5 case, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 types)\n\nSumming these up:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 6\nB) 10 (This is the total number of hydrogens, not distinct types)\nC) 8\nD) 7\n\nOur analysis leads to 6, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
