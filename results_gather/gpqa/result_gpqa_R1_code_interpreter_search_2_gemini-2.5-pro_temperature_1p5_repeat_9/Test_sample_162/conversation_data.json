    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical Reactions**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical processes involved. We are dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3), in a strong acid (let's denote it as HA, which provides H⁺ ions).\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water is an equilibrium:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nThis equilibrium is described by the solubility product constant, Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³.\n\nThe strong acid reacts with the hydroxide ions (OH⁻) produced by the dissolution in a neutralization reaction:\nH⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\nBy consuming the OH⁻ ions, the acid shifts the dissolution equilibrium to the right, causing more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n### **2. Define the Goal**\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong acid needed to completely dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total final volume of 100 cm³, and to determine the pH of this final solution. \"Completely dissolving\" means the solution is saturated with the dissolved Fe(OH)3, so the Ksp equilibrium condition is met.\n\n### **3. Necessary Data**\n\n*   **Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 0.1 g\n*   **Total volume of solution:** 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   **Concentration of strong acid:** 0.1 M\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** We need to calculate this. Using atomic masses Fe ≈ 56, O ≈ 16, H ≈ 1 g/mol, the molar mass is 56 + 3*(16 + 1) = 107 g/mol. (Using more precise values like Fe=55.845 gives a very similar result).\n*   **Autoionization constant of water (Kₗ):** At 25°C, Kₗ = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n*   **Solubility product constant (Ksp) for Fe(OH)₃:** This value can vary in literature. The problem's solution will depend on a specific Ksp. Instead of guessing, we can use the provided options to deduce the intended Ksp. We will see that Option C is consistent with a Ksp value of approximately 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶.\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet's assume the correct answer is one of the options and check for consistency. We will test **Option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³)**, as it turns out to be the correct one.\n\n**Step 4.1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\n*   Molar Mass (M) ≈ 107 g/mol\n*   Moles (n) = mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 107 g/mol ≈ 0.0009346 mol\n\n**Step 4.2: Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required.**\nThe total amount of acid added serves two purposes:\n1.  **Reaction:** Neutralize the hydroxide from Fe(OH)₃. Based on the stoichiometry `Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺`, we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   `Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * n = 3 * 0.0009346 mol = 0.0028038 mol`\n2.  **Excess:** Provide the remaining free H⁺ ions that determine the final pH of the solution.\n    *   If the final pH is 2.69 (from Option C), then the final H⁺ concentration is `[H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M`.\n    *   The moles of excess H⁺ in the 0.1 L solution are:\n        `Moles H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺] * V_total = 0.002042 M * 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol`\n\n**Step 4.3: Sum the moles of H⁺.**\n*   `Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)`\n*   `Total Moles H⁺ = 0.0028038 + 0.0002042 = 0.003008 mol`\n\n**Step 4.4: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed.**\n*   `Volume = Total Moles / Molarity`\n*   `Volume = 0.003008 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03008 L`\n*   Convert to cm³: `Volume = 0.03008 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.08 cm³`\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated volume, **30.08 cm³**, and the assumed pH, **2.69**, match Option C (30.09 cm³; pH 2.69) almost perfectly. The minor difference of 0.01 cm³ is due to rounding of atomic masses and physical constants. This confirms that Option C is the correct answer.\n\nWe can quickly verify that the other options are not consistent. For example, for option A (pH 2.04), the calculated volume would be ~37.2 cm³, which does not match the given 28.05 cm³.\n\nFinal verification by running the consistency check for all options with Python:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nmass_FeOH3 = 0.1  # g\nM_FeOH3 = 107.0  # g/mol (using common rounded value)\nV_total = 0.1  # L\nC_acid = 0.1  # M\n\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3 and H+ for reaction\nn_FeOH3 = mass_FeOH3 / M_FeOH3\nH_reacted = 3 * n_FeOH3\n\n# Options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": {\"pH\": 2.04, \"V_cm3\": 28.05},\n    \"B\": {\"pH\": 3.16, \"V_cm3\": 32.14},\n    \"C\": {\"pH\": 2.69, \"V_cm3\": 30.09},\n    \"D\": {\"pH\": 4.94, \"V_cm3\": 20.40},\n}\n\nprint(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve: {n_FeOH3:.6f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of H+ for reaction: {H_reacted:.6f} mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\nfor key, values in options.items():\n    pH = values[\"pH\"]\n    V_acid_cm3 = values[\"V_cm3\"]\n\n    # Calculate required volume based on pH\n    H_final_conc = 10**(-pH)\n    H_excess_moles = H_final_conc * V_total\n    total_H_moles = H_reacted + H_excess_moles\n    V_calc_from_pH_cm3 = (total_H_moles / C_acid) * 1000\n\n    print(f\"Testing Option {key}: (pH = {pH}, V = {V_acid_cm3} cm3)\")\n    print(f\"  Based on pH={pH}, the calculated volume is {V_calc_from_pH_cm3:.2f} cm3.\")\n    print(f\"  Consistency check: Is {V_acid_cm3} ≈ {V_calc_from_pH_cm3:.2f}? {'Yes' if abs(V_acid_cm3 - V_calc_from_pH_cm3) < 0.1 else 'No'}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "An excellent analysis has been performed. The Python code verified the consistency of each option provided in the multiple-choice question.\n\n### Summary of the Analysis:\n\n1.  **Core Reaction:** The problem involves dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong acid. The overall reaction is:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n\n2.  **Moles Calculation:**\n    *   The moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved from 0.1 g are calculated as `0.1 g / 107 g/mol ≈ 0.000935 mol`.\n    *   According to the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to react with each mole of Fe(OH)₃. This amounts to `3 * 0.000935 mol ≈ 0.002804 mol` of H⁺.\n\n3.  **Total Acid Requirement:** The total amount of strong acid added is used for two purposes:\n    *   To provide the `0.002804 mol` of H⁺ for the reaction.\n    *   To provide an excess of H⁺ ions that will remain in the solution, determining its final pH.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check:** The code systematically checked each option:\n    *   For a given `pH`, it calculated the moles of excess H⁺ (`moles = 10⁻pH * V_total`).\n    *   It added this excess to the moles needed for the reaction to get the total moles of H⁺ required.\n    *   It then calculated the volume of 0.1 M acid that would provide this total amount of H⁺ (`Volume = total_moles / 0.1 M`).\n    *   Finally, it compared this calculated volume with the volume given in the option.\n\n### Conclusion from the Code Output:\n\n*   **Option A, B, and D** were shown to be internally inconsistent. The volume calculated based on the given pH did not match the volume provided in the option.\n*   **Option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³)** was found to be consistent. The volume calculated based on a pH of 2.69 was **30.08 cm³**, which is an excellent match for the given volume of **30.09 cm³**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
