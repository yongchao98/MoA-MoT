    "This problem involves determining the energy states of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n`E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n`E_n = n^2 * E`\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are identical fermions (spin-1/2). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by the set of quantum numbers `(n, m_s)`, where `n` is the principal quantum number and `m_s` is the spin quantum number (`+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n\nThis means that for each energy level `E_n`, there are two available states (one spin-up, one spin-down). Thus, each energy level `E_n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy (E_g)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * E`.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_g = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in `n=1`, two particles in `n=2`.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** `n=2`.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** `n=3`.\n\nWe move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level. The new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in `n=1` (Energy: `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n*   One particle in `n=2` (Energy: `1 * E_2 = 4E`)\n*   One particle in `n=3` (Energy: `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3²E) = 9E`)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Excitation 1:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives the first excited state with energy `15E`.\n*   **Excitation 2:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1*E) + (2*4E) + (1*9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Excitation 3:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2*E) + (2*9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Excitation 4:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2*E) + (1*4E) + (1*16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (`15E`, `18E`, `20E`, `22E`, ...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is `18E`.\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is `18E`.\n\nTo confirm the calculations:\n```python\ndef calculate_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state, first excited state,\n    and second excited state for four spin-1/2 particles in a 1D\n    infinite potential well.

    "This problem requires us to apply the principles of quantum mechanics for identical fermions in an infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Energy Levels for a Single Particle**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L` are given by:\n`E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`\nwhere `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem conveniently defines the unit of energy as `E = (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n*   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = E`\n*   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n*   and so on...\n\n**2. Filling the Energy Levels (Pauli Exclusion Principle)**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. The state is defined by the quantum number `n` and the spin `m_s` (`+1/2` or `-1/2`). This means each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\nWe have four particles to place in these energy levels.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels.\n*   We place the first two particles in the `n=1` level. Their total energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * E = 2E`.\n*   We place the next two particles in the `n=2` level. Their total energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we take the system from the ground state and provide the smallest possible amount of energy. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in the `n=1` level (Energy: `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n*   One particle in the `n=2` level (Energy: `1 * E_2 = 4E`)\n*   One particle in the `n=3` level (Energy: `1 * E_3 = 9E`)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. We consider the possible single-particle promotions from the ground state:\n*   **Promotion 1 (already used for 1st excited state):** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Energy change `ΔE = E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E`. Total energy = `10E + 5E = 15E`.\n*   **Promotion 2:** Move one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. This is a higher energy jump.\n    *   New configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Promotion 3:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   New configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Total energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the possible excited state energies (15E, 18E, 22E, etc.), the ground state is 10E, the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Ground State Energy: `10E`\n*   First Excited State Energy: `15E`\n*   Second Excited State Energy: `18E`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
