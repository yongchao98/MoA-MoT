    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin 1/2, so its spin operator is `S`. The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem states `mu (= gamma*Sz)`, which is a slightly ambiguous notation but is standardly interpreted as the vector relation `μ = γS`, which implies the z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B = B * k̂` (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_0 = -μ · B = -γS · B = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (for the spin-up state `|+>_z`) and `-ħ/2` (for the spin-down state `|->_z`). The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`. The lowest energy state corresponds to the spin orientation where the magnetic moment `μ_z` is parallel to `B_z`. This is the spin-up state `|+>_z`, which has `S_z = +ħ/2` and energy `E_+ = -γBħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+>_z`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the New Situation (t ≥ 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field `B' = B * ĵ` (in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n    *   The \"sudden\" change implies that the state of the system does not have time to change. So, the state at `t=0+` is the same as at `t=0-`: `|ψ(t=0)> = |+>_z`.\n    *   For `t ≥ 0`, the new Hamiltonian is `H' = -μ · B' = -γS · (Bĵ) = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with this new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   To calculate the evolution, it's easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H'`, which is the eigenbasis of the `S_y` operator.\n    *   The eigenvectors of `S_y` are `|+>_y` and `|->_y`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of `H'` are `E'_± = -γB(±ħ/2) = ∓γBħ/2`.\n    *   We need to express the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+>_z` in the `S_y` basis. The relationship between the `S_z` and `S_y` bases is:\n        `|+>_z = (1/√2) (|+>_y + |->_y)`\n        `|->_z = (i/√2) (|+>_y - |->_y)`\n    *   So, the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2) (|+>_y + |->_y)`.\n    *   Now, we apply the time evolution operator `U(t) = e^(-iH't/ħ)`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) [ U(t)|+>_y + U(t)|->_y ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(-iE'_+ t/ħ)|+>_y + e^(-iE'_- t/ħ)|->_y ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+>_y + e^(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ)|->_y ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2)|+>_y + e^(-iγBt/2)|->_y ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Moment:**\n    *   The question asks for the oscillation of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. We need to calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   We need to know how the `S_z` operator acts on the `S_y` eigenvectors. From the basis relations, one can derive:\n        `S_z |+>_y = (ħ/2) |->_y`\n        `S_z |->_y = (ħ/2) |+>_y`\n    *   Now we compute the expectation value:\n        `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (1/2) * [ <+|_y e^(-iγBt/2) + <-|_y e^(iγBt/2) ] * S_z * [ |+>_y e^(iγBt/2) + |->_y e^(-iγBt/2) ]`\n    *   Expanding this gives four terms. The non-zero terms are the cross-terms:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (1/2) * [ e^(-iγBt/2)e^(-iγBt/2) <+|_y S_z |->_y + e^(iγBt/2)e^(iγBt/2) <-|_y S_z |+>_y ]`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (1/2) * [ e^(-iγBt) <+|_y (ħ/2) |+>_y + e^(iγBt) <-|_y (ħ/2) |->_y ]`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (1/2) * [ e^(-iγBt) (ħ/2) + e^(iγBt) (ħ/2) ]`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/4) * [ e^(iγBt) + e^(-iγBt) ]`\n    *   Using Euler's formula, `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2`, we get:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A function of the form `cos(ωt)` has an angular frequency of `ω`.\n    *   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`.\n\nAlternative Method (Larmor Precession):\nThe equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<s>` in a magnetic field `B` is `d<s>/dt = γ (<s> x B)`. This describes the precession of the spin vector `<s>` around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\nIn this problem, the initial spin is along the Z-axis, `<S(0)> = (0, 0, ħ/2)`, and the magnetic field is along the Y-axis, `B = (0, B, 0)`. The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane. Its projection onto the Z-axis, `<S_z>`, will oscillate between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The frequency of this precession, and therefore the frequency of the oscillation of its components, is the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
