    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($ \\pi^+ $) into a positive muon ($ \\mu^+ $) and a muon neutrino ($ \\nu $). The decay process is:\n$ \\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ + \\nu $\n\nWe need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to solve this. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass energy of the pion ($ m_\\pi c^2 $) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of the muon ($ m_\\mu c^2 $) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass, so we'll assume the rest mass of the neutrino ($ m_\\nu $) is 0.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   Initial energy ($ E_{initial} $): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n        $ E_{initial} = m_\\pi c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} $\n    *   Final energy ($ E_{final} $): The total energy of the products is the sum of their individual total energies.\n        $ E_{final} = E_\\mu + E_\\nu $\n    *   Therefore: $ m_\\pi c^2 = E_\\mu + E_\\nu $ (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   Initial momentum ($ \\vec{p}_{initial} $): Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n        $ \\vec{p}_{initial} = 0 $\n    *   Final momentum ($ \\vec{p}_{final} $): This is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon and the neutrino.\n        $ \\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_\\mu + \\vec{p}_\\nu $\n    *   Therefore: $ 0 = \\vec{p}_\\mu + \\vec{p}_\\nu $\n        This implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        $ |\\vec{p}_\\mu| = |\\vec{p}_\\nu| = p $ (Equation 2)\n\n**3. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n$ E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 $\n\n*   For the **muon** ($ \\mu^+ $):\n    $ E_\\mu^2 = (p_\\mu c)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2 $ (Equation 3)\n*   For the **neutrino** ($ \\nu $), assuming its rest mass is zero ($ m_\\nu = 0 $):\n    $ E_\\nu^2 = (p_\\nu c)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_\\nu = p_\\nu c = pc $\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy ($ KE_\\nu = E_\\nu $).\n\n**4. Solve for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations to solve.\n\n1.  From the conservation of energy (Equation 1) and our finding for the neutrino's energy:\n    $ E_\\nu = m_\\pi c^2 - E_\\mu $\n    Since $ E_\\nu = pc $, we can write:\n    $ pc = m_\\pi c^2 - E_\\mu $\n\n2.  Now substitute this expression for $ pc $ into the energy-momentum relation for the muon (Equation 3):\n    $ E_\\mu^2 = (m_\\pi c^2 - E_\\mu)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2 $\n\n3.  Expand the squared term:\n    $ E_\\mu^2 = (m_\\pi c^2)^2 - 2(m_\\pi c^2)E_\\mu + E_\\mu^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2 $\n\n4.  The $ E_\\mu^2 $ terms on both sides cancel out. Rearrange the equation to solve for the total energy of the muon ($ E_\\mu $):\n    $ 2(m_\\pi c^2)E_\\mu = (m_ \\pi c^2)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2 $\n    $ E_\\mu = \\frac{(m_\\pi c^2)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2}{2(m_\\pi c^2)} $\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values to find the kinetic energies.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# From energy conservation, the total energy of the neutrino is E_nu = E_pi - E_mu\n# Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy equals its total energy.\nKE_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execution_outputs>\nKinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu): 29.78 MeV\n</execution_outputs>\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino.
