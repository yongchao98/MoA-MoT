    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State**\n\nThe system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p-orbital).\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p-orbital).\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\nThis means the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators $L^2$ and $L_z$. A measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar = -\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and Final State**\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of making a measurement on the individual electrons and finding:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis measurement outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n**3. Relate the Initial and Final States to Find the Probability**\n\nAccording to the principles of quantum mechanics (Born's rule), the probability of finding a system, initially in state $|\\Psi_{initial}>$, in a final state $|\\Psi_{final}>$ after a measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n$P = |<\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}>|^2$.\n\nIn our case:\n*   $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n*   $|\\Psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n\nSo, the probability is:\n$P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n**4. Use the Properties of Angular Momentum Addition (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients)**\n\nThe inner product term $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are used to express a coupled state as a linear combination of uncoupled states.\n\nA fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are only non-zero if the z-component quantum numbers add up correctly. That is:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check this rule for our specific case:\n*   From the initial state, $m = -1$.\n*   From the final (measured) state, $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nSo, we check if $m = m_1 + m_2$:\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is **not satisfied**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBecause the selection rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n$<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nThis result makes physical sense. The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. It is impossible to measure the individual components and find a result where their sum is $-2\\hbar$, as this would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum for the isolated system. The state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ is a superposition of states where $m_1+m_2 = -1$ (specifically, the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1\\rangle$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0\\rangle$), but it has no component corresponding to the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
