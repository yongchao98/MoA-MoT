    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gaseous mixture is passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in the tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states its weight did not change, which means no CO₂ (or other acidic gases) was produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all the tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nThe gases produced (H₂O, O₂, and C) must be composed of elements from the original salts A and B. Since the process occurs \"without air,\" we know the elements are not from the atmosphere. The elements we've identified so far are H and O. Gas C must be an inert gas that does not react with any of the tubes. Given that we are decomposing salts, the most likely candidate for an inert gaseous product is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂. Now we can determine the complete elemental makeup of the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** from 0.2 mol H₂O → 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol H atoms.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** from 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.025 mol O₂ → (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O atoms.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** from 0.1 mol N₂ → 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol N atoms.\n\nLet's check the total mass to verify our calculations:\n*   Mass H = 0.4 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g\n*   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Mass N = 0.2 mol × 14.01 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 4.00 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe original salts are composed of N, H, and O. They must be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts with oxygen-containing anions of nitrogen, like nitrate (NO₃⁻) or nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's examine their decomposition reactions:\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** This decomposition can be complex. The typical reaction produces N₂O, but at higher temperatures (around 250-300 °C), it can decompose as follows: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet's assume Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃. The mixture is equimolar, so let 'x' be the number of moles of each salt.\n\n*   Decomposition of x mol of NH₄NO₂ produces: `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of x mol of NH₄NO₃ (using the second reaction): To simplify, 1 mol NH₄NO₃ produces 1 mol N₂, 0.5 mol O₂, and 2 mol H₂O. So, x mol NH₄NO₃ produces `x` mol N₂, `0.5x` mol O₂, and `2x` mol H₂O.\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   Total Moles N₂ = x (from A) + x (from B) = 2x\n*   Total Moles O₂ = 0 (from A) + 0.5x (from B) = 0.5x\n*   Total Moles H₂O = 2x (from A) + 2x (from B) = 4x\n\nWe can equate these expressions with the moles we calculated experimentally:\n*   2x = 0.1 mol N₂  ⇒ x = 0.05 mol\n*   0.5x = 0.025 mol O₂ ⇒ x = 0.05 mol\n*   4x = 0.2 mol H₂O  ⇒ x = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield x = 0.05 mol, which strongly confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses (for verification)\nN = 14.007\nH = 1.008\nO = 15.999\n\n# --- Product Analysis ---\nmass_h2o = 3.60\nmoles_h2o = mass_h2o / (2 * H + O)  # Approx 0.2 mol\n\nmass_O_increase = 0.80\nmoles_o2_gas = (mass_O_increase / O) / 2 # Approx 0.025 mol\n\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C / 22.4 # 0.1 mol, assumed to be N2\n\n# --- Check Mass Balance ---\n# Moles of each element in the initial mixture\nmoles_H = 2 * moles_h2o\nmoles_N = 2 * moles_gas_C\nmoles_O = moles_h2o + 2 * moles_o2_gas\n# Calculated total mass\ncalculated_mass = moles_H * H + moles_N * N + moles_O * O\n# This calculation confirms the total mass is ~7.20 g\n\n# --- Final Calculation ---\n# Salt A is NH4NO2\natoms_in_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n# Salt B is NH4NO3\natoms_in_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```",
    "**1. Analysis of Decomposition Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This means the original salts did not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of atomic oxygen (O) is approximately 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identifying the Elements and Salts**\n\n*   The products of the decomposition are H₂O, O₂, and Gas C. The elements involved are therefore H, O, and the constituents of Gas C.\n*   The reaction happens \"without air,\" so the elements must come from the salts A and B. Since H₂O and O₂ are produced from heating salts, a likely candidate for Gas C is nitrogen (N₂), which is a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts and is unreactive towards the reagents in the tubes.\n*   Let's check if the mass adds up. The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.2 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) × 1 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n    *   Mass of O = (0.2 mol H₂O × 16 g/mol) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 32 g/mol) = 3.2 g + 0.8 g = 4.0 g.\n    *   Mass of N (assuming Gas C is N₂) = 0.1 mol N₂ × 28 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n    *   Total Mass = 0.4 g (H) + 4.0 g (O) + 2.8 g (N) = 7.2 g. The mass is perfectly conserved, so our assumptions are correct. The original salts A and B are composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n*   The most common salts containing N, H, and O that decompose upon heating to produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate at ~200-250°C: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). We can simplify this for 1 mole: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + ½O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\n**3. Verifying the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nLet's assume A is NH₄NO₂ and B is NH₄NO₃. The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of each salt.\n\n*   Total moles of N₂ produced = x (from A) + x (from B) = 2x\n*   Total moles of O₂ produced = 0 (from A) + 0.5x (from B) = 0.5x\n*   Total moles of H₂O produced = 2x (from A) + 2x (from B) = 4x\n\nNow we use our calculated moles of products to solve for x:\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol  => x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Check with N₂: 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches our calculation for Gas C.\n*   Check with H₂O: 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This also matches our calculation.\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. Thus, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   N: 2 atoms\n    *   H: 4 atoms\n    *   O: 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   N: 2 atoms\n    *   H: 4 atoms\n    *   O: 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Final calculation to confirm the number of atoms.\n# Salt A is ammonium nitrite, NH4NO2\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO2 = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 8 atoms\natoms_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n\n# Salt B is ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO3 = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 9 atoms\natoms_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n\n# Total number of atoms is the sum\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the detailed step-by-step analysis and the confirmation from the code execution, the total number of atoms in the two salts combined is 17.\n\n-   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** 8 atoms\n-   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** 9 atoms\n-   **Total Atoms:** 8 + 9 = 17\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
