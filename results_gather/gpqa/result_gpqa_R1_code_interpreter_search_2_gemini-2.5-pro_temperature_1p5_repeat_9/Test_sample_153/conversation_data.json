    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires combining information from multiple analytical techniques. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic signature for a compound containing **one chlorine atom** (natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%, ratio ≈ 3:1).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mw(formula_dict):\n    atomic_weights = {'C': 12, 'H': 1, 'O': 16, 'Cl35': 35, 'Cl37': 37}\n    mw_35 = 0\n    mw_37 = 0\n    for atom, count in formula_dict.items():\n        if atom == 'Cl':\n            mw_35 += count * atomic_weights['Cl35']\n            mw_37 += count * atomic_weights['Cl37']\n        else:\n            mw_35 += count * atomic_weights[atom]\n            mw_37 += count * atomic_weights[atom]\n    return mw_35, mw_37\n\n# All options have the formula C7H5ClO2\nformula = {'C': 7, 'H': 5, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 2}\nmw1, mw2 = calculate_mw(formula)\n\nprint(f\"The molecular formula C7H5ClO2 corresponds to m/z values of {mw1} and {mw2}.\")\n```\n```output\nThe molecular formula C7H5ClO2 corresponds to m/z values of 156 and 158.\n```\nAs the code confirms, all the proposed structures have the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) to match the mass spectrometry data (m/z = 156 and 158). Thus, we need to use the other spectral data to differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature and is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **A) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an acid chloride/ester) and option **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde/phenol). We are now left with 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COO**H**). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key here is the splitting pattern. A benzene ring with two substituents that are *para* (at the 1 and 4 positions) to each other results in a symmetrical pattern. The two protons next to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons next to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nCombining all the evidence:\n*   MS shows MW = 156 and one Cl atom.\n*   IR shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted aromatic ring.\n\nOnly **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all these criteria. It has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in the *para* (1,4) positions on a benzene ring. 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) would have a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Therefore, we must use the other spectral data to differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature, often called a \"hairy beard,\" and is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration, also consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **A) Phenyl chloroformate** (an acid chloride/ester, C=O stretch ~1780 cm⁻¹) and option **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (an aldehyde/phenol; would have a phenol O-H peak, but typically less broad, and an aldehyde C=O peak closer to 1700 cm⁻¹). We are now left with B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COO**H**). This strongly confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The key here is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each representing two equivalent protons. This indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. This pattern is classic for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, giving two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted (1,2) ring. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted (1,4) ring. It has a plane of symmetry. This structure would produce exactly the observed NMR pattern: one doublet for the two protons next to the carboxylic acid group and another doublet for the two protons next to the chlorine atom.\n\nCombining all the evidence, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
