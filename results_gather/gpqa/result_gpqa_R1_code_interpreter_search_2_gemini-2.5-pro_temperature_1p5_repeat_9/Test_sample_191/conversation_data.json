    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the setup:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:**\n    *   The presence of the positive charge +q inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To determine the amount of induced charge, we use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero, which implies that the net charge enclosed by the surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed is the sum of the charge +q placed inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   So, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of -q is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   Since a charge of -q has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of +q must be left behind to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor.\n    *   This excess positive charge +q will move to the outer surface of the spherical conductor, as charges in a conductor reside on its surface.\n\n4.  **Electric Field at Point P (Outside the Conductor):**\n    *   The electric field at any point is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges. At point P, the field $\\vec{E}_P$ is the sum of the fields from:\n        1.  The original charge +q inside the cavity.\n        2.  The induced charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity.\n        3.  The induced charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. A conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it.\n    *   The combined electric field produced by the charge +q inside the cavity and the induced charge -q on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is due *only* to the charge +q distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The charge +q on the outer surface is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges inside the cavity by the bulk of the conductor (where the field is zero).\n    *   In the absence of any *external* electric fields, the charge +q on the outer spherical surface will distribute itself uniformly to be in equilibrium.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field:**\n    *   We now need to find the electric field at point P due to a uniform spherical shell of charge +q and radius R.\n    *   According to the shell theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law to a spherical surface of radius L centered at O), the electric field outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is +q.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is L.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius (r), its position (s), the distance from the cavity's center (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) is extraneous for finding the field *outside* the conductor. The principle of electrostatic shielding simplifies the problem significantly. The correct expression for the electric field is solely dependent on the total charge induced on the outer surface (+q) and the distance (L) from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nOur derived formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
