    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Activating, ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   -CH3 (Toluene, 1)\n    *   -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4)\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2)\n*   **Deactivating, ortho, para-directing groups:** Halogens are a special case. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect but are ortho, para-directing due to resonance donation from their lone pairs.\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low and high para-yield groups.**\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups:\n*   **Low para-yield:** The meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will form very little para product. The meta isomer will be the major product.\n*   **High para-yield:** The ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will form significant amounts of the para isomer, along with the ortho isomer.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances with low para-yield (meta-directors).**\nThe substances are 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOC2H5). The amount of ortho and para product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will favor the meta position more strongly, resulting in a lower yield of the para isomer.\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order.\n*   Order of increasing para-yield: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   So, the beginning of our sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances with high para-yield (ortho, para-directors).**\nThe substances are 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), and 3 (-Cl). For these, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product (p/o ratio). This ratio is primarily influenced by two factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The primary factor taught in general organic chemistry is steric hindrance. The incoming electrophile (Br+) is bulky, and attack at the ortho position is sterically hindered by the substituent. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, it will cause more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. So, the para-yield of ethylbenzene (5) should be greater than that of toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine, while being deactivating overall, are known to give a very high para/ortho ratio in electrophilic substitution reactions. This is a well-established experimental fact. The para-isomer is often overwhelmingly the major product. Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest percentage of para-isomer in this group.\n*   Combining these observations, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   The second part of our sequence is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups to get the final order.**\nWe combine the sequence for the meta-directors with the sequence for the ortho, para-directors.\n*   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n*   The complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the result with the given options.**\nLet's check the options provided:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nOur derived order, 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
