    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we need to sum the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE) over all possible states of the system.\nThe energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\nEach spin Si can take values +1 or -1. Thus, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system.\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nWe can systematically list all 8 states, calculate the energy for each state, and then sum the Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list the states (S1, S2, S3) and compute the energy term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each:\n\n1.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.\n    E = -J(3) = -3J.\n\n2.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n3.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n4.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n5.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n6.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n7.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n8.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):**\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    E = -J(3) = -3J.\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy of each level.\n-   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:** This energy occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).

    "The problem asks for the partition function Z of a system with three spins, S1, S2, and S3, where each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, Z = Σ_states e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, let's identify all possible states and their corresponding energies. There are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations of the three spins. We can group these states by the number of +1 spins.\n\nLet's calculate the term X = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each case:\n\n1.  **All spins are the same:**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3. The energy is E = -3J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. The energy is E = -3J.\n    *   There are 2 states with energy E = -3J. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₁ = 2.\n\n2.  **Two spins are the same, one is different:**\n    *   Let's consider two +1 spins and one -1 spin. The possible states are (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, -1): X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. The energy is E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the energy equation, the other two states in this group, (+1, -1, +1) and (-1, +1, +1), will also have the same energy, E = J.\n    *   Now, let's consider one +1 spin and two -1 spins. The possible states are (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   For the state (+1, -1, -1): X = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. The energy is E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   Similarly, the other two states in this group will also have energy E = J.\n    *   In total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states with energy E = J. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe previous Python script execution confirmed these degeneracies and energy levels:\n*   Energy E = -3J has a degeneracy (g₁) of 2.\n*   Energy E = J has a degeneracy (g₂) of 6.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function Z by summing the contributions from each energy level:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
