    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The reaction is: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`.\n    *   This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   The mechanism involves two main steps:\n        1.  The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        2.  This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final product, a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Reagent 'A' must be the source of the proton (H⁺). In aqueous solutions, a proton source is represented as H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion). Therefore, 'A' is H₃O⁺, which signifies an acidic workup or an acidic medium. The other option for A, NaHSO₃, is typically used for the purification of aldehydes and some ketones by forming a crystalline adduct, not for cyanohydrin formation in this context.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The reaction is: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`.\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions, typically with heating. The presence of `B (H₂O)` indicates that 'B' is the reagent that facilitates the hydrolysis in water.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for 'B':\n        *   HCl (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid and is a very common and effective reagent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   CH₃COOH (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might facilitate the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent 'B' for this transformation is HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
