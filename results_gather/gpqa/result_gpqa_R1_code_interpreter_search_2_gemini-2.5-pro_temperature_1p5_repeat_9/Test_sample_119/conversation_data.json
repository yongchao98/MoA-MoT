    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax and the parallax itself.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This translates to a constant number density of stars in three-dimensional space. Let's call this constant density `ρ` (stars per unit volume, e.g., stars/parsec³).\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** The number of stars `N` within a given volume `V` is simply the product of the density and the volume:\n    `N = ρ * V`\n\n3.  **Consider a Shell of Stars:** We are interested in how the number of stars changes with parallax. Parallax is related to distance. Therefore, let's consider the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of space.\n    *   Let the shell be at a distance `d` from the observer.\n    *   Let the thickness of this shell be `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell `dV` can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Area of sphere of radius d) * (thickness dd)`\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars `dN` within this thin shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). The standard formula is:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    (where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n6.  **Relate Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to express the thickness of the shell `dd` in terms of a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of the distance-parallax relation with respect to parallax:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1 / plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    So, `dd = (-1 / plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a shell of a certain thickness (a positive quantity), we can consider the magnitude:\n    `|dd| = (1 / plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Star Count Equation:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`, the number of stars in the shell:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * |dd|`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1 / plx)² * (1 / plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:** Combine the terms involving parallax:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1 / plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n9.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can rearrange to find this:\n    `dN / |d(plx)| = ρ * 4π * (1 / plx⁴)`\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The term `ρ * 4π` is a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN / d(plx)`) is directly proportional to `1 / plx⁴`.\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax ~ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
