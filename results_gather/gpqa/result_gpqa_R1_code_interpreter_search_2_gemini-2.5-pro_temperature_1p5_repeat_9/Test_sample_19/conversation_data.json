    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Impulse Approximation:** The impulse approximation is a fundamental concept used to simplify calculations of interactions with atomic nuclei. The core idea is that if a high-energy projectile interacts with a nucleus, the interaction happens with a single nucleon (a proton or a neutron) inside the nucleus. This interaction is assumed to occur so rapidly (like an \"impulse\") that for the brief moment of the collision, the struck nucleon can be treated as if it were a free particle, completely independent of the other nucleons and the nuclear potential that binds it.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Assumption:**\n\n    *   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n        This is the most fundamental part of the impulse approximation. It posits that the interaction is not with the nucleus as a whole, nor with clusters of nucleons, nor with the messenger particles (mesons) that mediate the nuclear force. The probe \"picks out\" one nucleon to interact with. This is sometimes called the \"single-nucleon approximation\" and is a prerequisite for the impulse approximation. So, statement 1 is essential.\n\n    *   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n        This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. It means that the incoming probe particle and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and/or the ejected nucleon) do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons. If they did, these \"initial state interactions\" (ISI) and \"final state interactions\" (FSI) would complicate the process significantly, and the clean picture of a single, isolated interaction would be lost. The energy and momentum transferred wouldn't be solely due to the primary collision. While more sophisticated models can account for FSI, the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA) relies on this assumption of transparency. Thus, statement 2 is also a key component.\n\n    *   **3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n        This statement concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is a model at the scale of nucleons within a nucleus. It is largely agnostic about what happens *inside* the nucleon. In fact, many experiments where the impulse approximation is used, such as deep inelastic scattering, probe the nucleon at very high energies where the quarks behave relativistically (as described by the parton model). Therefore, this assumption is not a general requirement for the impulse approximation; it might be a feature of a specific low-energy model of the nucleon, but it is not part of the impulse approximation framework itself.\n\n    *   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n        This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The collision is assumed to be so fast that the binding forces, which act over longer timescales, are \"frozen\" during the interaction. The struck nucleon's dynamics are governed only by its momentum at the instant of the collision, and the nuclear potential that binds it is neglected for the purpose of calculating the interaction cross-section. The binding energy only comes into play when determining the initial state of the nucleon before the collision and the state of the residual nucleus after. This statement is a direct definition of treating the nucleon as \"free\" during the interaction. Hence, statement 4 is essential.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the results:**\n    *   Assumption 1 is required to isolate the interaction on a single nucleon.\n    *   Assumption 2 is required to ensure the particles entering and leaving the interaction do so without further complication from the rest of the nucleus.\n    *   Assumption 3 is not required and is often contrary to the physical regime where the impulse approximation is used.\n    *   Assumption 4 is required as it is the central idea of the \"impulse\"â€”neglecting the binding forces during the brief interaction time.\n\n    Therefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n4.  **Match with the given options:** The combination (1, 2, 4) corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
