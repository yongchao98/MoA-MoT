    "This problem involves the physics of radioactive decay, which is mathematically described by an exponential distribution. A key feature of the exponential distribution is its \"memoryless\" property.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay Process:**\n    Let `T` be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom. Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (i.e., it survives past time `t`) is given by the survival function:\n    `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n    `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    Using the formula from step 1:\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Solving for the exponential term:\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    We don't need to solve for `λ` explicitly yet. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    Let `A` be the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. This means it decays between `t=50` and `t=50+150=200`. So, `A` is the event `50 < T ≤ 200`.\n    Let `B` be the event that the atom has survived for 50 minutes. So, `B` is the event `T > 50`.\n    We are looking for the conditional probability `P(A | B)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property (or Conditional Probability Formula):**\n    The memoryless property of the exponential distribution states that the probability of an event happening in the future is independent of how long we have been waiting. In this context:\n    `P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)`\n    This means the probability of surviving an additional time `t`, given it has already survived time `s`, is the same as the probability of a new atom surviving time `t`.\n\n    The probability of *decaying* in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n    So, `P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n    We need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We know from step 2 that `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`. We need to find the value of `e^(-150λ)`.\n    We can write `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    Substituting the value we found:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n    `Probability = 1 - e^(-150λ) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Let's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the problem statement, we derive that e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\n# We need to calculate 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nresult = 1 - (0.68)**1.5\nprint(f\"The probability is: {result}\")\nprint(f\"The probability as a percentage is: {result * 100}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculation shows the probability is approximately 0.439, or 43.9%. This is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning for this problem is based on the \"memoryless\" property of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution.\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):**\n    The probability of decay `P(decay)` in a time interval `t` is given by `P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This equation allows us to characterize the atom's decay rate. We don't need to find the exact value of `λ`, but rather this exponential term.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability that an atom decays in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom \"forgets\" that it has already existed for 50 minutes.\n    Therefore, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to asking, \"What is the probability a brand-new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability for the New Interval:**\n    We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` in terms of the value we found in step 1:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Substitute the value from step 1:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The probability is:\n    `P = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    The Python script calculated this value to be approximately 0.4393.\n    `0.4393 * 100% ≈ 43.93%`\n\nRounding this value to the nearest whole number gives 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
