This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.

    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The objective is to inactivate a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. The most definitive way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that causes the production of a non-functional or completely absent protein.\n\n*   **Understanding Genetic Mutations and their Effects:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A single nucleotide change that results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. This may or may not inactivate the protein. The protein is still produced at full length.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A single nucleotide change that results in a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA in DNA). This causes translation to halt, producing a truncated (shortened) and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the reading frame, altering all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to inactivate the protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of nucleotides in a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Intact Gene and the Mutants:**\n    The intact gene begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`.\n    *   `ATG` is the start codon (Methionine).\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine.\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine.\n\n    Let's examine the change in each mutant at the third codon (`CTC`):\n\n    1.  **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Intact: `...TTT CTC GCT...`\n        *   Mutant: `...TTC TAC GCT...` (based on the pattern, the most likely intended simple change is `CTC` -> `TAC`)\n        *   `TAC` codes for Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). It might not be sufficient to knock out the protein's function.\n\n    2.  **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Intact: `...TTT CTC GCT...`\n        *   Mutant: `...TTC TAA GCT...` (based on the pattern, the most likely intended simple change is `CTC` -> `TAA`)\n        *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause the ribosome to terminate translation at this point, creating a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Methionine-Phenylalanine). This protein will be completely non-functional.\n\n    3.  **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Intact: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant: `...TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n        *   This appears to have two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine) and `ACT` (Threonine) -> `GTC` (Valine). While two changes are more likely to be disruptive than one, it still produces a full-length protein that might retain some or all of its function.\n\n    4.  **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Intact: `...GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant: `...GCT --- ACT...`\n        *   The codon `GGT` (coding for Glycine) is deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid. The rest of the protein is synthesized correctly. This is less likely to be completely inactivating than a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The most effective mutation for eliminating the function of the protein is the one that prevents its complete synthesis. The **nonsense mutation** in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
