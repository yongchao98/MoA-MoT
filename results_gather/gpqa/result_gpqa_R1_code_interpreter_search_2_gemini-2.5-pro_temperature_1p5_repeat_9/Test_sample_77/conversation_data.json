    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the given quantities:\n*   `q`: the charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: the trajectory of the charge, its position vector at time t.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: the time of observation.\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the time at which the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n*   $\\vec{d}$: the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `tr` to the observation point `r`. So, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$.\n*   `d`: the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$, i.e., $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t)}{dt}|_{t=tr}$.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$: the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$: the permeability of free space.\n\n### 2. The relationship between observation time and retarded time:\nThe fundamental concept behind retarded potentials is causality. The field at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the state of the source at an earlier time `tr`, such that the signal has just enough time to propagate from the source to the field point. This relationship is given by:\n$t - tr = \\frac{d}{c} \\implies d = c(t - tr)$\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from Maxwell's equations. The standard derivation involves integrating the charge and current densities of a point charge over space, carefully accounting for the fact that the densities must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`, which itself depends on the integration variable.\n\nThe results of this derivation are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nThe subscript \"ret\" signifies that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\nThe term $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, specifically how the \"information\" about the charge is bundled or spread out in time as it propagates towards the observer.\n\nTo match the format in the given options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\nSimilarly, the vector potential is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` to match the options' format:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with the Options:\nLet's compare these derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is incorrect. The potential is the static Coulomb potential (and uses `r`, the distance to the origin, not the charge), and the relation between `A` and `V` is dimensionally flawed.\n*   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. These expressions perfectly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. The sign in the denominator is positive. These are the advanced potentials, which are typically non-physical as they violate causality (the field at time `t` would depend on the source's state at a future time).\n*   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for a point charge (since $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$), the expression for `V` is the static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge in the context of electrodynamics.\n\nTherefore, Option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
