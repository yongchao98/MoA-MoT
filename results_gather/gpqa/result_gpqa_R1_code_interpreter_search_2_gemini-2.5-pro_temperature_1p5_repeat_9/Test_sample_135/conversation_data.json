    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In vector notation, this is `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r` is the radial distance and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   **Volume (V):** The integration is performed over the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   **Integral:** We need to evaluate `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n**2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence of `f`, `∇ ⋅ f`. In spherical coordinates, the divergence formula is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r) + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂/∂θ (sinθ * f_θ) + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂/∂φ (f_φ)`\n\nFor our specific field, `f_r = 1/r^2`, and the other components `f_θ` and `f_φ` are zero. Plugging this in:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2))`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1)`\n\nThe derivative of a constant (1) with respect to `r` is zero.\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis result, `∇ ⋅ f = 0`, is valid for any point where `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin (`r = 0`), the field `f = 1/r^2 * r̂` is infinite, or singular. This means the divergence is not zero everywhere inside our volume of integration. The entire value of the integral must come from this single point at the origin.\n\nThis situation, where the divergence is zero everywhere except at a single point where it's infinite, is described by the Dirac delta function. It is a known result in vector calculus that `∇ ⋅ (r̂ / r^2) = 4πδ(r)`, where `δ(r)` is the 3D Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ(r) dV`\n\nThe property of the Dirac delta function is that its integral over a volume is 1 if the volume contains the origin, and 0 otherwise. Since our sphere of radius `R` is centered at the origin, it contains the point `r=0`.\n`∫_V 4πδ(r) dV = 4π * ∫_V δ(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\n\n**3. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of that field through the closed surface bounding the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n*   **Issue:** The theorem technically requires the field `f` to be well-defined and differentiable everywhere in the volume `V`. Our field has a singularity at `r=0`.\n*   **Solution:** In physics and mathematics, for fields with such point-source singularities, the theorem is applied by evaluating the right-hand side (the surface integral or flux), as this correctly accounts for the source inside the volume.\n\nLet's calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`:\n*   The surface `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   On this surface, the vector field is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   The differential area element `dS` on the surface of a sphere also points radially outward. In spherical coordinates, `dS = R^2 sinθ dθ dφ * r̂`.\n*   Now, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = ( (1/R^2) * r̂ ) ⋅ ( R^2 sinθ dθ dφ * r̂ )`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1` and the `R^2` terms cancel:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sinθ dθ dφ`\n*   Now we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere (θ from 0 to π, and φ from 0 to 2π):\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sinθ dθ dφ`\n*   First, evaluate the inner integral (with respect to θ):\n    `∫_0^π sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]_0^π = (-cos(π)) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n*   Now, evaluate the outer integral (with respect to φ):\n    `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The value of the integral is `4π`. This is a fundamental result, closely related to Gauss's Law in electromagnetism for a point charge.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
