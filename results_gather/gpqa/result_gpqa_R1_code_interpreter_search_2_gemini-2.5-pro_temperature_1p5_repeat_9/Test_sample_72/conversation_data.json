    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, as their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula for the velocity of object 2 ($v_2$) as observed from the reference frame of object 1 ($v_1$) is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} \\approx -0.142857c$\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is $|v_{rel}| \\approx 0.14c$. The negative sign indicates that from the perspective of the faster astronaut (astronaut 1), the slower astronaut (astronaut 2) appears to be moving backward.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy (E) of a single particle is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\gamma mc^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n**1. Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Calculate its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Calculate its energy, $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**2. Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Calculate its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Calculate its energy, $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3}mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**3. Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   Sum the individual energies:\n    $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n    $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n    $E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy: $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
