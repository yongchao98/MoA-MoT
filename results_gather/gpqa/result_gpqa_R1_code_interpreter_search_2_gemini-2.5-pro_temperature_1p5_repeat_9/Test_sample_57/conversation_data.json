    "*   **Analysis of the concept:** The question is about \"regularization at high energies.\" This refers to a set of techniques used in physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), to handle mathematical infinities that arise in calculations. These infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, occur when we consider interactions at very short distances or, equivalently, at very high energies. A theory that \"never requires regularization at high energies\" would be one that is fundamentally free from these UV divergences; its calculations would naturally yield finite results without needing an artificial \"cutoff\" or other mathematical modification.\n\n*   **Option A: Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory describes electricity and magnetism. While it's a classical theory, it has its own high-energy problem. The energy stored in the electric field of a point charge is infinite. This is because the energy density is proportional to the square of the electric field strength (E²), which goes to infinity as the distance from the point charge (r) approaches zero (E ∝ 1/r²). To get a finite self-energy for a charged particle, one has to assume the particle is not a point but has a finite size, which is a form of regularization (introducing a cutoff). Therefore, classical electrodynamics does have a high-energy divergence problem.\n\n*   **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Like other QFTs describing fundamental forces (except gravity), QCD is plagued by UV divergences when calculating quantities beyond the simplest, \"tree-level\" approximations. Loop diagrams in QCD, which represent quantum corrections, involve integrals over all possible particle momenta, and these integrals diverge at high momentum. Regularization and subsequent renormalization are essential, standard procedures to make sense of the theory and extract physical predictions. Therefore, QCD absolutely requires regularization.\n\n*   **Option D: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism and was one of the first successful QFTs. The development of QED was precisely where the problem of UV divergences became critical and where the techniques of regularization and renormalization were first successfully applied. Calculations of quantities like the electron's self-energy and the vacuum polarization lead to divergent integrals. Without regularization, QED would be unable to make its famously precise predictions. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n*   **Option C: Superstring Theory:** This theory is a candidate for a unified theory of everything, including quantum gravity. A key feature and a primary motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be free from UV divergences. In string theory, the fundamental entities are not point particles but one-dimensional strings. Interactions between strings are not localized at a single point in spacetime but are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effect smooths out the interactions at short distances, taming the infinities that plague point-particle theories. Calculations of loop amplitudes in superstring theory have been shown to be UV-finite. Because it is naturally free from these high-energy divergences, it does not require an external regularization procedure.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the given options, QED, QCD, and even classical electrodynamics have pathologies at high energies/short distances that require some form of regularization to be handled. Superstring Theory is specifically constructed in a way that avoids these problems, making it a UV-finite theory.\n\n<<<C>>>"
