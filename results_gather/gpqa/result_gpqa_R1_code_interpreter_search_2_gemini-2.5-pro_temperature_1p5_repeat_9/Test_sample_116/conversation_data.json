    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  The absence of any plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i).\n3.  Axial chirality, which can occur in molecules like substituted biphenyls (atropisomers) where free rotation around a single bond is restricted.\n\nLet's analyze each compound based on these principles.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a derivative of biphenyl, where two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents are located at positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'. These are the \"ortho\" positions relative to the bond connecting the rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The groups at the ortho positions are nitro (-NO2) and methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3). Both of these are large, bulky groups. The presence of bulky groups on all four ortho positions causes significant steric hindrance, which severely restricts the free rotation around the C1-C1' single bond that connects the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality:** Because rotation is hindered, the two rings cannot become coplanar. They are locked in a twisted conformation. This twisted molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. A molecule that is chiral due to hindered rotation about a single bond is called an atropisomer. Since this molecule is chiral, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and will have a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical formula can be written as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). This carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   **Chirality:** Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center (stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is (C6H5)2C=O, also known as diphenyl ketone.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's look for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a C=O group bonded to two identical phenyl rings. If you imagine a plane that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings, this plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Chirality:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is therefore the *trans*-isomer of CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbon atoms in the double bond. This plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Additionally, there is a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality:** The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (has a chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (is achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (is achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
