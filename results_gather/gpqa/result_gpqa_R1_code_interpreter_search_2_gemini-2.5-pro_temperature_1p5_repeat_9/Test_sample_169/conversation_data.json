    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the expectation value of the spin operator in the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`, for an electron in a given spin state `|ψ>`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula:** The expectation value of an operator `A` for a quantum state `|ψ>` is given by the formula:\n    `<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n    This formula ensures that the calculation is correct even if the state vector `|ψ>` is not normalized. The denominator `<ψ|ψ>` serves as the normalization factor.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components:**\n    *   **The State Ket `|ψ>`:** The problem gives the spin state as a column vector `|ψ> = [3i, 4]`.\n    *   **The Operator `S_y`:** The spin operator along the y-direction is `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (hbar) and `σ_y` is the Pauli-Y matrix.\n    *   **The Pauli-Y Matrix `σ_y`:** The problem provides `σ_y` as:\n        ```\n        σ_y = [[0, -i],\n               [i,  0]]\n        ```\n    *   **The State Bra `<ψ|`:** The bra vector `<ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|ψ>`.\n        `|ψ> = [3i, 4]`\n        `Transpose = [[3i], [4]]` (as a column vector)\n        `Conjugate Transpose = [(3i)*, (4)*] = [-3i, 4]` (as a row vector)\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation Step-by-Step:**\n\n    *   **Step 4a: Calculate the denominator `<ψ|ψ>`.**\n        This is the inner product of the state with itself.\n        `<ψ|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]`\n        `<ψ|ψ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n        `<ψ|ψ> = -9i² + 16`\n        Since `i² = -1`:\n        `<ψ|ψ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n    *   **Step 4b: Calculate the term `S_y|ψ>`.**\n        First, substitute the matrix for `σ_y` into the expression for `S_y`.\n        `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n        Now, apply this operator to the ket `|ψ>`.\n        `S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]`\n        Perform the matrix-vector multiplication:\n        `S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]`\n        `S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]`\n        `S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]`\n\n    *   **Step 4c: Calculate the numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`.**\n        Now, multiply the bra `<ψ|` with the result from the previous step.\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]`\n        We can factor out `(ħ/2)`:\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * ([-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3])`\n        Perform the vector-vector multiplication (dot product):\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]`\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]`\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [12(-1) - 12]`\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]`\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [-24]`\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = -12ħ`\n\n    *   **Step 4d: Assemble the final expectation value `<S_y>`.**\n        `<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n        `<S_y> = (-12ħ) / 25`\n        `<S_y> = -12ħ/25`\n\n5.  **Verify with Code (Optional but Recommended):**\n    We can use Python with NumPy to verify the complex algebra and matrix multiplication.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the unnormalized state vector (ket)\npsi_ket = np.array([3j, 4])\n\n# Define the state bra (conjugate transpose of the ket)\npsi_bra = np.conj(psi_ket).T\n\n# Define the Pauli-y matrix\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], \n                    [1j, 0]])\n\n# We want to calculate <psi|S_y|psi> / <psi|psi>\n# where S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y\n# Let's calculate the value and multiply by hbar at the end.\n\n# Numerator: <psi| (0.5 * sigma_y) |psi>\n# First, calculate sigma_y|psi>\nsigma_y_psi = np.dot(sigma_y, psi_ket)\n# Then calculate <psi|sigma_y|psi>\nnumerator_val = np.dot(psi_bra, sigma_y_psi)\n# The full numerator is 0.5 * hbar * numerator_val\n# numerator_val is a complex number, but its real part is the physical value\nnumerator_full = 0.5 * np.real(numerator_val) # This will be a value multiplied by hbar\n\n# Denominator: <psi|psi>\ndenominator_val = np.dot(psi_bra, psi_ket)\n# The denominator is real\ndenominator_full = np.real(denominator_val)\n\n# Expectation value <S_y>\nexpectation_value = numerator_full / denominator_full\n\n# Print the result as a fraction to match the options\nfraction_result = Fraction(expectation_value).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(f\"The expectation value <S_y> is: {fraction_result} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"Numerator: -12\")\nprint(f\"Denominator: 25\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer (fractional form): -12/25 * hbar\")\n\n```\nExecution output:\nThe expectation value <S_y> is: -12/25 * hbar\nNumerator: -12\nDenominator: 25\nFinal Answer (fractional form): -12/25 * hbar\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value is `-12ħ/25`.

    "The goal is to compute the expectation value of the spin operator `S_y` for the given spin state `|ψ>`.\n\n**1. Define the State and the Operator**\n\n*   The given spin state is a vector (ket):\n    `|ψ> = [3i, 4]`\n*   The corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket:\n    `<ψ| = [(3i)*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]`\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction is `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n**2.
