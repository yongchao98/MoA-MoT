    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are *meta* to each other. This 1,3,5-substitution pattern is a key clue for the synthetic strategy.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nA high-yield synthesis requires that the directing effects of the substituents on the ring work in favor of the desired substitution pattern at each step.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider introducing the groups directly onto the benzene ring in different orders.\n\n*   **Path A: Acetyl -> Nitro -> Bromo**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position. This works.\n    3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** In this step, we have two *meta*-directing groups (-COCH3 at 1, -NO2 at 3). Both groups direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This is an excellent example of reinforcing directing effects. This route is chemically sound and leads to the correct isomer. However, the ring is very deactivated by two groups, so the final bromination might require harsh conditions, but it is highly regioselective. This simple 3-step synthesis is not listed as an option, suggesting a more complex route is expected, perhaps one that avoids this potentially low-yield final step.\n\n*   **Path B: Acetyl -> Bromo -> Nitro**\n    1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone.**\n    2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** This works.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ?** Now we have a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at 1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at 3). The directing effects conflict. -COCH3 directs to position 5. -Br directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This reaction would lead to a mixture of isomers (mainly 4-nitro and 6-nitro products), not a high yield of the desired 3-bromo-5-nitro isomer.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nThe options are long, multi-step syntheses involving reactions like reduction of nitro groups (Fe/HCl) and Sandmeyer reactions (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2), which are often used to achieve substitution patterns that are difficult to obtain by direct substitution. The sequence NaNO2/HCl followed by H3PO2 is used to replace an amino group (-NH2) with a hydrogen (-H), a process called deamination.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...` Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, making this reaction impossible or extremely low-yield. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This follows Path B discussed above. Step (iii) results in a mixture of isomers and is therefore not a \"high-yield\" synthesis of the target precursor. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...` This sequence involves nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, then diazotizing and deaminating it to get back to benzene. This is a circular and pointless sequence of steps at the beginning. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.** Standard nitration.\n    2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.** Standard reduction of a nitro group.\n    3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → 3-Aminoacetophenone.** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Aniline is a base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form an anilinium complex (-NH3+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director, forcing the acetyl group to the meta position. This is a clever way to get 3-aminoacetophenone.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Amino-5-bromoacetophenone.** In the presence of the Lewis acid (or the HBr it generates), the amino group is protonated to the ammonium group (-NH3+). Now the ring has two *meta*-directing groups: -COCH3 at position 1 and -NH3+ at position 3. Both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This is another excellent, regioselective step.\n    5.  At this point, we have **3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone**. The acetyl and bromo groups are in the correct 1,3 relationship. To get the final product, we need to replace the amino group at position 3 with a nitro group.\n    6.  The subsequent steps listed are v) Nitration, vi) Diazotization, and vii) Deamination. This sequence is intended to add a *new* nitro group and then *remove* the amino group. If we were to nitrate 3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone, the reaction would be difficult due to the three deactivating groups (after protonation of the amine) and would not place a nitro group in a position that leads to the target after deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere seems to be a flaw in the question's description of the final steps of Option C. The most chemically sound method to convert the intermediate `3-amino-5-bromoacetophenone` to the final product would be a Sandmeyer reaction (diazotization followed by treatment with NaNO2/Cu catalyst) to replace the -NH2 group with an -NO2 group.\n\nHowever, when comparing the options, Option C is the only one that uses a valid and elegant strategy to construct the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern for the key functional groups in its first four steps. The other options fail at much earlier stages due to incorrect regiochemistry or impossible reactions. Therefore, Option C represents the \"best\" synthetic design, despite the apparent error in its concluding steps. It is the most plausible choice among the given options for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
