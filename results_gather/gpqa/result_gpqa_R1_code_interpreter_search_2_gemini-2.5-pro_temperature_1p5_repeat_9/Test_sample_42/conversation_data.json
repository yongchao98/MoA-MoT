    "This problem requires the systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom to which the -COOH group is attached is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description:\n\n*   **-COOH:** At C1.\n*   **Methoxy group (-OCH₃):** Para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is **C4**. So, -OCH₃ is at C4.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) groups:** Ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ occupy positions **C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is which.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl) and Cyano (-CN) groups:** These are at the remaining positions, **C3 and C5**. The description states they are \"meta to one another\". This condition is satisfied: C3 and C5 are meta to C1, and C3 and C5 are meta to each other.\n\n### 3. Use Additional Clues to Refine the Structure\nWe have two more pieces of information to finalize the positions of the substituents:\n*   The methoxy group (at C4) is ortho to the nitrile (-CN). The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with the -CN group being at either C3 or C5.\n*   The alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) is also ortho to the nitrile (-CN). This is the key clue to resolve the ambiguity.\n\nLet's consider the two possible scenarios for the -CN group:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: The -CN group is at C3.**\n    *   For the -OH group to be ortho to -CN (at C3), it must be at C2 or C4.\n    *   We already placed the -OCH₃ group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the **-OH group must be at C2**.\n    *   This forces the **-N(CH₃)₂ group to be at C6** and the **-CHO group to be at C5**.\n    *   **Structure 1:** 1-COOH, 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH₃, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: The -CN group is at C5.**\n    *   For the -OH group to be ortho to -CN (at C5), it must be at C4 or C6.\n    *   We already placed the -OCH₃ group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the **-OH group must be at C6**.\n    *   This forces the **-N(CH₃)₂ group to be at C2** and the **-CHO group to be at C3**.\n    *   **Structure 2:** 1-COOH, 2-N(CH₃)₂, 3-CHO, 4-OCH₃, 5-CN, 6-OH.\n\nBoth structures satisfy all the descriptive conditions. We must now use IUPAC numbering rules to decide between them.\n\n### 4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\nThe goal is to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers). In both scenarios, the substituents are at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Since this locant set is the same for both, we must use the tie-breaker rule: when numbering gives the same locant set, we choose the numbering that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically and see which numbering scheme gives the lower locant at the first point of difference.\n*   The substituents are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nLet's write down the locants for each substituent in alphabetical order for both scenarios:\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   cyano: 3\n    *   dimethylamino: 6\n    *   formyl: 5\n    *   hydroxy: 2\n    *   methoxy: 4\n    *   The locant sequence is **(3, 6, 5, 2, 4)**.\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   cyano: 5\n    *   dimethylamino: 2\n    *   formyl: 3\n    *   hydroxy: 6\n    *   methoxy: 4\n    *   The locant sequence is **(5, 2, 3, 6, 4)**.\n\nNow, we compare the two sequences number by number. The first number in the sequence from Scenario 1 is **3**, while the first number from Scenario 2 is **5**. Since 3 is lower than 5, **Scenario 1 is the correct numbering scheme.**\n\n### 5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name\nUsing the numbering from Scenario 1, we have:\n*   Parent: **benzoic acid**\n*   Substituents and their locants:\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-dimethylamino\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nFinally, we arrange the substituents alphabetically in the name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
