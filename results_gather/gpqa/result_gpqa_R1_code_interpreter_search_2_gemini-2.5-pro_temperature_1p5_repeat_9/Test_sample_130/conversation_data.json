    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the vinylic region (C=C-H).\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). The presence of only two peaks indicates high symmetry.\n    *   These data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-but-2-enedioic acid). It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, consistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a symmetric, cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄).\n\n### **2. Determine the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic reactants typically yield two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The **endo product** is usually the **major product** because it is formed faster (kinetically favored) due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   The **exo product** is usually the **minor product**.\n*   **Product Structure:** The reaction forms a rigid bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Let's identify the different types of protons in the product, keeping in mind the molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    1.  **`H_A`:** The two protons originally from maleic anhydride. They are on the fused anhydride portion of the new structure. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they will be downfield. Expected signal: a **2H singlet** at ~3.5 ppm.\n    2.  **`H_B`:** The two protons on the one-carbon bridge (the original CH₂ group from the cyclopentadiene). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Expected signal: a **2H singlet** at ~1.5 ppm.\n    3.  **`Me_C` (Vinylic Methyls):** The two methyl groups attached to the newly formed double bond (from C2 and C3 of the diene). Symmetry makes them equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet** at ~1.7 ppm.\n    4.  **`Me_D` (Bridgehead Methyls):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (from C1 and C4 of the diene). Symmetry makes them equivalent. Expected signal: a **6H singlet** at ~1.0 ppm.\n\n### **3. Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\nThe NOESY experiment shows which protons are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). The key information is a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**. This allows us to distinguish between the *endo* and *exo* structures.\n\n*   **Major Product (Endo Isomer):** In the *endo* orientation, the anhydride part of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the new double bond.\n    *   This brings the anhydride protons (`H_A`) close to the vinylic methyl groups (`Me_C`). **An NOE cross-peak between `H_A` and `Me_C` is expected.**\n    *   The anhydride protons (`H_A`) are far from the bridge CH₂ protons (`H_B`).\n\n*   **Minor Product (Exo Isomer):** In the *exo* orientation, the anhydride part is pointing away from the double bond and is on the same side as the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   This makes the anhydride protons (`H_A`) far from the vinylic methyls (`Me_C`). **No NOE cross-peak is expected between `H_A` and `Me_C`.**\n    *   Instead, the anhydride protons (`H_A`) are now close to the bridge CH₂ protons (`H_B`). An NOE would be expected here.\n\n### **4. Identify the Cross-Peak**\n\nThe cross-peak that is unique to the major (*endo*) product is the one resulting from the spatial proximity between the anhydride protons (`H_A`) and the vinylic methyl groups (`Me_C`).\n\n*   Protons involved: `H_A` and `Me_C`.\n*   Signal for `H_A`: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   Signal for `Me_C`: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nNow we check which option matches this pair of resonances.\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> Incorrect protons and multiplicity.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> This is a Me-Me interaction, not the distinguishing one.\n*   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> This corresponds to an (`H_B`, `H_A`) interaction, which is characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product.\n*   D) A **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** and a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** -> This perfectly matches our identified signals for `Me_C` and `H_A`, which show an NOE cross-peak specifically in the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
