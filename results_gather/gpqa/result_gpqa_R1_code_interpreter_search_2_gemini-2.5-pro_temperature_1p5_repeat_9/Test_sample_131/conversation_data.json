    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the molecular formula C10H14.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2 + 4(CH3) = C10H14.\n        *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4 + 2(C2H5) = C10H14.\n    *   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of two of these compounds.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n        *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound:** The key to solving this problem is to understand how the symmetry of each molecule affects the number of unique proton signals.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two planes of symmetry perpendicular to the ring.\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n        *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H). (Note: Equivalent protons do not split each other).\n        *   **Aliphatic protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two distinct singlets**, one for the C1/C4 methyls (6H) and one for the C2/C3 methyls (6H).\n        *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each, ratio 1:1).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has no symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This will result in **two singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n        *   **Aliphatic protons:** All four methyl groups are in different chemical environments. This will result in **four distinct singlets** (each integrating to 3H).\n        *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic protons:** All four protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   **Aliphatic protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling. The CH2 groups will be a quartet (4H) and the CH3 groups will be a triplet (6H). The problem states all signals are singlets, so this compound can be **eliminated**. This rules out option C.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the remaining options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n    We are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n    *   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n    *   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\n    Let's test the possible combinations from the options:\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives 1 singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives 2 singlets. Total = **3 singlets**. This does not match.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (from 2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (from 2H). Combined, this gives **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the integrals will be in a 2H:2H or **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n        *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (from 12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (each from 6H). Combined, this gives **three singlets**. The integral ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n        *   This combination is a perfect match.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives 1 singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives 2 singlets. Total = **3 singlets**. This does not match.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
