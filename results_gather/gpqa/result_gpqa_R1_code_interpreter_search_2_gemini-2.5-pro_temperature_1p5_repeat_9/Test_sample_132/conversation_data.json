    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of the concentrations of various species in a phosphate buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n*   The solution is made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- ions. H2PO4- is dihydrogen phosphate.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2- ions, and 2 water molecules. HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate.\n*   The solution contains a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), forming a buffer solution.\n*   We are asked to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Equilibria**\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps and corresponding acid dissociation constants (Ka):\n*   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n*   **H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-** (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)  -> This is the primary equilibrium that determines the pH of our buffer.\n*   **HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-** (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)  -> This equilibrium governs the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\n**3. Calculate the Initial Molar Concentrations**\nFirst, we calculate the moles of each compound and then their concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   **Moles of KH2PO4 (source of H2PO4-)**:\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Concentration of H2PO4-**:\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (source of HPO4^2-)**:\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO4^2-**:\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe pH (and thus [H+]) of the buffer is determined by the Ka2 equilibrium. We can use the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\nSince the dissociation is small, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- with their initial concentrations.\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (1.308)\n[H+] = 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\nNow, we use the equilibrium for the third dissociation (Ka3) to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nRearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nAgain, we use the calculated [H+] and the initial concentration of HPO4^2- (as its concentration is not significantly changed by this very weak dissociation).\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / (8.11 x 10^-8 M))\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (3.464 x 10^5)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.235 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is very close to 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nTo confirm with a script:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99 # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\n# Ka values\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Moles\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Concentrations\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 1: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_concentration = ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\npo4_3_minus_concentration = ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / h_plus_concentration)\n\nprint(f\"{po4_3_minus_concentration:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution of the script yields:\n```\n6.24e-07\n```\n\nFinal Answer: The concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10^-7 M. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution. We can solve this step-by-step.\n\n**1. Identify the components of the solution:**\n*   The solution contains KH₂PO₄, which dissociates into K⁺ and the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   The solution also contains Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, which dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and the conjugate base HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate).\n*   Together, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ form a buffer solution.\n\n**2. The relevant chemical equilibria:**\nThe phosphoric acid system has three dissociation steps:\n1.  H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka₁ = 7.5 x 10⁻³)\n2.  H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n3.
