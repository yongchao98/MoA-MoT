    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a variation of the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which performs alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is an excellent nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a sequential alkylation followed by an intramolecular cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups. This forms a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH( (CH2)5-Br )-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the newly substituted alpha-carbon, which is still acidic.\n        NC-CH( (CH2)5-Br )-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C( (CH2)5-Br )-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Determining the Number of 1H NMR Signals for Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n1.  **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. The time-averaged structure has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4 of the ring and also contains the C-CN and C-COOEt bonds. Due to this plane, the molecule is achiral. This plane of symmetry has important consequences for the equivalence of protons:\n    *   It makes carbon C2 equivalent to C6.\n    *   It makes carbon C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   The ethyl group, C4, and the CN group all lie on this plane.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:** We need to count the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-CH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH2-) are enantiotopic. They are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. In an achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous). They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 protons in total):**\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions (4 protons):** C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. The two geminal protons on C2 (the axial and equatorial protons) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and have different spatial relationships to the rest of the molecule. Thus, they are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons at these positions (one signal for H-2ax/H-6ax and another for H-2eq/H-6eq).\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions (4 protons):** Similar to the C2/C6 positions, C3 and C5 are equivalent. The geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This results in another **2 signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n        *   **C4 position (2 protons):** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two paths leading from C4 back to C1 (C4-C3-C2-C1 and C4-C5-C6-C1) are mirror images of each other, making them enantiotopic groups. A carbon atom bonded to two identical groups (H, H) and two enantiotopic groups is called a pseudoasymmetric center. Geminal protons on such a center are diastereotopic. Therefore, the two protons on C4 are chemically distinct and give **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n    *   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\n<<<B>>>"
