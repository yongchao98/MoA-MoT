    "*   **Step 1: Understand the relationship between absorbed and emitted light.**\n    When a molecule, such as a textile dye, interacts with light, it can absorb a photon and jump to an excited electronic state. From this excited state, it can relax back to the ground state by emitting a photon. This emission is called fluorescence. Due to energy loss through non-radiative processes (like vibrational relaxation) in the excited state, the emitted photon always has lower energy than the absorbed photon. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n    Therefore, the energy of absorbed light (E_absorbed) must be greater than the energy of emitted light (E_emitted).\n    *   E_absorbed > E_emitted\n\n    The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is inverse: E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. This means that if the absorbed energy is higher, the absorbed wavelength must be shorter.\n    *   λ_absorbed < λ_emitted\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The problem gives the energy of the emitted light as E_emitted = 2.3393 eV. We can calculate the corresponding wavelength using the convenient formula:\n    λ (in nm) = 1240 / E (in eV)\n\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light in nanometers (nm).\n    # Energy of emitted light, E_emitted = 2.3393 eV\n    # The conversion formula is: Wavelength (nm) = 1240 / Energy (eV)\n    \n    E_emitted = 2.3393\n    wavelength_emitted = 1240 / E_emitted\n    print(wavelength_emitted)\n    ```\n\n    The calculation yields a wavelength of approximately 530.07 nm.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n    A wavelength of ~530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum (approximately 495 nm to 570 nm). So, the dye emits green light.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the color of the absorbed light.**\n    Based on the Stokes shift principle, the dye must absorb light of a shorter wavelength and higher energy than the green light it emits (λ < 530 nm). Let's examine the options:\n\n    *   A) Yellow: Wavelength is ~570-590 nm. This is longer than 530 nm.\n    *   B) Blue: Wavelength is ~450-495 nm. This is shorter than 530 nm.\n    *   C) Violet: Wavelength is ~380-450 nm. This is shorter than 530 nm.\n    *   D) Red: Wavelength is ~620-750 nm. This is longer than 530 nm.\n\n    Both blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths than the emitted green light, so they are both physically possible. However, the absorption and emission spectra of a molecule are often closely related. The absorption peak that leads to fluorescence is typically located at a slightly shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emission peak. An emission at 530 nm (green) is most commonly caused by absorption in the adjacent, higher-energy region, which is the blue part of the spectrum. Absorption of violet light would imply a larger Stokes shift, which is less typical. Therefore, blue is the most plausible color for the absorbed light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
