    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n\n*   **Core structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene` - This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond (between C-3 and C-4). A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond counts as another.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). By IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing this group is C-1. This group contains one C=O double bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) on C-2. This group contains one C=O double bond.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) on C-5. This group contains one C=C double bond.\n\nLet's calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material based on its structural features:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C bond within the ring (`...-3-ene`).\n*   1 for the C=C bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   1 for the C=O bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group.\n**Total IHD of starting material = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and use the IHD formula.\nLet's find the molecular formula of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n```python\n# Let's deduce the molecular formula from the name\n# Core: cyclohex-3-ene (C6 ring with one C=C)\n# Substituents and their positions:\n# 1: -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n# 2: -CHO (formyl)\n# 3: Part of C=C\n# 4: Part of C=C\n# 5: -CH=CH2 (vinyl)\n# 6: Saturated CH2\n\n# Count Carbons (C):\n# Ring = 6\n# COOH = 1\n# CHO = 1\n# Vinyl = 2\n# Total C = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n\n# Count Hydrogens (H):\n# Let's count H on each carbon of the ring skeleton:\n# C1 (with COOH): 1 H (to complete 4 bonds: to C2, C6, COOH group)\n# C2 (with CHO): 1 H (to complete 4 bonds: to C1, C3, CHO group)\n# C3 (double bond): 1 H\n# C4 (double bond): 1 H\n# C5 (with vinyl): 1 H\n# C6 (saturated): 2 H\n# Total H on ring carbons = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7 H\n# Now H on substituent groups:\n# H from COOH = 1 H\n# H from CHO = 1 H\n# H from vinyl (-CH=CH2) = 3 H\n# Total H from groups = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 H\n# Total H = 7 + 5 = 12 H\n\n# Count Oxygens (O):\n# from COOH = 2\n# from CHO = 1\n# Total O = 3\n\n# Molecular formula of starting material: C10H12O3\nC = 10\nH = 12\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1 # (Oxygens do not affect IHD calculation)\nIHD_start = 10 - (12 / 2) + 1\nIHD_start = 10 - 6 + 1\nIHD_start = 5\nprint(f\"Starting material molecular formula: C10H12O3\")\nprint(f\"Starting material IHD: {IHD_start}\")\n```\nThe python calculation confirms the initial IHD is 5.\n\n### **2. Identify the Reaction and Reagents**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red Phosphorus (Red P) and excess Hydroiodic Acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to carry out exhaustive reduction, meaning it reduces most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\nSpecifically, the following reductions will occur:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (`cyclohex-3-ene`) will be reduced to a single bond (`cyclohexane`).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the transformations from step 2 to the starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` at C-1 becomes a `-CH₃` group.\n*   The `-CHO` at C-2 becomes a `-CH₃` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH₂` at C-5 becomes a `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl) group.\n\nThe final product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a substituted cycloalkane.\n*   It has **one ring**.\n*   It has **no double or triple bonds**. All bonds are single bonds.\n\nThe IHD is calculated as the sum of rings and pi bonds.\n*   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n*   IHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product and use the IHD formula.\n*   **Product:** 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane\n*   The base formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For cyclohexane, this is C₆H₁₂.\n*   The total number of carbons is 6 (ring) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (methyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   The molecular formula for a 10-carbon cycloalkane is C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Let's verify this by counting hydrogens on the structure of 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n    *   H on ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H₂), C4(H₂), C5(H), C6(H₂) -> 1+1+2+2+1+2 = 9 H\n    *   H on substituents: CH₃ + CH₃ + C₂H₅ -> 3 + 3 + 5 = 11 H\n    *   Total H = 9 + 11 = 20 H.\n*   The product's molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 0/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 1\nC) 3\nD) 0\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a measure of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\nwhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, X is the number of halogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Core:** `cyclohex-3-ene` is a 6-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group.\n    *   A `formyl` (-CHO) group.\n    *   A `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂) group.\n\nLet's find the molecular formula by summing the atoms:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from -COOH) + 1 (from -CHO) + 2 (from -CH=CH₂) = 10\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (from -COOH) + 1 (from -CHO) = 3\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure.\n    *   C1 (with COOH): 1H\n    *   C2 (with CHO): 1H\n    *   C3 (double bond): 1H\n    *   C4 (double bond): 1H\n    *   C5 (with vinyl): 1H\n    *   C6 (saturated): 2H\n    *   H on substituents: 1H (from -COOH) + 1H (from -CHO) + 3H (from -CH=CH₂) = 5H\n    *   Total H = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 5 = 12H\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe IHD of the starting material can be calculated either from the structure or the formula:\n*   From structure: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) = 5\n*   From formula: IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\nThe reagents are **red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds.\n\nThe following transformations will occur:\n1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n2.  The formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n3.  All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nApplying these reductions to our starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nThe resulting product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product.**\nThe product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n*   It has **one ring**.\n*   It has **zero pi bonds** (no double or triple bonds).\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of rings and pi bonds.\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product and use the IHD formula.\n*   The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A general cycloalkane has the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Number of carbons in the product = 6 (ring) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (methyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
