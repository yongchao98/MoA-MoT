    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The matrix form of the operator $P_z$:\n        $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state of the system, represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for uncertainty:**\n    The uncertainty of an operator $A$, denoted by $\\Delta A$, in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, calculated as $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    To find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we need to calculate the expectation value of $P_z$ ($\\langle P_z \\rangle$) and the expectation value of $P_z^2$ ($\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$).\n\n3.  **Prepare the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:**\n    The bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all the components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real numbers, the conjugate transpose is simply the transpose.\n    $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$\n    First, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right) = \\hbar \\cdot 0 = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    First, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)\\cdot(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Now, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Then, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right) = \\hbar^2 (1/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now we plug the calculated values back into the uncertainty formula:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    Finally, we take the square root to find $\\Delta P_z$:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
