    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define the Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the vacuum chamber. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path related to the electron beam. It describes the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area a target particle presents to the projectile for a collision to occur.\n\n    However, this simple formula assumes the target particles are stationary. This is a crucial point.\n\n3.  **Calculate λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the \"projectiles\" are gas molecules, and the \"targets\" are also gas molecules.\n    *   Since the target gas molecules are also moving randomly, the probability of a collision is higher than if they were stationary. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for this by introducing a factor of `sqrt(2)`.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ1, is for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (σ_gg). A simple hard-sphere model estimates this as σ_gg = πd², where 'd' is the diameter of the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)\n\n4.  **Calculate λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the projectiles are electrons from the high-energy beam (1000 kV), and the targets are the gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light, while the gas molecules at room temperature are moving much, much slower. From the perspective of the ultra-fast electrons, the gas molecules are effectively stationary.\n    *   Therefore, the `sqrt(2)` factor is not needed.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ2, is for an electron hitting a gas molecule (σ_eg). In a simple geometric model, since the electron's size is negligible, the cross-section is determined by the size of the gas molecule target, σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4, where 'r' is the radius and 'd' is the diameter of the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result:**\n    The ratio depends on two factors:\n    *   **The `sqrt(2)` factor (~1.414):** This comes from the fact that the targets for λ1 are moving, which reduces λ1 relative to λ2. This factor alone means λ2 is at least ~1.414 times λ1 (assuming the cross-sections were equal).\n    *   **The cross-section ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):** As estimated in step 4, σ_gg ≈ πd² and σ_eg ≈ πd²/4. This gives a ratio of σ_gg / σ_eg ≈ 4. This means a molecule presents a much larger effective target area to another molecule than to a point-like electron.\n\n    Combining these factors:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ sqrt(2) * 4 = 4√2 ≈ 5.66\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Our analysis shows that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, by a factor of approximately 5.66.\n    Even with the most conservative assumption that the collision cross-sections are equal (σ_gg = σ_eg), we would still have:\n    λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414\n\n    Now let's evaluate the given options:\n    A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  (i.e., 1 < λ2/λ1 < 1.22) -> This is incorrect, as our minimum value for the ratio is ~1.414.\n    B) λ2 < λ1 -> This is incorrect. The electron's mean free path is longer.\n    C) λ2 = λ1 -> This is incorrect.\n    D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (i.e., λ2/λ1 >= 1.22) -> This is correct. Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 (and even our most conservative estimate of ~1.414) is greater than 1.22.\n\nThe physical reason is twofold: an electron is a smaller projectile than a molecule, and more importantly, it collides with effectively stationary targets, unlike a gas molecule that collides with other moving molecules. Both effects increase the mean free path for the electron compared to the gas molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>"
