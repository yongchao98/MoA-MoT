    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n- A is the planet's albedo.\n- R_star is the star's radius.\n- a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\nT_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out when we take the ratio:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n**2. Relate the semi-major axis (a) to the observable quantities.**\n\nWe are given information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max). This Doppler shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it is pulled by the orbiting planet.\n\nThe maximum Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity, also known as the radial velocity amplitude (K), by the Doppler formula:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), and assuming the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on (sin(i) ≈ 1, which is a condition for transit detection), the radial velocity amplitude K is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and v_p is the planet's orbital velocity.\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity for a circular orbit is:\nv_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n(assuming M_p << M_star, which is true in this case).\n\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nNow, we solve this for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star) * (G / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n**3. Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1).**\n\nUsing the formula for 'a' derived above:\na1 ≈ (G * M_p1^2) / (K1^2 * M_star)\na2 ≈ (G * M_p2^2) / (K2^2 * M_star)\n\nNow, we find the ratio a2 / a1. The terms G and M_star are constant and cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (K1^2 * M_star)]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nSince K is directly proportional to Δλ_max (K = c * Δλ_max / λ_0), the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\nK1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\n**4. Substitute the given values and compute the final result.**\n\nThe given values are:\n- Planet1 mass, M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n- Planet2 mass, M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n- Planet1 Doppler shift, Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n- Planet2 Doppler shift, Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (0.03 / 0.04)^2\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\nNow, calculate the temperature ratio using the result from Step 1:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, calculate the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\nratio_a2_a1 = 225 / 784\ntemperature_ratio = math.sqrt(ratio_a2_a1)\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\n> executing code...\n> 0.5357142857142857\n>\n> \n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, A is the planet's albedo, R_star is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * (2 * a2 / R_star) )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1. We can derive this from the information provided by the radial velocity (RV) method. The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) by:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nwhere 'c' is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength. This means K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude is given by:\nK ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_planet is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nLet's solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK^2 ≈ (M_planet^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 ≈ (M_planet^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_planet^2) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The terms G and M_star are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (K1^2 * M_star)]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ_max, the ratio K1 / K2 is the same as the ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n- M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n- M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n- Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n- Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (0.03 / 0.04)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
