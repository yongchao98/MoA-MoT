These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The α-hydrogens between the two ester groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The carbonyl group withdraws electron density, making the β-carbon (the one attached to the p-tolyl group) electrophilic.\n    *   Structure of the acceptor: p-Tolyl-C(β)H=C(α)H-COOCH₃.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1:** The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   **Step 2:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This generates another resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Step 3:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) on its α-carbon to yield the final neutral product (A).\n\n3.  **Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   The final structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in the options: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n        *   The parent chain is \"propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\". We can visualize this by taking a propane chain (C1-C2-C3) and attaching the carboxylate groups: two `COOCH₃` groups at C1 and one `COOCH₃` group at C3. The skeleton would be `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH₂-CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n        *   A \"2-(p-tolyl)\" substituent is added at C2.\n        *   This results in the structure: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   This structure exactly matches the product derived from the reaction mechanism. Thus, A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B:\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Reaction):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is a nitrogen analog of an enolate and serves as a neutral but potent carbon nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). An α,β-unsaturated nitrile with the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CN. The β-carbon (part of `CH₃-CH=`) is electrophilic.\n    *   Structure of the acceptor: CH₃-C(β)H=C(α)H-CN.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile, forming a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position (C2).\n    *   The group added is derived from the acceptor. The bond forms at the β-carbon of the acceptor. After protonation of the α-carbon, the added group is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: 2-[-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN]-cyclohexanone.\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is `NC-C₂H₂-C₃H(CH₃)-C₄`. The substituent at C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product after acidic workup. Thus, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction C:\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns (Retrosynthetic Analysis):**\n    *   This is a \"find the reactant\" problem. We need to work backward from the product.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃. The β-carbon is the terminal `CH₂`. Structure: C(β)H₂=C(α)H-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Catalyst:** KOH, a base to generate the nucleophile from reactant C.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Product:**\n    *   The core is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    *   The substituent is at position C2 (the acidic methylene carbon between the two carbonyls).\n    *   The substituent is a \"3-oxobutyl\" group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n3.  **Reverse the Michael Reaction:**\n    *   The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   In the product, this bond is between C2 of the dione ring (from the donor) and the first `CH₂` of the 3-oxobutyl chain (from the acceptor's β-carbon).\n    *   To find the starting materials, we conceptually break this bond.\n    *   Breaking the bond gives:\n        *   The enolate of the donor: a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a negative charge at C2.\n        *   The acceptor: `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃` (MVK).\n    *   The neutral starting material (C) is formed by protonating the donor enolate.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
