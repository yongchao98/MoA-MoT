    "*   **1. Understanding Equilibrium Temperature:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1-A)}{16\\pi\\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    Where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance).\n\n*   **2. Forming the Ratio of Temperatures:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet 4 ($T_4$) to that of Planet 2 ($T_2$).\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{L(1-A_4)}{16\\pi\\sigma a_4^2} \\right)^{1/4}}{\\left( \\frac{L(1-A_2)}{16\\pi\\sigma a_2^2} \\right)^{1/4}}$\n\n*   **3. Simplifying the Ratio:**\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, the stellar luminosity ($L$) is the same for both. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo ($A_4 = A_2$). All other constants ($16, \\pi, \\sigma$) cancel out.\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{1/a_4^2}{1/a_2^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{a_2^2}{a_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance ($T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$).\n\n*   **4. Relating Orbital Distance to Orbital Period (Kepler's Third Law):**\n    We are not given the orbital distances ($a$), but we are given the ratios of the orbital periods ($P$). Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    Therefore, the ratio of orbital distances can be related to the ratio of orbital periods:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3}$\n\n*   **5. Substituting into the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Now we substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n*   **6. Calculating the Final Value:**\n    The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The period ratio for Planet 2 is 2.\n    *   The period ratio for Planet 4 is 3.5.\n    Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$.\n    Plugging this into our final equation:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    Now, we perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods P_2 / P_4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_4 / T_2 is (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = math.pow(period_ratio, 1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance ($a$):\n$T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 ($T_4$) and Planet 2 ($T_2$) is:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{a_4}{a_2}\\right)^{-1/2} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_4}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nSo, the ratio of the orbital distances can be expressed in terms of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\nFrom this, we have the ratio of the periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
