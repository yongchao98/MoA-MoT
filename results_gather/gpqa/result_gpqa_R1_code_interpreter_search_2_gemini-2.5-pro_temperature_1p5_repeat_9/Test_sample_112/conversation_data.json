    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Vinyl-hydrogen peaks:** The presence of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond. This observation corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common chemical fragment that has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass ≈ (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Formula Determination:**\n    *   From the combined data, we know the molecule must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The presence of the -COOH group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**, also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The formula for a compound CxHyOz is: DoU = x - (y/2) + 1.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (in the carboxyl group) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene part). This means the total degree of unsaturation must be 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For C6H12O2 (Option A):** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. A DoU of 1 is insufficient, as it can only account for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For C6H10O2 (Option B):** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our finding of one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. An example structure would be any hexenoic acid, like 4-hexenoic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data points unequivocally to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The molecular formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains the necessary two oxygen atoms and has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene functional groups.\n\n<<<B>>>"
