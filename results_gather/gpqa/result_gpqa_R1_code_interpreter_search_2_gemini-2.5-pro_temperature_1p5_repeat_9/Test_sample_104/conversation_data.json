    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core task is to compare two phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim: starspots and a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the size of an exoplanet that would produce the same dimming effect as the given starspot configuration.\n\n2.  **Model the Starspot Dimming:**\n    *   The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing us either a \"quiet\" (unspotted) hemisphere or a \"spotted\" one.\n    *   The maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the quiet hemisphere faces the observer.\n    *   The minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer.\n    *   The amplitude of the signal is the relative difference: `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n3.  **Apply Physics - Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The flux (F) or energy radiated per unit area of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T): `F ∝ T^4`.\n    *   Let's consider the projected disk of the star that we see. The area of this disk is A_disk = π * R_star².\n    *   Flux from the quiet side (F_max): The entire disk radiates at the star's effective temperature, T_eff. So, `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff^4`.\n    *   Flux from the spotted side (F_min): This side is a composite. The filling factor `f` (20% or 0.20) tells us what fraction of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots.\n        *   The area of the spots on the visible disk is `A_spot = f * A_disk`. This area radiates at the spot temperature, `T_spot`.\n        *   The area of the normal photosphere on the visible disk is `A_phot = (1 - f) * A_disk`. This area radiates at the star's effective temperature, `T_eff`.\n        *   The total flux from this side is the sum of the two components: `F_min ∝ (A_phot * T_eff^4) + (A_spot * T_spot^4)`.\n        *   Substituting the areas: `F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4] + [f * A_disk * T_spot^4]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Spot-Induced Amplitude:**\n    *   Now, let's put the flux expressions into the amplitude formula. The `A_disk` term will cancel out.\n    *   `Amplitude = ( (A_disk * T_eff^4) - ([(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4] + [f * A_disk * T_spot^4]) ) / (A_disk * T_eff^4)`\n    *   `Amplitude = ( T_eff^4 - (1 - f)T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4 ) / T_eff^4`\n    *   `Amplitude = ( T_eff^4 - T_eff^4 + f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4 ) / T_eff^4`\n    *   `Amplitude = ( f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4 ) / T_eff^4`\n    *   This simplifies to a neat formula: `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`.\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light.\n    *   The depth of this transit (the fractional drop in brightness) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    *   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`.\n\n6.  **Equate the Two Effects and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the amplitude from the spots is the same as the signal from the hypothetical exoplanet.\n    *   Therefore, `Transit Depth = Amplitude`.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`.\n    *   To find the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`, we just need to take the square root of the right side.\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) )`.\n\n7.  **Plug in the Numbers and Compute:**\n    *   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n    *   `f = 0.20`\n    *   It's time for calculation. I can use a Python script to do this accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin (1000K cooler)\nf = 0.20       # Filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots.\n# The formula is A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# For a transiting exoplanet, the transit depth (brightness drop) is (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n# We set the amplitude from the spots equal to the transit depth.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the final numerical value for `R_pl / R_star`. The result `~0.32` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The core of the problem is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl`) relative to its star's radius (`R_star`) that would cause the same drop in brightness as a specific starspot configuration. We need to equate the amplitude of the signal from rotational modulation of spots to the amplitude of a planetary transit.\n\n2.  **Model the Brightness Variation due to Starspots:**\n    *   The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing us either its \"quiet\" (unspotted) hemisphere or its \"spotted\" hemisphere.\n    *   The maximum flux (F_max) we observe is when the quiet hemisphere is facing us. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux radiated is proportional to the projected area (A_star) and the fourth power of the effective temperature (T_eff). So, `F_max ∝ A_star * T_eff^4`.\n    *   The minimum flux (F_min) is observed when the spotted hemisphere faces us. This hemisphere is a composite. A fraction `f` (the filling factor) of its area is covered by cooler spots, and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` has the normal photospheric temperature.\n    *   The flux from the spotted hemisphere is the sum of the flux from the hot part and the cool part: `F_min ∝ [(1-f) * A_star * T_eff^4] + [f * A_star * T_spot^4]`.\n    *   The amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative change in flux: `Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux (the proportional area term `A_star` will cancel out):\n        `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff^4 - [(1-f)T_eff^4 + f*T_spot^4]) / T_eff^4`\n        `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff^4 - T_eff^4 + f*T_eff^4 - f*T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n        `Amplitude_spots = (f*T_eff^4 - f*T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n        `Amplitude_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\n3.  **Model the Brightness Drop due to a Transiting Planet:**\n    *   When an exoplanet passes in front of its star (a transit), it blocks a portion of the star's light.\n    *   The depth of this transit, which is the amplitude of the signal, is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`.\n\n4.  **Equate the two Signals and Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius:**\n    *   The problem requires the signals to have the same amplitude: `Amplitude_spots = Amplitude_planet`.\n    *   `f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4] = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n    *   To find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we take the square root of both sides:\n        `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4])`\n\n5.  **Plug in the Given Values and Calculate:**\n    *   Effective temperature of the star, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   Temperature difference of spots, `ΔT = 1000 K`.\n    *   Temperature of the spots, `T_spot = T_eff - ΔT = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K`.\n    *   Filling factor of spots, `f = 20% = 0.20`.\n    *   Now, we substitute these values into the derived formula. The python code execution performed this calculation precisely.\n\n6.  **Review Code Output:**\n    *   The executed Python code calculated `sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)^4])`.\n    *   The result was `0.32179...`.\n    *   This numerical result is closest to the value in option C.\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots is given by the formula:\nAmplitude_spots = `f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\nwhere `f` is the spot filling factor, `T_spot` is the spot temperature, and `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature.\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness drop caused by a transiting exoplanet is given by the formula:\nAmplitude_planet = `(R_pl / R_star)^2`\nwhere `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\nWe are given that these two amplitudes are equal:\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2` = `f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2` = `0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)^4]`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2` = `0.20 * [1 - (5/6)^4]`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2` = `0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2` = `0.20 * 0.51775`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2` = `0.10355`\n\n`R_pl / R_star` = `sqrt(0.10355)` ≈ `0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>"
