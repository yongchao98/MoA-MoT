All candidate answers correctly identified this formula:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    A key insight, demonstrated by the most accurate candidate answers, is to simplify this complex formula for the specific case of the (111) plane before substituting numerical values. This greatly reduces the chance of calculation errors.\n    *   For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `h² + k² + l² = 3` and `hk + kl + lh = 3`.\n    *   Substituting these values and performing algebraic factorization (as detailed in several candidate answers) simplifies the formula to:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Using the simplified and more robust formula, we substitute the given values:\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`, which means `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n    Now, we solve for `d_111`:\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    Finally, we calculate the numerical value:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**.

All agents did this correctly.\n*   **Formula Simplification:** The most reliable method is to simplify the general formula for the specific Miller indices (111) before plugging in numbers. This minimizes the risk of arithmetic and rounding errors, which was a minor issue for agents who used the full formula with decimal approximations.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** When performing the calculation, it is best to use exact values (like `√3/2`) for as long as possible and only perform the final numerical evaluation at the end. This ensures the highest accuracy.\n*   **Option Matching:** The most significant source of error among the candidate answers was in the final step. While nearly all agents correctly calculated the numerical value to be ~9.54 Å, many selected the wrong letter (A, B, or D). This is likely due to an internal re-ordering of the options during their generation process. The crucial final step is to carefully match the calculated result (9.54 Å) to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\nBased on the overwhelming consensus of the calculation and a careful matching to the provided options, the correct answer is 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the insights from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information and Goal:**\n    The problem asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n    *   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n    *   **Lattice Parameter, `a`:** 10 Angstrom (given as \"interatomic distance\")\n    *   **Interaxial Angles, `α`, `β`, `γ`:** All are 30°\n    *   **Miller Indices, `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:**\n    For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    A crucial step for accuracy and simplicity is to simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane where `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\n    Substituting these values and simplifying the numerator and denominator algebraically (the denominator term `1-3cos²α+2cos³α` factors to `(1-cosα)²(1+2cosα)`) leads to a much more manageable expression:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Using this simplified formula is the most reliable method, as it minimizes the potential for calculation errors.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Now, substitute the given values (`a = 10` Å and `α = 30°`) into the simplified formula. It is best to use the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n    Next, solve for `d_111`:\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    Finally, calculate the numerical value:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205...}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**.

It greatly reduces the chance of arithmetic and rounding errors.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** Using exact values for trigonometric functions (e.g., `√3/2` instead of a rounded decimal like 0.866) until the final step is critical for accuracy.\n*   **Final Answer Matching:** The most common error among the candidate answers was correctly calculating the numerical value (~9.54) but then selecting the wrong lettered option, likely due to working from a shuffled list. It is crucial to match the calculated result to the original list of options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first carefully analyze the problem by identifying the given parameters and the correct physical formula. The candidate answers show a consensus on the formula but differ in their calculation methods and final conclusions. The most reliable method, as pointed out by several agents, is to first simplify the general formula for the specific (111) plane to reduce the risk of calculation errors.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this calculation using the simplified formula to ensure high precision. The script will calculate the interplanar distance and then I will compare this result to the options provided in the original question to determine the correct choice. I will also summarize the key \"careful points\" to consider, which were the main sources of error in the candidate answers.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis and the final Python code:\n\n**1. Identify Crystal System and Parameters:**\n*   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n*   Lattice Parameter `a`: 10 Angstrom\n*   Interaxial Angle `α`: 30°\n*   Miller Indices `(hkl)`: (111)\n\n**2. Select and Simplify the Formula:**\nThe general formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nFor the (111) plane, `h=k=l=1`.

This is the most important piece of information as it dictates which formula to use.\n    *   The \"interatomic distance\" is given as 10 Angstrom. This is interpreted as the lattice parameter, `a`. So, `a = 10` Å.\n    *   The interaxial angles are `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   The Miller indices for the plane of interest are `(hkl) = (111)`.\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:**\n    The formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    A crucial step to ensure accuracy and reduce complexity is to simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane before plugging in numbers.\n    *   For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `h² + k² + l² = 3` and `hk + kl + lh = 3`.\n    *   Substituting these into the general formula and performing algebraic factorization (as correctly done by several of the candidate agents) simplifies the expression significantly. The numerator becomes `3(1 - cosα)²` and the denominator's volume term `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` factors to `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n    *   This leads to the much simpler formula for the (111) plane:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Now, we substitute the given values (`a = 10` Å and `α = 30°`) into the simplified formula.\n    *   We use the exact value for `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`.\n    *   $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n    *   Now, we solve for `d₁₁₁`:\n        $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n        $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    *   To get the numerical value, we use `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n        $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Final Decision:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. We compare this with the given options:\n    A) 10.05 Angstrom\n    B) 9.54 Angstrom\n    C) 8.95 Angstrom\n    D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value of 9.543 Å clearly matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Formula:** It is essential to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral system. Using a formula for a different crystal system (like cubic or tetragonal) would lead to a completely wrong answer.\n2.  **Formula Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111), simplifying the general formula algebraically before substituting numerical values is the most robust method. It significantly reduces the chance of arithmetic and rounding errors.\n3.  **Calculation Precision:** When performing the calculation, it is best to use exact values (like `√3/2`) for as long as possible. Using rounded decimal approximations (like 0.866 for `cos(30°)`) too early can introduce small errors, as seen in some candidate answers.\n4.  **Matching Result to Options:** A final, critical check is to carefully match the calculated numerical result to the provided list of options. The analysis of the candidate answers shows that almost all of them calculated the correct numerical value (~9.54), but many failed to select the correct letter, likely because they were working with a shuffled list of options.

This is the most important piece of information as it dictates which formula to use.\n    *   The \"interatomic distance\" is given as 10 Angstrom. This is interpreted as the lattice parameter, `a`. So, `a = 10` Å.\n    *   The interaxial angles are `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   The Miller indices for the plane of interest are `(hkl) = (111)`.\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:**\n    The formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    A crucial step to ensure accuracy and reduce complexity is to simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane before plugging in numbers.\n    *   For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `h² + k² + l² = 3` and `hk + kl + lh = 3`.\n    *   Substituting these into the general formula and performing algebraic factorization (as correctly done by several of the candidate agents) simplifies the expression significantly. The numerator becomes `3(1 - cosα)²` and the denominator's volume term `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` factors to `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n    *   This leads to the much simpler formula for the (111) plane:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Now, we substitute the given values (`a = 10` Å and `α = 30°`) into the simplified formula.\n    *   We use the exact value for `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`.\n    *   $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n    *   Now, we solve for `d₁₁₁`:\n        $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n        $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    *   To get the numerical value, we use `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n        $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Final Decision:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. We compare this with the given options:\n    A) 10.05 Angstrom\n    B) 9.54 Angstrom\n    C) 8.95 Angstrom\n    D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value of 9.543 Å clearly matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Formula:** It is essential to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral system. Using a formula for a different crystal system (like cubic or tetragonal) would lead to a completely wrong answer.\n2.  **Formula Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111), simplifying the general formula algebraically before substituting numerical values is the most robust method. It significantly reduces the chance of arithmetic and rounding errors.\n3.  **Calculation Precision:** When performing the calculation, it is best to use exact values (like `√3/2`) for as long as possible. Using rounded decimal approximations (like 0.866 for `cos(30°)`) too early can introduce small errors, as seen in some candidate answers.\n4.  **Matching Result to Options:** A final, critical check is to carefully match the calculated numerical result to the provided list of options. The analysis of the candidate answers shows that almost all of them calculated the correct numerical value (~9.54), but many failed to select the correct letter, likely because they were working with a shuffled list of options.

This greatly reduces the chance of calculation and rounding errors.\n    *   For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `h² + k² + l² = 3` and `hk + kl + lh = 3`.\n\n    Substituting these values and performing algebraic factorization (as detailed in several candidate answers) simplifies the general formula to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Using this more robust, simplified formula, we substitute the given values:\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`, which means `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n    Now, we solve for `d_111`:\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n    Finally, we calculate the numerical value, using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. Comparing this with the provided options:\n    *   A) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   B) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   C) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   D) 10.05 Angstrom\n\n    The calculated value of 9.543 Angstrom clearly matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Formula Selection:** It is essential to use the correct formula specifically for the rhombohedral crystal system, as it is distinct from other systems like cubic or tetragonal.\n*   **Formula Simplification:** The most significant source of potential error is in the calculation. For high-symmetry planes like (111), simplifying the general formula algebraically before plugging in numbers is the most reliable method to ensure accuracy and avoid rounding mistakes.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** When performing the calculation, it is best practice to use exact values (like `√3/2`) for as long as possible. Prematurely rounding trigonometric functions to a few decimal places can introduce small errors, as seen in some candidate answers.\n*   **Option Matching:** A major point of failure among the candidate answers was correctly calculating the numerical value (~9.54) but then selecting the wrong lettered option. This was likely caused by the agents working with a shuffled list of options. It is critical to match the final calculated value to the options as they are presented in the original question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
