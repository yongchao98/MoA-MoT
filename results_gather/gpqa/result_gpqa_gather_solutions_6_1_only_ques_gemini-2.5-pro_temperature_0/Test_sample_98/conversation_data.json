  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\nA) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\nB) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\nC) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\nD) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\nThe FTIR data provides information about the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n*   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is a result of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore essential for identification.\n\n### **Step 2: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the two complex splitting patterns described. The correct molecule must contain two different protons, one that gives rise to each of these unique signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex multiplet indicates that a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This indicates a different proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   A second, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now analyze the methine (CH) protons in each of the four structures to see which one contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will use the lettering as provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one C-H and two different -CH₂- groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H) and two different -CH₂- groups (one from the main chain at C4, one from the ethyl substituent). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton adjacent to a C-H, a -CH₂-, and a -CH₃ group. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), the -CH₂- at C2 (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one C-H and two different -CH₂- groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's analyze the two protons on the chiral centers (C3 and C4, numbering from the COOH group as C1).\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The proton on C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The -CH₂- group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The terminal -CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The proton on C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The -CH₂- group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The -CH₂- group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H) → **triplet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  **FTIR Confirmation:** The FTIR data reliably identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid, which is consistent with all four options.\n2.  **NMR as the Key:** The specific isomer can only be identified by analyzing the complex splitting patterns in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n3.  **Simultaneous Requirements:** The correct structure must contain protons that satisfy *both* the `dtq` and `dtt` conditions. It is not enough for a molecule to satisfy only one.\n4.  **Structural Analysis:** By systematically analyzing the neighbors of each methine (CH) proton in all four structures, we find that only structure D has the unique arrangement to produce both required signals. The proton at C4 produces the `dtq` signal, and the proton at C3 produces the `dtt` signal.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The first step is to interpret the FTIR data. A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, with the broadness caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This is a crucial first step, but since all four options are carboxylic acids, this data only confirms the functional group and cannot distinguish between the isomers. The decisive information must come from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n2.  **Deconstruction of ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns:**\n    *   This is the most critical part of the analysis. The correct structure must contain protons that can generate *both* of the complex signals described.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This signal arises from a single proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing the **d**oublet.\n        *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, a -CH₂- group), causing the **t**riplet.\n        *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (n=3, a -CH₃- group), causing the **q**uartet.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This signal arises from a different proton that is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n        *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing the **d**oublet.\n        *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, a -CH₂- group), causing a **t**riplet.\n        *   A second, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (n=2, another -CH₂- group), causing the second **t**riplet.\n\n3.  **Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure:**\n    *   A careful, methodical check of each option against the NMR requirements is necessary. The analysis should focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n        *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n        *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n        *   Like option A, it lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   This structure has two different methine protons (at C3 and C4, numbering from the COOH group) that must be analyzed.\n        *   **Proton at C3:** It is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H → **doublet**), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H → **triplet**), and the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H → **triplet**). This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n        *   **Proton at C4:** It is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H → **doublet**), the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H → **triplet**), and the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H → **quartet**). This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that possesses the necessary structural features to produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the correct answer involves a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a careful evaluation of each candidate structure.\n\n1.  **Initial Data Assessment**: I first analyze the information given. The core of the problem lies in interpreting two key pieces of spectroscopic data: FTIR and ¹H NMR. The goal is to match this data to one of four possible molecular structures.\n\n2.  **FTIR Analysis**:\n    *   A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of an O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) bond, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. I check the four options (A, B, C, D) and confirm they are all carboxylic acids. This means the FTIR data confirms the functional group but doesn't help distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data will be the deciding factor.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Analysis (The Decisive Step)**:\n    *   The problem states there are two particularly complex signals: a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt).\n    *   I must deconstruct what these patterns mean based on the n+1 rule for spin-spin splitting.\n        *   **dtq**: A proton is being split by three different sets of neighbors: one proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n        *   **dtt**: A proton is being split by three different sets of neighbors: one proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and a *second, different* set of two equivalent protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n    *   **Key Insight**: The correct molecule must contain *both* of these environments. I need to find a structure with two different protons, one that produces the `dtq` signal and another that produces the `dtt` signal.\n\n4.  **Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate**: I will now examine each of the four structures provided in the question, looking for the methine (CH) protons, as they are the most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors. I will be careful to match the analysis to the correct letter (A, B, C, or D) as given in the prompt.\n\n    *   **Candidate A: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would give a `dtq` signal.\n        *   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to one H and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Candidate B: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H) and two different CH₂ groups (the one at C4 and the one in its ethyl substituent). This would give a `dtt` signal.\n        *   However, there is no proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H neighbor. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Candidate C: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would give a `dtq` signal.\n        *   Like A, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Candidate D: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   This structure has two different methine protons to analyze (at C3 and C4, numbering from the COOH).\n        *   **Proton at C3**: It's coupled to the H at C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ at C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives another triplet). This combination produces a **dtt** signal. This is a match for one of the signals.\n        *   **Proton at C4**: It's coupled to the H at C3 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives a triplet), and the terminal CH₃ group (3H, gives a quartet). This combination produces a **dtq** signal. This is a match for the other signal.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Structure D is the only one that can produce both of the required complex NMR signals.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation**: Based on the step-by-step analysis, D is the only logical answer.

The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **FTIR is for functional groups:** The FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid but cannot distinguish between the isomers.\n2.  **Both signals are required:** The correct structure is the *only one* that can produce *both* the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals. It is not enough for a structure to produce only one of them.\n3.  **Analyze neighbors correctly:** The splitting pattern is determined by the number of equivalent protons on all adjacent carbons. For a `dtq`, the proton must have three distinct neighboring groups of protons (1H, 2H, and 3H). For a `dtt`, it must have three distinct neighboring groups of protons (1H, 2H, and another, different 2H).\n4.  **Mapping structure to option:** It is critical to correctly associate the structural analysis with the corresponding lettered option from the question. The structure `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` is explicitly listed as option D.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, structure D is the only candidate that has protons in two distinct environments that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum.

These patterns arise when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons. The correct structure must contain protons that can generate *both* of these signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   Another, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now systematically analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each of the four structures to see which one contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (1H), the -CH₂- on C4 (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one C-H and two different -CH₂- groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (1H) and two different -CH₂- groups (one from the main chain at C4, one from the ethyl substituent on C3). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton adjacent to a C-H, a -CH₂-, and a -CH₃ group. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the H on C4 (1H), the -CH₂- at C2 (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, like option A, it lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure, numbering from the COOH group as C1:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The -CH₂- group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The terminal -CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The -CH₂- group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The -CH₂- group of its own ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  **FTIR Confirmation:** The FTIR data reliably confirms the carboxylic acid functional group but is insufficient for isomer identification.\n2.  **Dual NMR Signals:** The crucial piece of evidence is that the compound must exhibit *both* the `dtq` and `dtt` signals. It is not enough for a candidate to produce only one of them.\n3.  **Structural Analysis:** A careful, proton-by-proton analysis of the neighbors is required. The methine (CH) protons are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting.\n4.  **Correct Identification:** Only structure D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has the specific arrangement of protons required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (from the proton at C4) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (from the proton at C3) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis of spectroscopic data to identify an unknown compound from a list of four isomers.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Analysis**:\n    *   The problem states there is a \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers\" and a \"strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers\".\n    *   The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.

This would produce a `dtq` signal. However, this molecule lacks the environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        Let's label the key protons on the main chain: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is coupled to:\n            1.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **FTIR for Functional Groups:** The FTIR data is used to identify the functional groups present. The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) are classic signatures of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the four isomers, as they are all carboxylic acids.\n2.  **NMR for Structure Elucidation:** The specific connectivity (the isomer) must be determined from the ¹H NMR splitting patterns. The information about the absence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms there are no C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all options.\n3.  **Both Signals are Required:** The most crucial point is that the correct molecular structure must contain protons that can generate *both* the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signals. It is not sufficient for a candidate structure to produce only one of these.\n4.  **Deconstructing Complex Splitting:**\n    *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** requires a proton to be coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (2H, causing the triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (3H, causing the quartet).\n    *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** requires a different proton to be coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (2H, causing the first triplet), and a second, chemically different set of two equivalent protons (2H, causing the second triplet).\n5.  **Systematic Evaluation:** Each candidate structure must be analyzed methodically to see if it meets both NMR criteria. The analysis should focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are the most likely source of such complex splitting.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze FTIR Data**\nAs established in the careful points, the FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid.

This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, like option A, it lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.

The core of the problem lies in interpreting two key pieces of spectroscopic data: FTIR and ¹H NMR. The goal is to match this data to one of four possible molecular structures.\n\n2.  **FTIR Analysis**:\n    *   A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of an O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) bond, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. I check the four options (A, B, C, D) and confirm they are all carboxylic acids. This means the FTIR data confirms the functional group but doesn't help distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data will be the deciding factor.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Analysis (The Decisive Step)**:\n    *   The problem states there are two particularly complex signals: a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt).\n    *   I must deconstruct what these patterns mean based on the n+1 rule for spin-spin splitting.\n        *   **dtq**: A proton is being split by three different sets of neighbors: one proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n        *   **dtt**: A proton is being split by three different sets of neighbors: one proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and a *second, different* set of two equivalent protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n    *   **Key Insight**: The correct molecule must contain *both* of these environments. I need to find a structure with two different protons, one that produces the `dtq` signal and another that produces the `dtt` signal.\n\n4.  **Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate**: I will now examine each of the four structures provided in the question, looking for the methine (CH) protons, as they are the most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors. I will be careful to match the analysis to the correct letter (A, B, C, or D) as given in the prompt.\n\n    *   **Candidate A: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would give a `dtq` signal.\n        *   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to one H and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Candidate B: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H) and two different CH₂ groups (the one at C4 and the one in its ethyl substituent). This would give a `dtt` signal.\n        *   However, there is no proton coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H neighbor. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal.

Careful Point: Interpreting the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid. Its broadness is a key feature, resulting from extensive hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data unambiguously identifies the compound as a carboxylic acid. Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore decisive.\n\n**2. Careful Point: Deconstructing the ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to the solution lies in finding a single molecule that contains protons in two very specific electronic environments.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton to produce this signal, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, a -CH₂- group), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (n=3, a -CH₃ group), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a different proton to produce this signal, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, a -CH₂- group), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   A second, chemically non-equivalent set of two adjacent protons (n=2, another -CH₂- group), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n**3. Careful Point: Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each option as presented in the question, without re-labeling, to see which structure can produce *both* the `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group simultaneously. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, like option A, it lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure, numbering the main chain from the COOH group as carbon #1: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure **D** is the only candidate that has the specific arrangement of protons required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum. The proton at C4 gives the `dtq` signal, and the proton at C3 gives the `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data and the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Interpretation**:\n    *   All candidate answers correctly interpret the FTIR data.\n    *   A very broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is the signature of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. This is consistent with all four options (A, B, C, and D) and does not distinguish between them. The ¹H NMR data is therefore decisive.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Data Interpretation**:\n    *   The core of the problem lies in identifying a single molecule that contains protons matching two very specific and complex splitting patterns.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This requires a proton to be coupled to three distinct neighboring groups:\n        *   One adjacent proton (n=1) to cause the **d**oublet.\n        *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2) to cause the **t**riplet.\n        *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (n=3) to cause the **q**uartet.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.

We will analyze the methine (CH) protons.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H).

This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure, numbering from the COOH group as C1: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   **Proton at C3**: This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n            2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n            3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n            This combination produces a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n        *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n            2.

In the original question, this structure corresponds to option D. The discrepancies in the candidate answers (A, B, C, or D) arise from some agents mislabeling or reordering the options in their analysis. However, the underlying chemical reasoning in nearly all cases correctly identifies the same molecular structure. Based on a rigorous and direct mapping to the original question, structure D is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound, incorporating careful points from the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\nThe FTIR data provides information about the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.

All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all choices but does not help distinguish between them. The identification must be made using the more detailed ¹H NMR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the two complex splitting patterns described. These patterns arise when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons. The correct structure must contain protons that can generate *both* of these signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   Another, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now systematically analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each of the four structures to see which one contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (1H), the -CH₂- on C4 (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H).

This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (1H) and two different -CH₂- groups (one from the main chain at C4, one from the ethyl substituent on C3). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, this molecule does not have a proton adjacent to a C-H, a -CH₂-, and a -CH₃ group. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the H on C4 (1H), the -CH₂- at C2 (2H), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, like option A, it lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure, numbering from the COOH group as C1:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The -CH₂- group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The terminal -CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The -CH₂- group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The -CH₂- group of its own ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  **FTIR Confirmation:** The FTIR data reliably confirms the carboxylic acid functional group but is insufficient for isomer identification.\n2.  **Dual NMR Signals:** The crucial piece of evidence is that the compound must exhibit *both* the `dtq` and `dtt` signals. It is not enough for a candidate to produce only one of them.\n3.  **Structural Analysis:** A careful, proton-by-proton analysis of the neighbors is required. The methine (CH) protons are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting.\n4.  **Correct Identification:** Only structure D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has the specific arrangement of protons required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (from the proton at C4) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (from the proton at C3) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis of spectroscopic data to identify an unknown compound from a list of four isomers.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Analysis**:\n    *   The problem states there is a \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers\" and a \"strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers\".\n    *   The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The first step is to interpret the functional groups present.\n*   The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but is insufficient to identify the specific isomer. The ¹H NMR data is therefore decisive.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The core of the problem is to correctly deconstruct the complex splitting patterns and match them to a single molecular structure. The correct molecule must contain protons that give rise to *both* described signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This pattern arises from a proton that is spin-coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, e.g., a -CH₂- group), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (n=3, e.g., a -CH₃ group), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern arises from a different proton that is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, a -CH₂- group), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   A second, chemically non-equivalent set of two adjacent protons (n=2, another -CH₂- group), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to evaluate each structure systematically against the requirements for *both* signals and to use the lettering (A, B, C, D) provided in the original question to avoid confusion.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   *Result: Incorrect.*\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a single proton, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n    *   *Result: Incorrect.*\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   *Result: Incorrect.*\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure, numbering from the COOH group as carbon 1:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n    *   *Result: Correct. This is the only structure that produces both required signals.*\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis confirms that only structure D has the specific arrangement of protons required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **FTIR as a Functional Group Identifier:** The FTIR data (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for a carboxylic acid. This confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the four isomers, as they are all carboxylic acids. The decisive information must come from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n2.  **Deconstructing Complex Splitting:** The core of the problem is correctly interpreting the two complex ¹H NMR signals. This requires understanding that a proton's signal is split by each set of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means one proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (2H, causing the triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (3H, causing the quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a single proton (1H, causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (2H, causing the first triplet), and a second, chemically different set of two equivalent protons (2H, causing the second triplet).\n3.  **Systematic Evaluation:** The only way to be certain is to examine each of the four candidate structures to see which one contains protons that would generate *both* of these specific signals. The analysis must be applied to the methine (CH) protons, as they are the most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n4.  **Matching Structure to Letter:** It is crucial to correctly match the chemical structure to the letter (A, B, C, or D) provided in the original question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\nAs established, the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) definitively identify the compound as a carboxylic acid. All four options are consistent with this data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Requirements**\nThe correct molecule must have two specific methine (CH) protons:\n*   One proton (let's call it Hₐ) must be adjacent to another single proton, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group to produce the **dtq** signal.\n*   Another proton (Hₑ) must be adjacent to another single proton and two different CH₂ groups to produce the **dtt** signal.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a single proton, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, like option A, it lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure, numbering from the COOH group as C1:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that has protons in two distinct environments that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The proton at C3 gives the `dtt` signal, and the proton at C4 gives the `dtq` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   The broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also found in carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.
