To find the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, we must consider the dissociation of this complex to reach equilibrium. The relevant reaction is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Correct Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the **formation constant** ($K_f$), which corresponds to the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The expression for $K_f$ is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is the standard method to track concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of $[CaY]^{2-}$ that dissociates. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, this will produce 'x' M of $Ca^{2+}$ and 'x' M of $Y^{4-}$.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the table into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large. This indicates that the equilibrium lies overwhelmingly in favor of the complex, meaning a negligible amount will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the valid approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, rearrange to solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n7.  **Match to the Correct Option:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Equilibrium:** The key is to analyze the dissociation of the complex, as the initial solution contains the complex, not the free ions. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial instruction. It allows the direct use of the absolute formation constant ($K_f$) without needing to correct for the various protonated forms of EDTA that would exist at a non-ideal (lower) pH. Using a pH-dependent *conditional* formation constant ($K'_{f}$) would be required otherwise.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The approximation $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$ is valid because the calculated $x$ ($6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$) is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02. This confirms the assumption was correct.\n*   **Consistency of Calculation:** All provided candidate answers, despite some confusion with the final letter choice due to different option ordering, performed the chemical calculation correctly and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This provides high confidence in the numerical answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the fundamental chemical principles of the problem, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem begins with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which can be denoted as `[CaY]²⁻`. To find the concentration of free calcium ions, `[Ca²⁺]`, we must consider the dissociation of this complex to reach equilibrium. The reaction is:\n    `[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`\n    (where `Y⁴⁻` represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand).\n\n2.  **Define the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the **formation constant (K_f)**, which corresponds to the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n    `Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻`\n    The expression for this constant is:\n    `K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰`\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is used to track the concentrations of the species involved. Let 'x' be the concentration of `[CaY]²⁻` that dissociates. This 'x' will also be the equilibrium concentration of `Ca²⁺` and `Y⁴⁻`.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `[CaY]²⁻` | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| `Ca²⁺` | 0 | +x | x |\n| `Y⁴⁻` | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant expression:\n    `K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)`\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²`\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The formation constant (`K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰`) is extremely large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and therefore, very little of it will dissociate. The value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows for the valid approximation:\n    `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²`\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for `x`, which represents `[Ca²⁺]`:\n    `x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²` or `4 x 10⁻¹³`\n    `x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)`\n    `x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated equilibrium concentration of calcium ions is approximately **6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M**. Matching this result with the options provided in the question:\n    *   **A) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M**\n    *   B) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    *   C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    *   D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value corresponds directly to option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Equilibrium:** The analysis must focus on the *dissociation* of the existing complex, as that is the source of the free `Ca²⁺` ions at equilibrium.\n*   **Correct Use of K_f:** The formation constant must be applied to the correctly formulated equilibrium expression, `K_f = [complex] / ([ion1][ion2])`. All the candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly used this logic.\n*   **The \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial piece of information that simplifies the problem significantly. It allows the direct use of the given `K_f` value without needing to account for the protonation of free EDTA, which would create a more complex, pH-dependent system.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` is justified by the very large `K_f` value. The final result (`x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷`) confirms the validity of this assumption, as `x` is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers that performed the calculation arrived at the same numerical result (`~6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`). The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to variations in the multiple-choice options they were presented with. The chemical reasoning and mathematical steps are sound and consistent across all of them, leading to one unambiguous numerical answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this chemical equilibrium problem by following a systematic approach, which is consistently demonstrated across the provided candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Reaction:** The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. To find the concentration of free calcium ions, we must analyze the dissociation of this complex:\n    `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`\n\n2.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** We are given the formation constant (`K_f`), which is for the reverse reaction. The expression for `K_f` is:\n    `K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])`\n\n3.  **Define Equilibrium Concentrations:** I will use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table logic. Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of `Ca²⁺`. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of `EDTA⁴⁻` will also be 'x'. The concentration of the complex will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus the amount that dissociated ('x').\n\n4.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The formation constant (`K_f = 5x10¹⁰`) is extremely large. This means the complex is very stable and only a tiny amount, 'x', will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' is negligible compared to the initial concentration, allowing the approximation `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ≈ 0.02 M`.\n\n5.  **Solve for 'x':** With the approximation, the equilibrium expression simplifies to `K_f ≈ 0.02 / x²`. I will write a Python script to rearrange this equation and solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I will compare the calculated value of 'x' to the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct Equilibrium:** The calculation must be based on the dissociation of the complex, as the initial solution contains the complex, not the free ions.\n*   **Correct Use of K_f:** The formation constant is used, but it's applied to the equilibrium state resulting from dissociation. The expression `K_f = (initial_complex - x) / x²` is the correct setup.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` is justified because `K_f` is very large, indicating `x` will be very small. The final result will confirm this.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial piece of information. It allows us to use the given `K_f` value directly without needing to account for the protonation of the free EDTA ligand, which would create a more complex, pH-dependent calculation.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option:** As seen in the candidate answers, a common error is correctly calculating the numerical value but then assigning it to the wrong letter option.

The relevant reaction is:\n    `[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`\n\n2.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** We are given the formation constant (`K_f`), which corresponds to the reverse reaction (`Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻`). The expression for `K_f` is:\n    `K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰`\n\n3.  **Define Equilibrium Concentrations (ICE Table):** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of `Ca²⁺`. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of `Y⁴⁻` will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will be its initial value minus 'x'.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `[CaY]²⁻` | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| `Ca²⁺` | 0 | +x | x |\n| `Y⁴⁻` | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** We place the equilibrium concentrations into the `K_f` expression:\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)`\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²`\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The formation constant (`K_f`) is extremely large, indicating that the complex is very stable and the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be negligibly small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows for the valid approximation:\n    `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\n6.  **Solve for 'x':** The equation simplifies significantly:\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²`\n\n    Rearranging to solve for `x²`:\n    `x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²` or `4 x 10⁻¹³`\n\n    Now, solve for 'x' by taking the square root:\n    `x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n\n7.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, `[Ca²⁺]`, is `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value perfectly matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Equilibrium:** The analysis must focus on the **dissociation** of the Ca-EDTA complex, as that is the process that produces the free Ca²⁺ ions in the solution.\n*   **Correct Use of K_f:** The formation constant applies to the reverse reaction. It is crucial to set up the equilibrium expression correctly as `K_f = [product]/[reactants]` relative to the formation reaction, which leads to `K_f = (0.02 - x) / x²`.\n*   **The \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a critical piece of information that simplifies the problem. It allows the direct use of the given `K_f` value, as it implies the pH is high enough to prevent the protonation of the free EDTA anion (`Y⁴⁻`), which would otherwise lower the effective binding strength and require a pH-dependent conditional constant (`K'_f`).\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The assumption that `x` is negligible compared to 0.02 M is justified by the very large `K_f` value. The final calculation confirms this, as `6.32 x 10⁻⁷` is indeed much smaller than `0.02`.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly performed the chemical calculation, arriving at the numerical result of `~6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`.

To find the concentration of free calcium ions, we must analyze the dissociation of this complex:\n    `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`\n\n2.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** We are given the formation constant (`K_f`), which is for the reverse reaction. The expression for `K_f` is:\n    `K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])`\n\n3.  **Define Equilibrium Concentrations:** I will use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table logic. Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of `Ca²⁺`. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of `EDTA⁴⁻` will also be 'x'. The concentration of the complex will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus the amount that dissociated ('x').\n\n4.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The formation constant (`K_f = 5x10¹⁰`) is extremely large. This means the complex is very stable and only a tiny amount, 'x', will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' is negligible compared to the initial concentration, allowing the approximation `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ≈ 0.02 M`.\n\n5.  **Solve for 'x':** With the approximation, the equilibrium expression simplifies to `K_f ≈ 0.02 / x²`.

The expression `K_f = (initial_complex - x) / x²` is the correct setup.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` is justified because `K_f` is very large, indicating `x` will be very small.

To find the concentration of free calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of this complex. The relevant equilibrium reaction is:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Identify the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$), which corresponds to the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. At equilibrium, this will be the concentration of both $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large. This indicates that the complex is very stable and the equilibrium lies overwhelmingly in favor of the complex. Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the valid approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Now, take the square root to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Match the Result to the Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

The equilibrium expression must be set up correctly as $K_f = \\frac{[\\text{complex}]}{[\\text{ion1}][\\text{ion2}]}$.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial instruction that simplifies the problem. It allows the use of the absolute formation constant ($K_f$) without needing to correct for the various protonated forms of EDTA that would exist at a non-ideal (e.g., acidic) pH. This avoids the need for a conditional formation constant ($K_f'$).\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The approximation that the change in the complex's concentration is negligible ($0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$) is justified because K_f is very large.

The result (`x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷`) confirms that `x` is many orders of magnitude smaller than `0.02`, validating the approximation.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial piece of information. It allows us to use the given `K_f` value directly, as it implies the pH is high enough (typically >10) for the free EDTA to be fully deprotonated as `EDTA⁴⁻`. Without this assumption, a more complex calculation involving a pH-dependent conditional formation constant would be necessary.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical result of `~6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`.

The final decision must be based on matching the correct numerical result to the options listed in the original question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided answers and identifying key points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem starts with a solution that is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as `[CaY]²⁻`. To find the concentration of free calcium ions, `[Ca²⁺]`, we must consider the dissociation of this complex. The relevant equilibrium reaction is:\n    `[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`\n    (where `Y⁴⁻` represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand)\n\n2.  **Relate the Given Constant to the Reaction:** The problem provides the **formation constant** (`K_f` or `KCa-EDTA`), which corresponds to the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n    `Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻`\n    The expression for this constant is:\n    `K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰`\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is the standard method to track concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of `[CaY]²⁻` that dissociates. This 'x' will also be the equilibrium concentration of `Ca²⁺` and `Y⁴⁻`.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `[CaY]²⁻` | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| `Ca²⁺` | 0 | +x | x |\n| `Y⁴⁻` | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:** We substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant expression:\n    `K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)`\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²`\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The formation constant (`K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰`) is extremely large. This indicates that the complex is very stable and the equilibrium lies overwhelmingly in favor of the complex. Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be negligibly small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the valid simplifying approximation:\n    `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** The equation simplifies to:\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²`\n\n    Now, we rearrange to solve for `x`, which represents the equilibrium concentration of `[Ca²⁺]`:\n    `x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²` or `4 x 10⁻¹³`\n    `x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)`\n    `x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`. Comparing this result with the original options provided in the question:\n    A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value is a direct match for option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Equilibrium:** The key is to analyze the **dissociation** of the complex, as the initial solution contains the complex, not the free ions.\n*   **Correct Use of K_f:** One must use the formation constant expression correctly for the dissociation problem, i.e., `K_f = (Initial_Complex - x) / x²`. Alternatively, one could calculate the dissociation constant `K_d = 1/K_f` and use the expression `K_d = x² / (Initial_Complex - x)`. Both methods yield the same result.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial piece of information. It simplifies the problem by allowing the direct use of the absolute formation constant (`K_f`). At non-ideal (lower) pH values, the free EDTA would be protonated, and one would need to use a pH-dependent *conditional* formation constant (`K'_f`), which would be smaller than `K_f`.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` is valid because the calculated `x` (`6.3 x 10⁻⁷`) is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02, confirming the assumption was correct.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All the provided candidate answers performed the chemical calculation correctly, arriving at the numerical result of `~6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistencies in the option lists they were working with, not errors in the chemical reasoning.
