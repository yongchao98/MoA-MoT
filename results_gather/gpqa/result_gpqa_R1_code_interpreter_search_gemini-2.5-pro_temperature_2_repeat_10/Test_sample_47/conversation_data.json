    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the acid-catalyzed α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone. This molecule has a chiral center at C2, so a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-2-bromocyclohexanone is formed.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** An α-haloketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α' position, which is C6 in this case) undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a strong base.\n    1.  The base (OH-) removes a proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, attacking the carbon with the bromine (C2) to form a strained bicyclic intermediate called a cyclopropanone (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The ring opens to relieve the strain, breaking the C1-C6 bond to form the more stable carbanion (a primary carbanion at C6).\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (during aqueous workup) yields cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. This product is achiral.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This reagent is specifically used to selectively reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is much less reactive than LiAlH4 and allows the reaction to be stopped at the aldehyde stage without significant further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (C₅H₉CHO). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 1 (on the aldehyde group) + 9 (on the cyclopentane ring) = 10.\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we look at the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, due to rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation), the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry (a Cs plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon it's attached to, the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\n1.  **H on the aldehyde group (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is **Type 1**.\n2.  **H on the C1 carbon:** This hydrogen is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is **Type 2**.\n3.  **H atoms on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because of their different spatial relationships to the substituent on C1. This gives rise to two distinct types of hydrogen for this group.\n    *   One set of two equivalent hydrogens {H on C2, H on C5}. This is **Type 3**.\n    *   The other set of two equivalent hydrogens {H' on C2, H' on C5}. This is **Type 4**.\n4.  **H atoms on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to C2/C5, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4.\n    *   One set of two equivalent hydrogens {H on C3, H on C4}. This is **Type 5**.\n    *   The other set of two equivalent hydrogens {H' on C3, H' on C4}. This is **Type 6**.\n\nIn summary, we have the following distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde-H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5-H_a (2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5-H_b (2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4-H_a (2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4-H_b (2 protons)\n\nAdding up the types gives a total of 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms."
