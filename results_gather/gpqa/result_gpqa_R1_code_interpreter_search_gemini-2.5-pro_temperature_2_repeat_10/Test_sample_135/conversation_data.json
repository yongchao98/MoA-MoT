    "This problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ . f) dV`.\nThe vector field `f` is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial from the origin. In vector form, using spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThis problem is ideally suited for the application of the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume.\n\nThe theorem is expressed as:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side, which is the surface integral of `f` over the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n1.  **The vector field on the surface:** The surface `S` is the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n2.  **The differential surface element:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element vector `dS` points radially outward, which is the same direction as `r_hat`. So, `dS = dS * r_hat`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n\n3.  **The dot product `f . dS`:** Now we compute the dot product to be integrated:\n    `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] . [dS * r_hat]`\n    Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r_hat . r_hat = 1`), the expression simplifies to:\n    `f . dS = (1/R^2) * dS`\n\n4.  **The surface integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface `S` of the sphere:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) * dS`\n    Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is a constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` represents the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere with radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substituting the surface area into the equation:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    The `R^2` terms cancel out, leaving:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = 4π`\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this result is equal to the original volume integral we wanted to find.\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = 4π`\n\n***\n**Note on the singularity:** One might try to calculate the divergence `∇ . f` directly. In spherical coordinates, `∇ . f` for `r > 0` is `0`. However, the field `f(r) = 1/r^2 * r_hat` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume of integration. The divergence at the origin is technically a Dirac delta function. The Divergence Theorem provides the correct method to evaluate the integral by relating it to the flux on the boundary, thereby correctly accounting for the singularity at the origin.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
