    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\n*   The system is a spin-1/2 particle. The spin operator is `S` and its components are `Sx`, `Sy`, `Sz`.\n*   The magnetic moment is given by the vector relation `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, a magnetic field `B` is in the +Z direction.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the spin is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_z = -γB S_z`. \"Aligned\" typically implies the lowest energy state. The energy is lowest when the magnetic moment `μ` is parallel to the magnetic field `B`. For `μ = γS` (with γ > 0), this happens when the spin `S` is also parallel to `B`.\n*   The spin being aligned with the +Z direction means the particle is in the eigenstate of `S_z` with the maximum positive eigenvalue. This state is commonly denoted as `|+z⟩` or spin-up.\n*   So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and the Time Evolution\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The \"sudden\" change means the state of the particle does not change at the instant `t=0`. So, the initial state for the new evolution is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian, `H = -μ ⋅ B_y = -γB S_y`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, and the state at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian, we get `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (which means the quantum mechanical expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   The expectation value is `<μ_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Let's focus on calculating `<S_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n### Method 1: Using Rotation Operators\n*   The operator `exp(iθ S_y/ħ)` represents a rotation of the state by an angle `θ` around the y-axis.\n*   In our case, the angle of rotation is `θ(t) = γBt`.\n*   The state `|ψ(t)⟩` is the initial state `|+z⟩` rotated by an angle `γBt` around the y-axis.\n*   Classical intuition helps here: a spin vector `S` pointing along Z, when subjected to a magnetic field along Y, will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n*   The projection of the spin vector onto the Z-axis will be `S_z(t) = |S| cos(ωt)`.\n*   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n*   The quantum mechanical expectation value follows the classical motion. The initial expectation value is `<S_z>(0) = ⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ = ħ/2`.\n*   Therefore, the expectation value at time `t` will be `<S_z>(t) = <S_z>(0) cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   Then, the expectation value of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   This is a sinusoidal oscillation with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### Method 2: Energy Eigenstate Decomposition\n*   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γBS_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n    *   `S_y |±y⟩ = ±(ħ/2) |±y⟩`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues are `E_± = -γB(±ħ/2)`. So, `E_+ = -γBħ/2` (for `|+y⟩`) and `E_- = +γBħ/2` (for `|-y⟩`).\n*   Any oscillation in the system will have a frequency related to the difference in energy eigenvalues: `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n*   `ΔE = |E_- - E_+| = |(+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2)| = |γBħ| = γBħ` (assuming γ and B are positive).\n*   The oscillation frequency is `ω = ΔE/ħ = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n*   This method works because the initial state `|+z⟩` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. Specifically, `|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2`. Since both energy levels are populated in the initial state, the system will exhibit oscillations at the frequency corresponding to their energy difference.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods show that the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates according to `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
