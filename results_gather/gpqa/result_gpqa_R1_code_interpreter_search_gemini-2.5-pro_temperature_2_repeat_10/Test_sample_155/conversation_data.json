    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the combined product mixture using two different types of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2      H\n                \\    /\n                 C==C\n                /    \\\n               H      CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is an epoxidation.\n    *   This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   The syn-addition to a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, and mCPBA is treated as an achiral reagent, the epoxidation can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   This leads to the formation of a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This results in acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, where a water molecule opens the epoxide ring.\n    *   The mechanism is an **anti-addition** (SN2-type backside attack) of water on the protonated epoxide. The water molecule attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   So, the overall reaction sequence (epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis) results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the original alkene.\n    *   A mnemonic for the stereochemistry is that an **E**-alkene undergoing **anti**-addition gives a **meso** product (\"**E**-**A**nti-**M**eso\").\n    *   Let's confirm this by looking at one enantiomer of the epoxide, for example, the (4R,5R) epoxide. The anti-attack of water at either C4 or C5 will lead to inversion of configuration at that center.\n        *   Attack at C4: configuration changes from R to S. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5: configuration changes from R to S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) products are the same achiral, meso compound due to a plane of symmetry. The same meso compound would be formed from the (4S,5S) epoxide.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n                \\    /\n                 C==C\n                /    \\\n               H      H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   Again, this is a **syn-addition**.\n    *   Syn-addition to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide.\n    *   The resulting cis-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane) has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.\n    *   Unlike in Reaction 1, only one product is formed in this step.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   This is the same **anti-addition** mechanism as in Reaction 1. The overall process is **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n    *   A mnemonic for this case is that a **Z**-alkene undergoing **anti**-addition gives a **racemic** mixture (\"**Z**-**A**nti-**R**acemic\").\n    *   Let's confirm this. Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S) form), the anti-attack of water occurs.\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-center): configuration inverts to S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-center): configuration inverts to R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two pathways are equally likely. The products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images; they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow we analyze this mixture with two types of HPLC:\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that interacts differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   This differential interaction allows for the **separation of enantiomers**.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound from the chiral enantiomers, as they are diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved. The chromatogram will show three peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
