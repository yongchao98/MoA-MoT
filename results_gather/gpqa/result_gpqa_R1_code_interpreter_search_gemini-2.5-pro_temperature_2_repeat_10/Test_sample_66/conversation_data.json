    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as `|initial> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of `L_{1z}` and `L_{2z}`. A measurement of `L_{1z}` yielding an eigenvalue of `-침` corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m_1 = -1`. Similarly, for `L_{2z}`, an eigenvalue of `-침` corresponds to `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the uncoupled basis state `|final> = |l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2> = |1, 1, -1, -1>`.\n\n2.  **Relate the States using Quantum Mechanics Principles:**\n    *   The probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state.\n    *   Probability `P = |<final|initial>|^2`.\n    *   In our case, `P = |<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`.\n\n3.  **Use the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   The total z-component of angular momentum `m` is the sum of the individual z-components `m_1` and `m_2`. That is, `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n    *   The initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}` with the quantum number `m = -1`.\n    *   Any measurement on the system must conserve this property. This means that if we measure `m_1` and `m_2`, their sum must be equal to the total `m` of the initial state.\n    *   So, any possible measurement outcome `(m_1, m_2)` must satisfy the condition `m_1 + m_2 = -1`.\n\n4.  **Check the Condition for the Desired Outcome:**\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   Let's check the sum for this outcome: `m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   This result (`-2`) does not match the system's total z-component quantum number `m = -1`.\n    *   This means that it is physically impossible to measure `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1` when the system is in the state `|l=2, m=-1>`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   The transition from a state with `m=-1` to a state with `m_{total}=-2` is forbidden. The projection of the initial state onto this final state must be zero.\n    *   `<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, the probability `P = |0|^2 = 0`.\n\n6.  **Verification with Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    The inner product `<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>` is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, often written as `<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>`. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are zero unless `m_1 + m_2 = m`. As shown above, this condition is not met.\n\nWe can use Python with the `sympy` library to explicitly calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# Define the quantum numbers for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient\n# <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>\nl1 = 1\nm1 = -1\nl2 = 1\nm2 = -1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# As reasoned, m1 + m2 (-2) is not equal to m (-1).\n# The coefficient should be zero.\n# Let's compute it.\ncg_coefficient = CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient.\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(float(probability))\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.0\n</execute_result>\n\nThe code output confirms that the probability is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome on a two-electron system.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l1 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   `l2 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   `l = 2`: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. This is an eigenvalue of the `L_z = L_1z + L_2z` operator.\n\n2.  **Identify the Final State (Measurement Outcome):** We are measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum, `L_1z` and `L_2z`.\n    *   We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of `-침` for `L_1z`. The state corresponding to this measurement is one where the magnetic quantum number of the first electron, `m1`, is `-1`.\n    *   Simultaneously, we want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of `-침` for `L_2z`. The state corresponding to this measurement is one where the magnetic quantum number of the second electron, `m2`, is `-1`.\n    *   The final state in the uncoupled basis is therefore `|l1, l2, m1, m2> = |1, 1, -1, -1>`.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. The total magnetic quantum number `m` must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m = m1 + m2`\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** Let's check if the measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, we know the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   From the desired final state measurement, we have `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    *   The sum of the measured components is `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   We see that the required total z-component from the measurement (`-2`) does not equal the system's known total z-component (`-1`).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is a specific superposition of uncoupled states `|1, m1; 1, m2>`. However, it can only be a superposition of states for which `m1 + m2 = -1`. For example, it is a superposition of `|1, 0; 1, -1>` and `|1, -1; 1, 0>`.\n    *   The state `|1, 1, -1, -1>` has a total z-component `m = -2` and is therefore orthogonal to the entire subspace of states where the total z-component is `m = -1`.\n    *   The probability of the measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product between the initial and final states:\n        `P = |<final | initial>|^2 = |<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`\n    *   Because the total `m` values are different (`-2` vs. `-1`), the inner product is zero.\n        `<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0`\n    *   Therefore, the probability is `P = 0^2 = 0`.\n\nThe event is physically impossible because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The code execution in the reasoning step also confirmed this, yielding a probability of `0.0`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
