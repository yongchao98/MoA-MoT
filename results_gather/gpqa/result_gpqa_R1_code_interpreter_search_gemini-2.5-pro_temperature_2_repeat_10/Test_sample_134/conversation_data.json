    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson `X` with a mass `m_X = 6` GeV.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian describing the coupling of the boson `X` to fermions `f` is given by:\n`\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) \\psi_f`\n\nThis Lagrangian contains the interaction term `- \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f`, which mediates the decay of the boson `X` into a fermion-antifermion pair `f\\bar{f}`.\n\nFor a decay process `X \\rightarrow f \\bar{f}` to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the decaying particle (`m_X`) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products (`m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}`).\nSince a fermion and its corresponding antifermion have the same mass (`m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}`), the condition is:\n`m_X \\ge 2 m_f`\n\nGiven that `m_X = 6` GeV, the condition for a fermion `f` to be a possible decay product is:\n`6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2 m_f`\n`m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}`\n\nWe need to check which fundamental fermions (quarks and charged leptons) have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\nLet's list the masses of the quarks and charged leptons:\n*   **Leptons:**\n    *   Electron (`e`): `m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `0.000511 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}` is allowed.\n    *   Muon (`\\mu`): `m_{\\mu} \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `0.1057 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}` is allowed.\n    *   Tau (`\\tau`): `m_{\\tau} \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `1.777 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}` is allowed.\n\n*   **Quarks:**\n    *   Up (`u`): `m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `0.0022 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}` is allowed.\n    *   Down (`d`): `m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `0.0047 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}` is allowed.\n    *   Strange (`s`): `m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `0.095 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}` is allowed.\n    *   Charm (`c`): `m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `1.27 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}` is allowed.\n    *   Bottom (`b`): `m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}` is **not** allowed.\n    *   Top (`t`): `m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}`.\n        Since `173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}`, the decay `X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}` is **not** allowed.\n\nSo, the kinematically allowed decay channels are: `X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}`, `d\\bar{d}`, `s\\bar{s}`, `c\\bar{c}`, `e^{+}e^{-}`, `\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}`, and `\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}`.\n\nNow we compare this set with the given options:\n*   A) `X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}`: Includes `t\\bar{t}` which is not allowed.\n*   B) `X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}`: Includes `b\\bar{b}` which is not allowed, and misses `c\\bar{c}`.\n*   C) `X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}`: Includes `b\\bar{b}` which is not allowed, and misses `c\\bar{c}` and `\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}`.\n*   D) `X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}`: This list matches exactly our derived set of allowed decays.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly lists all the kinematically allowed decays.\n\n<<<D>>>"
