    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. However, other structural features can also lead to chirality, such as axial chirality, which is observed in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (not optically active) if it possesses an element of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl derivative. A biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond. The substituents are located at positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'. These are the \"ortho\" positions relative to the bond connecting the two rings.\n        *   The substituents are two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃). These groups are quite large and create significant steric hindrance.\n        *   **Atropisomerism:** Due to the steric hindrance from these bulky ortho groups, the free rotation around the C-C single bond between the two phenyl rings is prevented. This forces the rings to adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n        *   **Chirality:** To determine if the molecule is chiral, we check for elements of symmetry in its stable, twisted conformation. The substitution pattern is asymmetric on each ring (a -NO₂ and a -COOCH₃ group). The overall molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized. We must check for molecular symmetry. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule. It is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule is superimposable on its mirror image because the plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active.\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active.\n    *   Compound 3 is not optically active.\n    *   Compound 4 is not optically active.\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
