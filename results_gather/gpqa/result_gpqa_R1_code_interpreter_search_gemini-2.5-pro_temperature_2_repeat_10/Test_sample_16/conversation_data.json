    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculation process to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is an equilibrium process. The complex ion, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, partially breaks down into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$).\n\n2.  **Write the Dissociation Reaction:** The chemical equation for the dissociation is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Understand the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For our dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$). The dissociation constant is the reciprocal of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of the free ions are 0.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression for Dissociation:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n    Substitute the equilibrium values from the ICE table:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This implies that the complex barely dissociates, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    \n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    \n    Now, solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    \n    Take the square root to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n    \n    Since x represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, we have:\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    \n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated concentration of $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M matches option C.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10\n\n# Calculate the dissociation constant (Kd)\nKd = 1 / Kf\n\n# Set up the equation: Kd = x^2 / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n# We can approximate this to Kd = x^2 / initial_complex_conc\n# because x is expected to be very small.\n\n# Solve for x^2\nx_squared = Kd * initial_complex_conc\n\n# Solve for x (concentration of Ca2+)\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The variable x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca2+ ions.\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user's question asks for the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the equilibrium reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    Dissociation: $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant, $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, $K_d$, is the reciprocal of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table** (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------------:|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |     0.02 - x    |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n\n4.  **Write the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$**:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\n5.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression and solve for x**:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n    Since $K_d$ is very small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). Thus, we can simplify the denominator:\n    $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now the equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Solve for x by taking the square root of both sides:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    From the ICE table, $x = [Ca^{2+}]$.\n    Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options**:\n    A) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    B) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    D) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option C. The python code output further confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
