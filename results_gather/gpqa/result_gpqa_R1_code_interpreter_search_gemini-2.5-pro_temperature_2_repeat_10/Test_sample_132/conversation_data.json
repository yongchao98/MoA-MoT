    "Here is a breakdown of the step-by-step reasoning and calculations to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical System**\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates in water to provide K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate) ions. H2PO4- is a weak acid.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates to provide 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate) ions, and 2H2O. HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n*   Together, H2PO4- and HPO4^2- form a buffer solution.\n\n### **2. Identify Relevant Equilibria**\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps and corresponding acid dissociation constants (Ka):\n*   (1) H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n*   (2) H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-  (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n*   (3) HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-  (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n\nThe buffer system is based on the second equilibrium (Ka2) since we have both H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-. The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), which is produced in the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n### **3. Calculate Moles and Concentrations**\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of the active species (H2PO4- and HPO4^2-) and their initial concentrations.\n*   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g\n*   Molar mass (Mw) of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g\n*   Molar mass (Mw) of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L\n\nThe calculations are performed as follows:\n*   Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n*   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### **4. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe pH (and thus [H+]) of the buffer is determined by the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- pair and the Ka2 equilibrium. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, or more directly, the Ka2 expression:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nRearranging for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\nSubstitute the concentrations and Ka2 value:\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] = 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n### **5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\nThe concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can assume that the concentration of HPO4^2- remains approximately at its initial value (0.02809 M) because the dissociation constant Ka3 is extremely small (1.8 x 10^-12), meaning very little HPO4^2- will dissociate.\n\nRearranging the Ka3 expression to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.24 x 10^-7 M\n\nTo avoid rounding errors in intermediate steps, the following Python code executes the entire calculation precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2 = moles_HPO4_2 / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4_2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3 = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2) / conc_H_plus\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>6.24e-07 M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24 x 10^-7 M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 5.48x10^-7 M\nB) 6.24x10^-7 M\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
