    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem to determine the number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing stereocenter at carbon C5, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   The chiral center is C5: `-CH(OCH3)-`\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material has a stereocenter at C5 which is unaffected by the reaction, and a new stereocenter is formed at C3, the products will be diastereomers. The hydride attack on the prochiral ketone is not stereospecific, so it can attack from either face, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n    *   Product 1a: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1b: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric diketone and is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** \"Excess\" NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers [(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)] and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 3 and 4) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They elute together, giving a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like compounds 1 and 2; or the pair {3,4} and compound 5) have different physical properties and **will** be separated.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They have different molecular weights, functional groups, and polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   Products from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They will separate. **→ 2 peaks**\n*   Products from Reaction II:\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will elute together. **→ 1 peak**\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time. **→ 1 peak**\n    *   Total from Reaction II products = 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and different constitutional isomers.\n*   Since the chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers, each of the five unique compounds in the mixture will be resolved.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol **→ 1 peak**\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol **→ 1 peak**\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol **→ 1 peak**\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (separated from its enantiomer, #3) **→ 1 peak**\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, but is a unique molecule and diastereomer to the others) **→ 1 peak**\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
