    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the quantities to be compared:**\n    *   The paramagnetic coupling term energy, which I'll denote as $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$.\n    *   The transition energy of a Hydrogen atom, $\\Delta E$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the paramagnetic coupling term $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$:**\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field is given by $H_{para} = -\\vec{\\mu_L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    *   The orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by $\\vec{\\mu_L} = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n    *   Substituting this into the Hamiltonian gives $H_{para} = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    *   The problem states the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product becomes $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n    *   The energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. For a state with a well-defined z-component of angular momentum, the eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n    *   Therefore, the energy is $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$.\n    *   The term $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton.\n    *   So, the final expression for the paramagnetic coupling energy is $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the value of $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$:**\n    *   **Bohr Magneton ($\\mu_B$)**: $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n    *   **Magnetic Field ($B$)**: Given as $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$.\n    *   **Magnetic Quantum Number ($m$)**: The problem specifies \"small values of m\". We can choose a representative small integer value, for example, $m=1$.\n    *   Calculation in electron-volts (eV):\n        $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the transition energy $\\Delta E$:**\n    *   This is the energy of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$.\n    *   The formula relating a photon's energy to its wavelength is $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Calculate the value of $\\Delta E$:**\n    *   **Wavelength ($\\lambda$)**: Given as $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$. (This corresponds to the H-beta line in the Balmer series of hydrogen, a transition from n=4 to n=2).\n    *   A useful constant product is $hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\n    *   Calculation:\n        $\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n6.  **Compare the orders of magnitude:**\n    *   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n    *   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n    *   Clearly, the value of $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ is much smaller than the value of $\\Delta E$.\n    *   Let's find the ratio: $\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n    *   Since the ratio is extremely small, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\nTo verify the precision of the calculation, I will use Python.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Define constants\n# mu_B in eV/T\nmu_B_eV = const.value('Bohr magneton in eV/T')\n\n# Given values\n# Magnetic field in Tesla\nB = 1.0\n# Small integer for the magnetic quantum number\nm = 1\n# Wavelength in meters\nwavelength_m = 0.4861e-6\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1.

The paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV) is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the optical transition energy ($\\approx 2.55$ eV).

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the final answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The core of the question is to compare two energy values for a Hydrogen atom under specific conditions:\n    *   **Energy 1: The Paramagnetic Coupling Term** $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$. This is the energy resulting from the interaction of the atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field.\n    *   **Energy 2: A Transition Energy** $\\Delta E$. This is the energy of a photon involved in an atomic transition, identified by its wavelength.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$):**\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic interaction (Zeeman effect) is given by $H = -\\vec{\\mu_L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$, where $\\vec{\\mu_L}$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n    *   The orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by the formula $\\vec{\\mu_L} = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$.\n    *   Substituting this into the Hamiltonian gives: $H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    *   The quantity $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is defined as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$. We can rewrite the Hamiltonian as $H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n    *   The problem states the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n    *   The energy of this interaction for a specific atomic state is the expectation value $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$. For an eigenstate of $L_z$, the value of $L_z$ is quantized as $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n    *   Therefore, the energy is:\n        $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) B = \\mu_B m B$.\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values:\n        *   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n        *   $m$ is a \"small value\". Let's use $m=1$ as a representative case.\n        *   The value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n    *   Calculation:\n        $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$):**\n    *   The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the formula $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   We are given the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$. (This is the H-beta line of the Balmer series in Hydrogen, corresponding to the transition from n=4 to n=2).\n    *   To simplify the calculation, we use the combined constant $hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\n    *   Calculation:\n        $\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n4.  **Compare the Orders of Magnitude:**\n    *   $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n    *   $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n    *   Comparing the two values, it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is vastly smaller than the photon energy from the electronic transition.\n    *   To be quantitative, let's find their ratio:\n        $\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n    *   Since this ratio is extremely small, we can strongly state that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ is much, much less than $\\Delta E$.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The relationship between the two energies is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$. This corresponds to option B.\n\nHere is the final answer formatted in LaTeX:\nThe paramagnetic coupling term is given by:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B $$\nWith the Bohr magneton $\\mu_B = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$, $B=1\\,\\text{T}$ and a small quantum number $m=1$, we get:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\nThe transition energy of the photon is given by:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nUsing $hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}$ and $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\nComparing the two energies:\n$$ 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} \\ll 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
