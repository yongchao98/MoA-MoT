    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay process for a hydrogen atom, from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The decay proceeds via an intermediate state through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for E1 Transitions:**\n    For an electric dipole transition between an initial state |n,l,m⟩ and a final state |n',l',m'⟩, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer. For decay, n' < n.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State |n',l',m'⟩**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0⟩, so n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = ±1 means l' = l ± 1 = 0 ± 1. Since l' must be non-negative, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n    *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = 0, ±1 means m' = m + Δm = 0 + Δm. So the intermediate state can have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n    *   For decay, n' < n, so n' can be 2 or 1. However, if n'=1, then l' must be 0 (since l < n). But we found l'=1, so the intermediate state cannot have n'=1. Thus, the intermediate state must have **n' = 2**.\n    *   Combining these findings, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. These correspond to the three sublevels of the 2p orbital.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'⟩ → Final State |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   Initial state (for this step): |2,1,m'⟩ where m' can be 1, 0, or -1. So n=2, l=1.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0⟩, so n'=1, l'=0, m'=0.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n        *   From |2,1,m'⟩: Δl = l' - l = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   For the transition to be to |1,0,0⟩, the change in m must be Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'.\n            *   If m' = 1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n            *   If m' = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n            *   If m' = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n    *   Therefore, a dipole transition from any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states to the |1,0,0⟩ state is allowed.\n    *   All options provided in the question identify one of these valid routes, specifically through one of the |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of the Specified Route**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific route, which is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩**\n        The total decay rate from the |3,0,0⟩ state is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. As determined in step 3, the only possible decay channels are to the three states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n        The rate of spontaneous emission between two states |i⟩ and |f⟩ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, `|<f|r|i>|^2`.\n        The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sublevels m' = -1, 0, +1 are equally probable.\n        Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Rate(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩).\n        Let this rate be `A`. The total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩ is `A_total = A + A + A = 3A`.\n        The branching ratio (probability) for the transition into any single specific `m'` state is:\n        `BR = A / A_total = A / (3A) = 1/3`.\n        So, the probability of the first step being |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is **1/3**.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        The atom is now in the intermediate state, e.g., |2,1,0⟩. We need to find its decay channels. The only lower energy level it can decay to via a dipole transition is the n=1 level. For n=1, l must be 0. So, the only possible final state is |1,0,0⟩.\n        Since this is the only allowed decay channel from any |2,1,m'⟩ state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1 (or 100%).\n        So, the probability of the second step, e.g., |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, is **1**.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n        The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route specified in options C and D:\n        `P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = P_step1 * P_step2`\n        `P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3`.\n        The same logic applies to the routes via m'=-1 and m'=1, they each have a total probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    Let's check the options against our calculated probability.\n    A) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n    D) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, Probability 1/3. (Correct route and probability)\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability for the decay from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions.\nThe decay must proceed in two steps:\n1. |3,0,0⟩ $\\rightarrow$ |n',l',m'⟩\n2. |n',l',m'⟩ $\\rightarrow$ |1,0,0⟩\n\nFor the first step, the selection rules ($\\Delta l=\\pm1, \\Delta m=0, \\pm1$) dictate that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $l'<n'$, the principal quantum number $n'$ can be 2. So the intermediate states are the degenerate |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ states.\nSince the initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$), the transition probabilities to the three degenerate $m'$ states of the $l'=1$ level are equal. Therefore, the branching ratio for the transition to any one of these states is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFor the second step, consider the decay from any of the intermediate states, e.g., |2,1,0⟩. The selection rules allow a transition to the |1,0,0⟩ state ($\\Delta l=-1, \\Delta m=0$). This is the only allowed dipole decay channel to a lower energy state. Thus, the branching ratio for this second step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for the specific route |3,0,0⟩$\\rightarrow$|2,1,0⟩$\\rightarrow$|1,0,0⟩ is the product of the branching ratios of the two steps:\n$P = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
