    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $\n    The maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the semi-amplitude of the RV signal, denoted as K. Therefore, K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift:\n    $ K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max} $\n    We are given the maximum periodic shifts for the two planets:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ mÅ\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ mÅ\n    This means the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation for the RV Semi-Amplitude (K):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    $ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $\n    Where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Dependencies and Simplify:**\n    The problem states that the two stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the two planets have the same mass ($M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$). The problem is solvable only if we assume the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. With these quantities being constant for both systems, the equation for K simplifies to a proportionality with the orbital period, P:\n    $ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} $\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n    $ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3} $\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Now, substitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    $ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3} $\n    Let's compute the numerical value.\n    ```python\n    print((5/7)**3)\n    ```\n    <execute_output>\n    0.36443148688046643\n    </execute_output>\n    The result is approximately 0.364. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.36\n    B) ~ 0.85\n    C) ~ 1.40\n    D) ~ 1.96\n\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
