    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of an exoplanet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I will write the expression for the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)$ term also cancels out.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n4.  **Relate Observational Data to Physical Properties:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) induced by each planet on the star. I need to connect this to the semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n5.  **Connect Doppler Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** The maximum Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (the RV semi-amplitude, K) by the formula:\n    $K = c \\times \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where `c` is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n    So, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\times (\\Delta \\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0)}{c \\times (\\Delta \\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0)} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\n6.  **Connect RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Semi-Major Axis (a):** For a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and viewed nearly edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1, as implied by the transit detection), the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_*}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_*$ is the star mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Let's rearrange the formula for K to solve for 'a'.\n    $K^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\right)^2 \\frac{GM_*}{a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (K_2^2 M_*)}{G M_1^2 / (K_1^2 M_*)} = \\frac{M_2^2}{M_1^2} \\times \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Substitute and Combine Formulas:** Now I can substitute the expression for the ratio of K back into this equation:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n    And substitute this result back into the temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\times \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n    This gives a direct formula relating the desired temperature ratio to the given planet masses and Doppler shifts.\n\n10. **Plug in the Values and Calculate:**\n    *   Planet 1 Mass ($M_1$): 7 $M_{Earth}$\n    *   Planet 2 Mass ($M_2$): 5 $M_{Earth}$\n    *   Planet 1 Doppler Shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_1$): 0.03 Å\n    *   Planet 2 Doppler Shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_2$): 0.04 Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n11. **Final Computation:** I will use Python to get the precise decimal value.\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Mass of Planet 1 (M1) in Earth masses\nm1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 (M2) in Earth masses\nm2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 (d_lambda1) in Angstroms\nd_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 (d_lambda2) in Angstroms\nd_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by:\n# (M2/M1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\ntemperature_ratio = (m2 / m1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nTo find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, we can divide the equation for Planet1 by the equation for Planet2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are identical for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the albedo term $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ also cancels. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides information about the Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) caused by each planet, which is measured by the radial velocity (RV) method. This shift is related to the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) by:\n$K = c \\times \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis (`a`) by the following formula (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, $M_p \\ll M_{star}$, and the orbit is viewed edge-on, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected via the transit method):\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\n**5. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (`a`)**\nWe can rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n$K^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} \\right) = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n**6. Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$)**\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\nThe gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) are the same for both and cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) can be found directly from the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\times (\\Delta \\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0)}{c \\times (\\Delta \\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0)} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\times \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\n**8.
