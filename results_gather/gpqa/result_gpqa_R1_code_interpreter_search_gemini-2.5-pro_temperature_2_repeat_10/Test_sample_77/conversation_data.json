    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\nThe scalar potential V and vector potential **A** at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nHere, $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the **retarded time**. It is the time at which the field must have been emitted from the source at position $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time t, traveling at the speed of light c.\n\n### 2. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are:\n\n*   **Charge density:** $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   **Current density:** $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge at time t'.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nSubstituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nThe presence of the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ inside the delta function's argument complicates the integral. The integral is non-trivial, but a standard result in electrodynamics shows that this integration yields a correction factor related to the charge's velocity.\n\nLet's use the problem's notation:\n*   The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$ is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\nThe retarded time condition becomes $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe result of the integration (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]$\n\n### 4. Simplifying the Expressions\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of the expressions:\n\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this back into the potential equations:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions are the well-known Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived formulas with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. This is incorrect. Also, it uses $\\mu$ instead of $\\mu_o$.\n\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   This is incorrect. It uses the static potential and doesn't account for retardation. The vector potential expression is dimensionally and vectorially inconsistent.\n\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   This is also incorrect. Although the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ holds for the correct potentials, the expression given for V is the simple static potential, which is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
