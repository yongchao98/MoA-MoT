    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins, delivered orally. This mimics a natural mucosal infection.\n    *   **Location:** The process is observed in Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Target Cells:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In response to an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ, the primary proliferating cells are lymphocytes, specifically B cells and T cells.\n    *   **Molecular Finding:** Sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene.\" The heavy chain gene is a component of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies it will eventually produce. The \"variable\" region is the part that binds to the antigen.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the provided options in the context of the findings.**\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. While it generates variability, it is not the process happening in a proliferating B cell population within a Peyer's patch *after* antigen exposure. The experiment describes an ongoing immune response, not the initial generation of the B cell repertoire.\n\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers (which are found in Peyer's patches). It changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function. However, it does *not* alter the *variable* region of the heavy chain gene. The observation is high variability in the variable region, not a change in the constant region.\n\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in B cells and has no role in creating variability in immunoglobulin genes.\n\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that takes place in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. SHM intentionally introduces point mutations at a very high rate specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process allows for the selection of B cells that have mutated to have higher affinity for the antigen (a process called affinity maturation). The presence of a proliferating cell population with high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    The scenario describes an active immune response to an intestinal antigen within a Peyer's patch. The key observation is high variability arising in the variable region of the heavy chain in a population of proliferating cells. This perfectly matches the description of somatic hypermutation, a cornerstone of the germinal center reaction aimed at producing high-affinity antibodies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
