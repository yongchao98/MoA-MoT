    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Products:** Both reactions produce a chiral lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The products are enantiomers of each other:\n    *   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" describes a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (a δ-lactone). The \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group at position 4 of the ring. This C4 atom is the stereocenter.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting materials are enantiomers of a compound named \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name.\n    *   This name is best interpreted as a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n    *   Specifically, it's the mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is: `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. (where `iBu` is isobutyl, `(CH₃)₂CHCH₂-`).\n    *   This molecule possesses two different functional groups: an **ester** (`-COO-iBu`) and a **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`).\n    *   Crucially, the carbon at position 3, which bears the ethyl group, is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COO-iBu.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent with specific selectivity. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but typically **does not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group of the starting material `A` into a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` --(LiBH₄)--> `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    2.  The product of this reduction is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n    3.  In the presence of acid (H⁺ from workup), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the stable 6-membered δ-lactone. The hydroxyl group at one end of the molecule attacks the carboxylic acid at the other end.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The chiral center in the starting material (C3 of the chain) is not directly involved in the reduction or the cyclization. No bonds to this chiral center are made or broken.\n    *   During cyclization, the C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   Since the chiral center is unaffected, its stereochemical configuration is retained throughout the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material `A` must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but **does not** readily reduce esters. This selectivity is complementary to LiBH₄.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material `B` into a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group remains unchanged.\n        `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` --(BH₃)--> `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    2.  The product of this reduction is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺), this molecule undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) to form the same 6-membered δ-lactone as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Similar to Reaction 1, the chiral center (C3 of the chain, which becomes C4 of the lactone) is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The stereochemical configuration is retained.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material `B` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
