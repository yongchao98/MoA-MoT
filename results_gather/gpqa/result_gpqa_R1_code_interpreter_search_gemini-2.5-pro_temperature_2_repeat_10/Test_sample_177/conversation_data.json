    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the mass dimension of κ and determine the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### **1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nThe action, S, is the integral of the Lagrangian density, L, over four-dimensional spacetime:\nS = ∫ d⁴x L\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action S is a dimensionless quantity.\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime coordinate x is `[x] = M⁻¹`.\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the four-volume element d⁴x is `[d⁴x] = [x]⁴ = (M⁻¹)⁴ = M⁻⁴`.\n\nSince the action S is dimensionless (`[S] = M⁰ = 1`), the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density L must compensate for the dimension of d⁴x:\n`[S] = [L] [d⁴x] = 1`\n`[L] M⁻⁴ = 1`\n`[L] = M⁴`\n\nThis means that every term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n### **2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Tensors**\n\nWe need to find the mass dimensions of `ψ`, `ψ̄`, `F^{μν}`, and `σ_{μν}`.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (`ψ` and `ψ̄`)**: The kinetic term for a free fermion is part of the full Lagrangian and has the form `L_fermion = ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`. The mass term is `mψ̄ψ`. Like any term in L, this must have a dimension of `M⁴`.\n    `[mψ̄ψ] = M⁴`\n    The mass `m` has a dimension `[m] = M¹`.\n    `M¹ [ψ̄ψ] = M⁴`, which implies `[ψ̄ψ] = M³`.\n    Since `ψ` and `ψ̄` have the same mass dimension, `[ψ]² = M³`, so `[ψ] = [ψ̄] = M^(3/2)`.\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor (`F^{μν}`)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_gauge = -1/4 F_{μν}F^{μν}`. This term must also have a dimension of `M⁴`.\n    `[F_{μν}F^{μν}] = M⁴`\n    `[F^{μν}]² = M⁴`\n    `[F^{μν}] = M²`\n\n*   **Spin Tensor (`σ_{μν}`)**: The tensor `σ_{μν}` is defined as `σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`, where `γ_μ` are the Dirac gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless objects; they are finite-dimensional matrices that mix the components of the spinor field. Therefore, their commutator `[γ_μ, γ_ν]` is also dimensionless.\n    `[σ_{μν}] = M⁰ = 1`\n\n### **3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant `κ`**\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of `κ` from the given interaction term `L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`. This term must also have a mass dimension of `M⁴`.\n\n`[L_int] = [κ] [ψ̄] [σ_{μν}] [ψ] [F^{μν}] = M⁴`\n\nSubstitute the dimensions we found for each component:\n\n`[κ] ⋅ M^(3/2) ⋅ 1 ⋅ M^(3/2) ⋅ M² = M⁴`\n`[κ] ⋅ M^(3/2 + 3/2) ⋅ M² = M⁴`\n`[κ] ⋅ M³ ⋅ M² = M⁴`\n`[κ] ⋅ M⁵ = M⁴`\n`[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹`\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` is -1.\n\n### **4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory is related to the mass dimension of its coupling constants. A simple power-counting rule is as follows:\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a mass dimension `[g] > 0`, the interaction is super-renormalizable.\n*   If `[g] = 0`, the interaction is renormalizable.\n*   If `[g] < 0`, the interaction is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince `[κ] = -1`, which is negative, the interaction term `κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}` is non-renormalizable. This means that at higher orders in perturbation theory (loop diagrams), new types of divergences appear that cannot be absorbed into a redefinition of the original parameters. An infinite number of counter-terms would be needed, making the theory lose its predictive power at high energies. Such terms are typically found in effective field theories.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of κ is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
