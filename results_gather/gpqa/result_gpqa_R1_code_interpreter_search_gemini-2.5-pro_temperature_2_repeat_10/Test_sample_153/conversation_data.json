    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. This is referred to as the M+2 peak.\n    *   The relative intensity of the M+2 peak (32%) compared to the M+ peak (100%) is approximately a 1:3 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption band from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, this value is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two IR features are strong evidence for the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly diagnostic for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not typically couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, each coupling with its neighbor to produce a doublet.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **Conclusion from data:** The molecule is a chlorobenzoic acid with a para substitution pattern. This means a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group are attached to a benzene ring at positions 1 and 4.\n*   **Checking the Molecular Formula:** A chlorobenzoic acid has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Its molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches the mass spectrum perfectly.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which would have a more complex NMR spectrum. It's an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid (lacks the ~11 ppm NMR signal and characteristic broad IR). Incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a para (1,4) arrangement on a benzene ring. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the spectral data (MS, IR, and the characteristic NMR pattern). **Correct.**\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride derivative. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the 11 ppm NMR signal. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2) ring. The four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to a much more complex NMR splitting pattern than two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n\nThe only structure that fits all the evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
