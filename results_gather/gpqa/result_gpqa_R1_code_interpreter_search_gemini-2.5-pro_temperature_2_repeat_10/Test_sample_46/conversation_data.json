    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\n*   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a C=O carbonyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region is the hallmark of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively. This rules out secondary amides or amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, this value is characteristic of an ester (~1750-1715 cm⁻¹). It is generally too high for an amide (~1690-1650 cm⁻¹) or a ketone conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n### **3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield, which means this CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl ester group: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂** group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two groups on the ring cause the four aromatic protons to split into two chemically distinct pairs. One group is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group), and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, -COOR). The electron-donating group shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing group deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data, we have the following structural fragments:\n1.  An ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n4.  A carbonyl group as part of the ester.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives only one possible structure: a benzene ring with an amino group and an ethyl carboxylate group at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options provided:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester group, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- quartet would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the two N-H stretches in the IR spectrum. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets. Also, an amide C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency than 1720 cm⁻¹. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
