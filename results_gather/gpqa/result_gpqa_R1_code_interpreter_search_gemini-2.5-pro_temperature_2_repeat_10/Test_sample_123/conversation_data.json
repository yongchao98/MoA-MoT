    "The problem asks for the Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) required for two-thirds of the particles to reach a detector, given that at a Lorentz factor of `γ₁ = 20`, only one-third reach it.\n\nHere is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand Particle Decay:** The number of particles, `N`, that remain after a time `t` follows the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a relativistic particle is dilated in the laboratory frame. The lab-frame lifetime `τ_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n    Substituting this into the decay equation gives:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Determine the Travel Time:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to reach the detector wall is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n    This travel time is constant for both scenarios.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Survival Fraction:** The fraction (`F`) of particles that reach the detector wall is `N(t) / N₀`. Using the equations above:\n    `F = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `F₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper))`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `F₂ = 2/3` and we need to find `γ₂`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    We can solve this by taking the natural logarithm of both equations.\n    From Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper)`\n    `-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper)`\n    `20 * ln(3) = (R/c) / τ_proper`\n\n    The term `(R/c) / τ_proper` is a constant value determined by the detector's size and the particle's intrinsic properties.\n\n    From Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper)`\n    `γ₂ * ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / τ_proper`\n    `γ₂ * (-ln(1.5)) = -(R/c) / τ_proper`\n    `γ₂ * ln(1.5) = (R/c) / τ_proper`\n\n    Now, we can equate the two expressions for `(R/c) / τ_proper`:\n    `γ₂ * ln(1.5) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    To get a numerical answer, we can compute the values of the logarithms.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor for the first scenario\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# The relationship derived is gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n# This comes from the ratio of the decay equations for the two scenarios.\n# Let F be the survival fraction F = exp(-t / (gamma * tau)).\n# Then ln(F) = -t / (gamma * tau), so gamma = -t / (tau * ln(F)).\n# Therefore, gamma2 / gamma1 = ln(F1) / ln(F2).\n# gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) = gamma1 * -ln(3) / -ln(3/2) = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(1.5).\n\ngamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is `54.18839211345422`, which is approximately 54.\n\nTherefore, a Lorentz factor of about 54 is needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The fraction of particles `F` that survive to reach the detector wall is given by the relativistic decay formula:\n`F = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `t_lab` is the time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the detector wall in the lab frame.\n*   `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame.\n\nThe time `t_lab` can be calculated as the distance (radius `R`) divided by the particle's velocity `v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (`γ` is large), their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n`t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame `τ_lab` is subject to time dilation and is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n`τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nSubstituting these into the survival fraction equation, we get:\n`F = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\nLet's rearrange this equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(F) = -(R / c) / (γ * τ_proper)`\n`γ * ln(F) = -(R / c) / τ_proper`\n\nThe term `-(R / c) / τ_proper` is a constant because the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` do not change between the two scenarios. Therefore, the product `γ * ln(F)` must be constant.\n\nWe can write this relationship for the two scenarios:\n*   **Scenario 1:** `F₁ = 1/3`, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `F₂ = 2/3`, `γ₂ = ?`\n\n`γ₁ * ln(F₁) = γ₂ * ln(F₂)`\n\nNow we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(F₁) / ln(F₂))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3) / -ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n\nNow we calculate the numerical value.\n`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n`ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. The code execution confirms this calculation with an output of `54.19`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe value closest to our calculation is 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
