    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2, i.e., `M_total_1 / M_total_2`.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = M1 + M2) can be determined using the following formula, which combines Kepler's Third Law with the observations of radial velocities:\n    \n    `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    \n    where:\n    *   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Use Key Information:** The problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This is crucial because it tells us that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For an eclipsing system, the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    \n    *   If `i` ≈ 90°, then `sin(i)` ≈ 1.\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula significantly to: `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio:** We want to calculate the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`. When we create this ratio, the constant term `(2 * π * G)` will appear in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus will cancel out.\n    \n    `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]`\n    \n    This leaves a simple proportionality relationship: `M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³`, where `K_total = K1 + K2`.\n\n5.  **Plug in the Values:** Now, we substitute the given values for each system into this ratio.\n\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   `P1` = 2 years\n        *   `K1a` = 10 km/s\n        *   `K1b` = 5 km/s\n        *   `K_total_1` = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    \n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   `P2` = 1 year\n        *   `K2a` = 15 km/s\n        *   `K2b` = 10 km/s\n        *   `K_total_2` = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Using a script to perform the calculation ensures accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5   # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_total_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_total)^3.\n# We calculate the numerator and denominator of the ratio separately.\nnumerator = P1 * (K_total_1)**3\ndenominator = P2 * (K_total_2)**3\n\n# Calculate the final ratio\nratio = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe total mass of a binary star system (`M = m₁ + m₂`) can be determined from the orbital period (`P`) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (`K₁` and `K₂`) of the two stars. The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, for a double-lined spectroscopic binary is:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [ P * (K₁ + K₂)³ ] / [ 2πG * sin³(i) ]\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity amplitudes.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to the observer's line of sight.\n\n**2. Use the Information about Eclipses**\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is a crucial piece of information. Eclipses can only occur if we are viewing the orbital plane nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n\n*   For `i` ≈ 90°, `sin(i)` ≈ 1.\n*   Therefore, `sin³(i)` ≈ 1.\n\nThis simplifies the mass formula significantly, as the `sin³(i)` term can be considered to be 1 for both systems.\n\n**3. Set Up the Ratio**\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio of the total mass of system 1 to the total mass of system 2:\n\nRatio = M_system1 / M_system2\n\nRatio = [ P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ / (2πG) ] / [ P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ / (2πG) ]\n\nThe `2πG` term is a constant that appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This leaves us with a direct proportionality:\n\nRatio = [ P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ ] / [ P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ ]\n\n**4. Plug in the Given Values**\n\n*   **For system_1:**\n    *   `P₁` = 2 years\n    *   `K₁ₐ` = 10 km/s\n    *   `K₁ₑ` = 5 km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities: `K_total₁` = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n*   **For system_2:**\n    *   `P₂` = 1 year\n    *   `K₂ₐ` = 15 km/s\n    *   `K₂ₑ` = 10 km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities: `K_total₂` = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nRatio = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\nRatio = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.7\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.432 is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
