    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be interconverted, usually by the migration of a proton. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**.\n*   **Condition for keto-enol tautomerism:** A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**. This is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the compounds:**\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups opposite each other.\n        *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are the carbons involved in the ring's double bonds.\n        *   Alpha-hydrogens: These alpha-carbons are bonded to another carbon and the carbonyl carbon, forming a C=C bond. They do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n        *   Conclusion: Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it **cannot** exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n        *   Alpha-carbons: The CH₂ groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are each alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   Alpha-hydrogens: Each of these alpha-carbons has two hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Conclusion: Since cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione possesses alpha-hydrogens, it **can** and does exhibit tautomerism. It readily converts to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and exceptionally stable compound.\n\n*   Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is **chiral** if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Condition for chirality:** The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). This is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of the compounds:**\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Analysis: Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Conclusion: Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Structure: This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each carbon of the double bond.\n        *   Analysis: The molecule is planar around the double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n        *   Conclusion: Because it is achiral, dimethyl fumarate **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n*   Therefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Determination:**\n\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
