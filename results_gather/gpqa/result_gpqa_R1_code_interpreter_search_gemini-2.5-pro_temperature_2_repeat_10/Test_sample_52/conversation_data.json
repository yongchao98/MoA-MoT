    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Skeleton:**\n    *   The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two other groups attached to it. Since it's di-substituted, there are four protons (4H) remaining on the ring.\n    *   The presence of a benzene ring contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU) to the molecule (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An absorption peak indicates an **ester group** (-COO-). An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which adds 1 more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (hydrogens on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**, which means it's coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This is a key piece of information. \"Doublet\" means coupling to one adjacent proton. \"Quartet\" means coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d and dq) is classic for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3).\n            *   Let's denote it as -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet.\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) (doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   So, we have a `-CH=CH-CH3` substituent. This contains a C=C double bond, which adds another degree of unsaturation. It also accounts for two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n    *   **1H NMR - Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows **two signals for -CH3 groups**.\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent.\n        *   Therefore, there must be a second, chemically different -CH3 group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n    *   **1H NMR - Aromatic Protons:** There are **two signals for aromatic-H**. This is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which has 4 aromatic protons), particularly a para (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which typically gives two doublets (two signals).\n\n3.  **Count the Hydrogens based on NMR signals:**\n    *   Aromatic protons: A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 H.\n    *   Vinyl protons: The -CH=CH- fragment has 2 H.\n    *   Methyl protons: There are two -CH3 groups, so 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n    *   Total number of hydrogens = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 H**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options C (C12H14O2) and D (C11H14O2), as they have 14 hydrogens. We are left with A (C12H12O2) and B (C11H12O2).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Count the Carbons:**\n    *   We have the following pieces of the molecule:\n        1.  A di-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n        2.  A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3** (which is C3H5)\n        3.  An ester group (-COO-) that incorporates the second methyl group and has no -CH2- groups. The only simple possibilities are an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`) or a methyl ester group (`-CO-O-CH3`). Both of these fragments are **C2H3O2**.\n\n    *   Now, let's assemble these fragments. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n    *   Let's sum the number of carbons from these identified fragments:\n        *   Carbons in the benzene ring: 6\n        *   Carbons in the propenyl group: 3\n        *   Carbons in the ester-methyl fragment (-OCOCH3 or -COOCH3): 2\n    *   Total number of carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11 C**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Formula:**\n    *   Based on our analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms (from the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation:**\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   Let's count the DoU from our deduced structure: 4 (for the benzene ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the propenyl group) + 1 (for the C=O in the ester group) = **6**.\n    *   The DoU calculation matches our structural deduction, confirming that C11H12O2 is the correct formula.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
