    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator (observable) $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation formula from quantum mechanics:\n    $$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\n    Here, $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $A$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$:\n        $$ P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    *   The state of the system, represented by a column vector (ket):\n        $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    *   (The matrices for $P_x$ and $P_y$ and the fact that $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $P_x$ are extra information, useful for context or verification but not strictly necessary for the calculation of $\\Delta P_z$.)\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, which is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   Substitute these values into the uncertainty formula to find $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step 5.1: Find the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$**\n        The bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since the components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real numbers, the conjugate transpose is simply the transpose.\n        $$ \\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n    *   **Step 5.2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n        $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        First, apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $$ P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        Now, multiply by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$:\n        $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0 $$\n        So, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    *   **Step 5.3: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n        First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n        $$ P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        Now, calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n        First, apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $$ P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        Now, multiply by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$:\n        $$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        $$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\n        So, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/2$.\n\n    *   **Step 5.4: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n        Substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n        $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n6.  **Alternative Method (Using Eigenvalues and Probabilities):**\n    The basis is given as the eigenvectors of $P_z$. From the matrix form of $P_z$, we can see its eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\hbar$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = -\\hbar$.\n    The state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is written in this basis:\n    $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ c_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The probability of measuring each eigenvalue is given by $|c_i|^2$.\n    *   Probability of measuring $\\hbar$: $P(\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$.\n    *   Probability of measuring $0$: $P(0) = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$.\n    *   Probability of measuring $-\\hbar$: $P(-\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$.\n    (Check: $1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$)\n\n    Now calculate expectation values using these probabilities:\n    *   $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum \\lambda_i P(\\lambda_i) = (\\hbar)(1/4) + (0)(1/2) + (-\\hbar)(1/4) = \\hbar/4 - \\hbar/4 = 0$.\n    *   $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum \\lambda_i^2 P(\\lambda_i) = (\\hbar^2)(1/4) + (0^2)(1/2) + ((-\\hbar)^2)(1/4) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$.\n\n    These results match the matrix calculation. The uncertainty is:\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) $\\hbar$\n    B) $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$\n    C) $\\hbar/2$\n    D) $\\sqrt{2}\\hbar$\n\n    The correct option is B.\n\nTo be absolutely certain of the arithmetic, we can use a simple python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define constants and matrices\nhbar = 1  # We can set hbar=1 for simplicity and add it back at the end.\nPz = hbar * np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])\nPz2 = Pz @ Pz  # Matrix multiplication to get Pz^2\n\n# Define the state vector\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# Calculate expectation values\n# <psi|Pz|psi> is equivalent to psi_dagger * Pz * psi\npsi_dagger = psi.T.conj()\n\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\nexp_Pz2 = (psi_dagger @ Pz2 @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate uncertainty\nuncertainty_sq = exp_Pz2 - exp_Pz**2\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(uncertainty_sq)\n\n# The result will be a number. We need to express it in terms of hbar.\n# Since we set hbar=1, uncertainty_sq will be 1/2.\n# So, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) * hbar = hbar / sqrt(2).\n\nprint(f\"Expectation value <Pz> = {exp_Pz:.4f} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"Expectation value <Pz^2> = {exp_Pz2:.4f} * hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty Delta(Pz)^2 = {uncertainty_sq:.4f} * hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty Delta(Pz) = {uncertainty:.4f} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"So the answer is hbar / sqrt(2), which is approximately {1/np.sqrt(2):.4f} * hbar\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
