    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves several key concepts from special relativity and particle physics:\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a particle with rest mass `m_0` and moving at high speed is given by `E = γ * m_0 * c^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) compared to its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime `τ_0`). The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ_0`.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle has *not* decayed after a time `t` is `P(t) = exp(-t / τ_lab)`. Consequently, the probability that it *has* decayed is `1 - P(t)`.\n*   **Decay Length:** To observe a decay, the particle must travel a certain distance `L` in the lab before it decays. This distance is `L = v * t`, where `v` is the particle's velocity and `t` is the time it travels.\n\n**2. State the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This means we need to find the minimum distance `L` that the particle `X^0` travels, within which at least 30% of an initial sample of `X^0` particles would have decayed.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n    Given:\n    Total Energy `E = 27` GeV\n    Rest Mass Energy `m_0 * c^2 = 3.41` GeV\n\n    `γ = E / (m_0 * c^2) = 27 / 3.41`\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame (τ_lab)**\n    We use the time dilation formula.\n    Given:\n    Proper lifetime `τ_0 = 8 × 10^(-16)` s\n\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_0 = (27 / 3.41) * (8 × 10^(-16) s)`\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Calculate the time `t` for 30% decay**\n    We need to find the time `t` at which the fraction of decayed particles is 0.30.\n    `Fraction_decayed = 1 - exp(-t / τ_lab) = 0.30`\n    `exp(-t / τ_lab) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70`\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `-t / τ_lab = ln(0.70)`\n    `t = -τ_lab * ln(0.70) = τ_lab * ln(1 / 0.70)`\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Calculate the particle's velocity (v)**\n    The velocity is related to the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n    Rearranging gives:\n    `v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ^2)`\n\n*   **Step 3.5: Calculate the minimum distance (L)**\n    The distance is `L = v * t`. Combining all the steps:\n    `L = (c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ^2)) * (γ * τ_0) * ln(1 / 0.70)`\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation using Python**\nTo ensure precision, let's perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants from the problem\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\ndecay_fraction = 0.30\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame (tau_lab)\ntau_lab = gamma * tau_0\n\n# 3. Calculate the time (t_min) required for the specified fraction to decay\nt_min = tau_lab * np.log(1 / (1 - decay_fraction))\n\n# 4. Calculate the particle's velocity (v) in the lab frame.\nbeta = np.sqrt(1 - 1 / gamma**2)\nv = beta * c\n\n# 5. Calculate the minimum distance (resolution) traveled in time t_min.\nL = v * t_min\n\nprint(f\"{L:.3e}\")\n```\nThe python code executes and computes the final result.\n6.719e-07\n\nThe calculation yields a result of `L = 6.719 × 10^(-7)` m.\n\n**5. Analysis of the Result and Options**\n\nThe calculated distance required to observe 30% of the decays is `0.672 × 10^(-6)` m. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nOur calculated value (`0.672e-6 m`) does not match any of the options. However, option C (`2.08e-6 m`) is of the same order of magnitude (`10^-6` m, or micrometers). The other options are vastly different. This suggests there might be a flaw in the problem statement or the options.\n\nLet's consider another important physical quantity: the **mean decay length (`λ`)**. This is the average distance a particle travels before decaying, which corresponds to the distance at which `1 - 1/e ≈ 63.2%` of particles have decayed.\n`λ = v * τ_lab`\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n`λ = (v) * (γ * τ_0) = (c * sqrt(1-1/γ^2)) * (γ * τ_0) = c * τ_0 * sqrt(γ^2 - 1)`\n`λ = (2.998e8 m/s) * (8e-16 s) * sqrt((27/3.41)^2 - 1) = 1.884 × 10^(-6)` m.\n\nThe mean decay length is `1.884 × 10^(-6)` m. This value is very close to option C, `2.08 × 10^(-6)` m. The discrepancy of about 10% is likely due to a minor inaccuracy in the values given in the problem statement. It is a common occurrence in physics problems that the intended question was about a key concept (like the mean decay length) rather than a more complex derived value.\n\nGiven that the rigorously calculated answer for 30% decay is not an option, and the mean decay length is very close to option C, it is most plausible that the question intended to ask for the mean decay length, and option C is the intended answer. A resolution of `2.08e-6 m` would allow for the observation of decays up to that track length, which would correspond to observing approximately 67% of all decays, satisfying the \"at least 30%\" condition.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance the particle `X^0` travels in the bubble chamber before it decays. The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. This implies we need to find the distance `L` within which 30% of a sample of `X^0` particles will have decayed.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`)**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (`E`) to its rest mass energy (`m₀c²`).\n    *   Total Energy, `E` = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy, `m₀c²` = 3.41 GeV\n\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n    `γ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Particle's Velocity (`v`)**\n    The velocity is related to the Lorentz factor. Since `γ` is significantly greater than 1, the velocity will be very close to the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))`\n    *   Rearranging for `β = v/c`:\n        `β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1 / (7.918)²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01595) ≈ 0.992`\n    *   So, `v = 0.992c`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame (`τ_lab`)**\n    Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ₀`).\n    *   Proper lifetime, `τ₀` = 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s\n\n    The formula for time dilation is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀ = 7.918 * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 6.334 × 10⁻¹⁵ s`\n    This `τ_lab` is the *mean lifetime* in the lab frame.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time (`t`) for 30% of Particles to Decay**\n    The number of particles remaining at time `t`, `N(t)`, follows an exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`.\n    The fraction of particles that have decayed by time `t` is `1 - (N(t)/N₀)`. We set this fraction to 0.30 (30%).\n    *   `0.30 = 1 - exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    *   `exp(-t / τ_lab) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `-t / τ_lab = ln(0.70) ≈ -0.3567`\n    *   `t = 0.3567 * τ_lab = 0.3567 * (6.334 × 10⁻¹⁵ s) ≈ 2.259 × 10⁻¹⁵ s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Distance (`L`) Traveled**\n    The distance traveled is simply `L = v * t`. This distance `L` is the track length that needs to be resolved by the detector.\n    *   `L = v * t = (0.992 * c) * (2.259 × 10⁻¹⁵ s)`\n    *   `L = (0.992 * 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) * (2.259 × 10⁻¹⁵ s) ≈ 6.72 × 10⁻⁷ m`\n\nThis result (`0.672 × 10⁻⁶ m`) does not match any of the provided options.\n\n**Alternative Interpretation: Mean Decay Length (`λ`)**\n\nIt's common in such problems that the intended question relates to a more fundamental characteristic, such as the **mean decay length**, `λ`. This is the average distance a particle travels before decaying, corresponding to `L = v * τ_lab`. At this distance, the fraction of decayed particles is `1 - 1/e ≈ 63.2%`, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition.\n\nLet's calculate the mean decay length:\n*   `λ = v * τ_lab = (0.992 * 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) * (6.334 × 10⁻¹⁵ s) ≈ 1.88 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\nThis value, `1.88 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is very close to option C. The small discrepancy (around 10%) is likely due to the specific values of `E`, `m₀`, or `τ₀` used in the problem statement being approximate or containing a typo. Given the options, this interpretation is the most plausible. A detector with a resolution of `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m` would be necessary to study decays happening over this characteristic length scale.\n\nTo perform the calculation with high precision, we use the following Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nE = 27  # GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # GeV\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # s\nc = 299792458  # m/s\n\n# 1. Lorentz factor\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# 2. Velocity\n# v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\n# No need to calculate v and tau_lab separately for mean decay length\n# 3. Mean decay length lambda = v * tau_lab = (c*beta) * (gamma*tau_0) = c*tau_0 * (beta*gamma)\n# Since beta = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)/gamma, then beta*gamma = sqrt(gamma^2-1)\nlambda_decay = c * tau_0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\nprint(f\"{lambda_decay:.3e}\")\n```\nThe python code executes and computes the final result.\n1.884e-06\nThe script calculates the mean decay length as `1.884 × 10⁻⁶ m`. This is extremely close to option C.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the question is most likely asking for the mean decay length, `λ`. Our calculated value of `λ ≈ 1.88 × 10⁻⁶ m` strongly suggests that `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m` is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the physics and calculations required to find the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the minimum distance (resolution) over which we need to be able to track the particle `X^0` in order to observe the decay for at least 30% of the particles. This means we need to calculate the distance `L` the particle `X^0` travels in a time `t`, during which 30% of an initial number of `X^0` particles would have decayed.\n\n### **2. Key Physics Concepts**\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This relates the total energy (E) of a particle to its rest mass energy (m₀c²). It is given by `γ = E / (m₀c²)`.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame (`τ_lab`) compared to its proper lifetime (`τ₀`). The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`. This `τ_lab` is the *mean lifetime* in the lab.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity (v):** The velocity is related to γ by `v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)`.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles follows the law `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `N(t)` is the number of particles remaining at time `t`, and `N₀` is the initial number.\n\n### **3. Initial Calculation (for exactly 30% decay)**\n\nLet's first calculate the distance required to see exactly 30% of the decays.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    `γ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918`\n\n2.  **Calculate the lab-frame mean lifetime (τ_lab):**\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀ = 7.918 * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 6.334 × 10⁻¹⁵ s`\n\n3.  **Find the time `t` for 30% of particles to decay:**\n    If 30% have decayed, 70% remain.\n    `N(t) / N₀ = 0.70 = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    Taking the natural log: `ln(0.70) = -t / τ_lab`\n    `t = -ln(0.70) * τ_lab ≈ 0.3567 * τ_lab ≈ 2.259 × 10⁻¹⁵ s`\n\n4.  **Calculate the distance `L`:**\n    `L = v * t`\n    We need the velocity `v`, which will be very close to `c`. From the first python execution (`Code output: 6.719e-07`), this distance is `L ≈ 0.672 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\nThis value does not match any of the options provided, suggesting a different interpretation of the question might be intended.\n\n### **4. Alternative Interpretation: Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nOften in particle physics problems, the most relevant characteristic distance is the **mean decay length (λ)**. This is the average distance a particle travels before it decays. It is calculated as `λ = v * τ_lab`.\n\n*   At a distance equal to the mean decay length, the fraction of particles that will have decayed is `1 - 1/e ≈ 0.632` or 63.2%.\n*   Since 63.2% is greater than 30%, a detector capable of resolving the mean decay length will certainly be able to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\".\n\nLet's calculate this mean decay length `λ`.\n\n1.  **Formula for λ:**\n    A more direct formula combines velocity and the time-dilated lifetime:\n    `λ = v * τ_lab = (c * β) * (γ * τ₀)`\n    where `β = v/c`. Since `βγ = sqrt(γ² - 1)`, the formula becomes:\n    `λ = c * τ₀ * sqrt(γ² - 1)`\n\n2.  **Calculation:**\n    We use the `γ` we calculated earlier (`γ ≈ 7.918`).\n    `λ = (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) * sqrt((7.918)² - 1)`\n    `λ ≈ (2.3984 × 10⁻⁷ m) * sqrt(62.69 - 1)`\n    `λ ≈ (2.3984 × 10⁻⁷ m) * 7.854`\n    `λ ≈ 1.884 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\nThis calculation was performed accurately by the second Python script, which yielded the output `1.884e-06`.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated mean decay length, `λ = 1.884 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is extremely close to option C (`2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`). The small difference is likely due to minor rounding or inaccuracies in the problem's given values. Therefore, the question is best interpreted as asking for the mean decay length, which represents the characteristic distance one must be able to resolve to study these decays effectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
