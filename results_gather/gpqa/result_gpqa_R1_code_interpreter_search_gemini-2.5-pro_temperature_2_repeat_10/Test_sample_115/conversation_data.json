    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\nCompound A has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals:\n1.  A triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating to 6H.\n2.  A quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating to 4H.\n\nThe integration ratio is 6H:4H, which simplifies to 3:2. The splitting pattern (triplet and quartet) and the integration ratio are characteristic of ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).\n*   The 6H signal corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups (2 x CH3). The signal is a triplet, which means the adjacent carbon has 2 protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3). This fits a -CH2-CH3 group.\n*   The 4H signal corresponds to two equivalent methylene groups (2 x CH2). The signal is a quartet, which means the adjacent carbon has 3 protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4). This also fits a -CH2-CH3 group.\n\nSince the compound shows only these two signals, it must be composed of two equivalent, isolated ethyl groups. The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm, 1.3 ppm) are typical for an alkane. The simplest symmetrical alkane that fits this description is n-butane (CH3CH2-CH2CH3). In n-butane, the two terminal CH3 groups are equivalent (6H), and the two internal CH2 groups are equivalent (4H). The CH3 signal is a triplet (coupled to the CH2 group). The CH2 signal is coupled to both the adjacent CH3 (3H) and the other CH2 (2H), so it should technically be a multiplet (sextet). However, in many introductory problems, this complex signal is simplified or approximated as a quartet. Given the context of the subsequent reactions, **n-butane** is the most logical identity for Compound A.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\nCompound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation. There are two possible products: 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane. The reaction proceeds via the most stable radical intermediate. A secondary radical (at C2) is more stable than a primary radical (at C1). Therefore, the major product will be 2-bromobutane.\nCompound B is **2-bromobutane** (CH3-CHBr-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\nCompound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction (E2 elimination). The base removes a proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the bromine.\n*   Removal of a proton from C1 gives but-1-ene (CH2=CH-CH2-CH3).\n*   Removal of a proton from C3 gives but-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3).\n\nAccording to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. But-2-ene is more substituted than but-1-ene. The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-1-ene does not have geometrical isomers, whereas but-2-ene exists as *cis*- and *trans*-isomers. This confirms that Compound C is **but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: The Diels-Alder Reaction and Identification of Compound D**\nThe problem states that the *cis-isomer* of C, **cis-but-2-ene**, reacts with **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, or Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n*   **Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene.\n*   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. The IUPAC name implies the structure is HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3.\n    *   (3E) configuration: The high-priority groups on C3 (-CH=CHOH) and C4 (-CH3) are on opposite sides of the C3=C4 double bond.\n    *   (1E) configuration: The high-priority groups on C1 (-OH) and C2 (-CH=CHCH3) are on opposite sides of the C1=C2 double bond.\n    *   For the reaction, the diene must adopt an s-cis conformation. In this conformation, the substituents at C1 (-OH) and C4 (-CH3) both point \"outward\".\n\n**Predicting the Stereochemistry of the Product D:**\n\nThe product is a cyclohexene ring formed from the four carbons of the diene and the two carbons of the dienophile. The resulting structure is a **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol**. This allows us to eliminate options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (4,6,6-trimethyl).\n\nTo determine the correct stereoisomer (option B or C), we use the rules of stereoselectivity for the Diels-Alder reaction:\n1.  **Stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained:** Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (at the future C5 and C6 positions of the product) must be *cis* to each other.\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the diene is retained:** The two \"out\" substituents on the diene (-OH at C1 and -CH3 at C4) will be *cis* to each other in the product.\n3.  **Endo Rule:** The reaction proceeds through a transition state that maximizes orbital overlap. This is the \"endo\" approach, where the substituents of the dienophile are positioned under the plane of the diene. This places the dienophile's methyl groups (at C5 and C6) on the opposite face of the ring from the diene's \"out\" substituents (-OH at C1 and -CH3 at C4).\n\n**Summary of Relative Stereochemistry:**\n*   The -OH at C1 is *cis* to the -CH3 at C4.\n*   The -CH3 at C5 is *cis* to the -CH3 at C6.\n*   The pair {-OH, C4-CH3} is *trans* to the pair {C5-CH3, C6-CH3}.\n\n**Assigning Absolute Configuration (R/S):**\nThe options provide absolute configurations, all starting with (1S). Let's determine the full configuration for the enantiomer that starts with (1S), based on the relative stereochemistry derived above.\n\nLet's draw the molecule with \"up\" groups (wedge) and \"down\" groups (dash):\n*   -OH at C1 (up, wedge), -CH3 at C4 (up, wedge)\n*   -CH3 at C5 (down, dash), -CH3 at C6 (down, dash)\n*   The hydrogens at each chiral center will have the opposite orientation.\n\nNow we assign R/S for this (endo) product:\n*   **C1:** H is dash (back). Priorities: OH(1) > C2(2) > C6(3). The path 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. Configuration is **S**. Matches the options.\n*   **C4:** H is dash (back). Priorities: C3(1) > C5(2) > -CH3(3). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise. Configuration is **R**. So we have (1S, 4R).\n*   **C5:** H is wedge (front). Priorities: C6(1) > C4(2) > -CH3(3). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise. Since H is in the front, we reverse the configuration. R becomes **S**. So we have (1S, 4R, 5S).\n*   **C6:** H is wedge (front). Priorities: C1(1) > C5(2) > -CH3(3). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise. Since H is in the front, we reverse the configuration. R becomes **S**. So we have (1S, 4R, 5S, 6S).\n\nThe predicted product D from the endo-selective Diels-Alder reaction has the configuration **(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
