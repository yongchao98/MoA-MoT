    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This peak is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is forming a hydrogen-bonded dimer. The broadness is a key feature. This signal often overlaps with C-H stretching absorptions.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The FTIR data strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data confirms the class of compound but does not help distinguish between the specific isomers. The deciding information must come from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Key splitting patterns:** The spectrum shows two particularly complex signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThese complex splitting patterns (multiplets) arise when a proton is magnetically coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons. The multiplicity of the signal for a proton (let's call it H_A) coupled to a group of 'n' equivalent protons (H_B) is given by the **n+1 rule**.\n*   Doublet (d): Coupled to 1 proton (n=1).\n*   Triplet (t): Coupled to 2 protons (n=2).\n*   Quartet (q): Coupled to 3 protons (n=3).\n\nA **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means one proton is coupled to:\n*   One neighboring proton (giving the doublet).\n*   A set of two neighboring protons (giving the triplet).\n*   A set of three neighboring protons (giving the quartet).\n\nA **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means one proton is coupled to:\n*   One neighboring proton (giving the doublet).\n*   A set of two neighboring protons (giving one triplet).\n*   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (giving the second triplet).\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of Each Option\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain. We'll focus on 3-bond (vicinal) couplings.\n\n**A) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** Interpreting the formula string from left to right as a continuous chain with branches gives `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** To name this, we find the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. That chain is 5 carbons long (the pentanoic acid chain is `HOOC-CH2-CH-CH-CH3`). There are ethyl substituents at positions 3 and 4. The name is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to three groups of vicinal protons:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → quartet (q)\n        3.  The protons of the methylene (CH2) group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **H at C3:** This proton is also coupled to three groups of vicinal protons:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the methylene group at C2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the methylene (CH2) group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is an excellent candidate as it is predicted to have both of the complex signals observed in the spectrum.\n\n**B) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H), CH2 at C2 (2H), and CH3 on C3 (3H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and the two methyl groups (6H). This gives a **doublet of septets (d-sept)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtq`, but it lacks the `dtt` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and its methyl group protons (3H). This gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H) and CH2 at C4 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure does not have a `dtq` or a `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n**D) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\n*   **Structure:** `CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Splitting Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H), CH2 at C4 (2H), and its ethyl CH2 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H) and its ethyl CH2 (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtt` but lacks the required `dtq` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n### Final Identification\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only the structure corresponding to option A, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, will produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
