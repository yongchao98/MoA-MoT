    "This problem requires us to apply the principles of quantum mechanics for identical fermions in a potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle of mass 'm' in this potential are given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nLet's calculate the first few energy levels:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe problem states we have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**. Fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\nA quantum state in this system is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number *n* and the spin magnetic quantum number *m<sub>s</sub>* (which can be +1/2 for spin-up, ↑, or -1/2 for spin-down, ↓).\n\nThis means that for each energy level *E<sub>n</sub>*, there are two available quantum states: (n, ↑) and (n, ↓). Consequently, each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n### 3. Calculating the State Energies\n\nWe will find the total energy of the system by summing the energies of the four particles for each state.\n\n#### Ground State Energy ($E_{gs}$)\nThe ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the lowest one upwards.\n*   **Level E<sub>1</sub> (n=1, energy=1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level E<sub>2</sub> (n=2, energy=4E):** We have two more particles to place, so they go into this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe configuration for the ground state is:\n*   Two particles in n=1.\n*   Two particles in n=2.\n\nThe total ground state energy is:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We can achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe configuration for the first excited state is:\n*   Two particles in n=1 (energy 1E).\n*   One particle in n=2 (energy 4E).\n*   One particle in n=3 (energy 9E).\n\nThe total first excited state energy is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)\nThe second excited state has the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the second-lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **Excitation 1 (already found):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = 15E. (This is the **first excited state**).\n*   **Excitation 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Excitation 3:** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited configurations (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E and the second lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
