    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Experimental Data**\n\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 g and decomposes upon heating into only a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This is used to absorb acidic gases (e.g., CO2, SO2, NO2, N2O). Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remained at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\n    *   The total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of products = mass(H2O) + mass(O2) + mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + mass(C)\n    *   mass(C) = 7.20 - 4.40 = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now calculate the molar mass of gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(C) = mass(C) / moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A common gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that does not react with the absorbents is nitrogen (N2). So, **Gas C is N2**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\n    *   The products of the decomposition are N2, H2O, and O2. Therefore, the original salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Let's find the total moles of each element in the products, which must equal the total moles in the initial salt mixture:\n        *   **Moles of H atoms:** 0.20 mol H2O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H2O) = 0.4 mol H.\n        *   **Moles of N atoms:** 0.10 mol N2 × (2 mol N / 1 mol N2) = 0.2 mol N.\n        *   **Moles of O atoms:** (0.20 mol H2O × 1 O) + (0.025 mol O2 × 2 O) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    *   The problem states it is an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's find the overall empirical formula of the combined salts.\n    *   The mole ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20: (0.2 * 20) : (0.4 * 20) : (0.25 * 20) = 4 : 8 : 5.\n    *   So, the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N4H8O5**.\n    *   We need to partition these atoms into two plausible salts that decompose into gases. Since the salts contain N and H, they are likely ammonium salts.\n    *   The H8 suggests the presence of two ammonium cations, `(NH4)2+`, which would account for N2H8.\n    *   The remaining atoms are `N4H8O5 - N2H8 = N2O5`. These atoms must form the two anions of the salts.\n    *   The common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrite (NO2⁻) and nitrate (NO3⁻).\n    *   Let's check if they fit: `NO2⁻ + NO3⁻ = N2O5²⁻`. This perfectly matches the remaining atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are formed by combining one `NH4⁺` with `NO2⁻` and the other `NH4⁺` with `NO3⁻`.\n        *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)**\n        *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)**\n\n5.  **Verify the Decomposition and Stoichiometry**\n\n    *   Let's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts yields the observed products. At the given temperature and conditions, plausible reactions are:\n        *   `NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O`\n        *   `2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O` (A decomposition pathway for NH4NO3 that yields N2 and O2).\n    *   If we start with `n` moles of NH4NO2 and `n` moles of NH4NO3 (equimolar):\n        *   From `n` mol NH4NO2: produces `n` mol N2 and `2n` mol H2O.\n        *   From `n` mol NH4NO3: produces `n` mol N2, `n/2` mol O2, and `2n` mol H2O.\n    *   Total Moles of Products:\n        *   Total N2 = `n + n = 2n`\n        *   Total H2O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n        *   Total O2 = `n/2`\n    *   The ratio of products is `N2 : H2O : O2` = `2n : 4n : n/2`, which simplifies to `4 : 8 : 1`.\n    *   Let's check the ratio from our experimental data:\n        *   `n(N2) : n(H2O) : n(O2)` = `0.10 : 0.20 : 0.025`. Dividing by 0.025 gives the ratio `4 : 8 : 1`.\n    *   The ratios match perfectly, confirming our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH4NO2):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH4NO3):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
