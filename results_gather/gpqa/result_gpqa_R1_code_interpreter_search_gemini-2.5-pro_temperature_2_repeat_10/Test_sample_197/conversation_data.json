    "The problem is to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\n**1. Identify the Species and Equilibria**\nThe cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN^-`) to form a series of complexes. The formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (`βn`). The relevant species are:\n*   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]^+` (mono-complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)2]` (di-complex, the species of interest)\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^-` (tri-complex)\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)` (tetra-complex)\n\nThe formation reactions and their stability constants are:\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^(2-)` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Formulate the Molar Fraction Expression**\nThe molar fraction of a specific complex, `αn`, is its concentration divided by the total concentration of the metal ion, `c(Co)`. We are interested in `α2` for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)]`\n\nUsing the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1[Co^2+][SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^(2-)] = β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the total concentration equation:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\nFactoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+](1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nThe molar fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]` is `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`.\n`α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+](1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n`α2 = (β2[SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3. Substitute Values and Calculate**\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN^-]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β1` = 9\n*   `β2` = 40\n*   `β3` = 63\n*   `β4` = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the expression:\n*   Numerator: `β2[SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1[SCN^-]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2[SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3[SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4[SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nSum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.92%`\n\nThis result matches the provided python code output (`16.91618...%`).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
