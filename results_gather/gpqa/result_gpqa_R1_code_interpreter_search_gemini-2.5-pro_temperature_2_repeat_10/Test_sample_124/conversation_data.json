    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is described by the potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, this potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is a separable potential, meaning the Schrödinger equation can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator equations.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i$ is a non-negative integer quantum number.\n\nFor a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent one-dimensional oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$). The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the first few states:\n1.  **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $n=0$. The only possible combination of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sums to 0 is $(0, 0, 0)$.\n    *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   This state is non-degenerate.\n\n2.  **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$. The possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 1)$.\n    *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   There are 3 possible states with this energy, so the degeneracy is 3.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$. The possible combinations are $(2, 0, 0)$ and its permutations (3 states), and $(1, 1, 0)$ and its permutations (3 states). Total states: $3+3=6$.\n    *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The degeneracy is 6.\n\n4.  **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$. We need to find the number of ways to write 3 as the sum of three non-negative integers. This is a classic combinatorics problem (\"stars and bars\"). The number of combinations is given by the formula $g_n = \\frac{(n+k-1)!}{n!(k-1)!}$ where n is the number to be partitioned (our n) and k is the number of parts (3 for x,y,z). So the degeneracy is $g_n = \\frac{(n+2)!}{n!2!} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$.\n    *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   Degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions): Let's calculate the degeneracy for $n=3$ using the formula:\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    We can also list the states explicitly:\n    *   $(3, 0, 0)$ and its permutations: $(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3)$ -> 3 states.\n    *   $(2, 1, 0)$ and its permutations: $(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2)$ -> 6 states.\n    *   $(1, 1, 1)$ -> 1 state.\n    *   Total degeneracy = $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nSo, for the third excited state ($n=3$):\n*   The energy value is $E_3 = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   The number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n\nOption A matches our calculated energy and degeneracy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
