    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics**\n\nThe problem describes radiation from an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that has a specific \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis (z-axis). This radiation is measured in the far-field (radiation zone). We need to determine two things:\na) The fraction of maximum power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\nb) The dependence of the radiated power `f` on the wavelength `λ`.\n\nThe solution lies in identifying the dominant mode of radiation (dipole, quadrupole, etc.) and knowing its characteristic properties.\n\n**2. Analyze the Possible Radiation Modes**\n\nAny oscillating charge distribution can be described by a multipole expansion. The most common sources of radiation are:\n*   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** This is often the dominant term. It occurs when the center of charge of the distribution oscillates.\n*   **Magnetic Dipole Radiation:** This occurs if there is an oscillating current loop.\n*   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** This becomes dominant if the dipole moments (both electric and magnetic) are zero or non-radiating. This typically happens in systems with high symmetry, for instance, when the shape of a charge distribution oscillates while its center remains fixed.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Electric Dipole Model**\n\nThis is the simplest and most fundamental model. Let's assume the spheroid, as a whole, is oscillating along the z-axis. This creates an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n*   **Angular Dependence:** The power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle from the z-axis.\n\n*   **Fraction of Power:**\n    *   The power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. This occurs at `θ = 90°`, where `sin²(90°) = 1`. This maximum power is `A`.\n    *   At `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power is `(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power A) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The total power radiated by an electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω⁴`. Since `ω = 2πc/λ`, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    So, `f ∝ λ⁻⁴`.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Dipole Model:** This model gives a fraction of **1/4** and a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**. This combination matches **Option C**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Electric Quadrupole Model**\n\nNow, let's consider the specific information given: \"spheroid in shape\". This might be a hint to consider a more complex mode. A spheroid is a centrosymmetric shape. If the charge distribution oscillates by changing its shape (e.g., oscillating between being a prolate spheroid and an oblate spheroid) while its center remains fixed, its electric dipole moment would be zero. The first non-zero radiating term would be the electric quadrupole moment.\n\nA common textbook model for such an axial oscillation is the linear electric quadrupole.\n\n*   **Angular Dependence:** The power radiated per unit solid angle for a linear electric quadrupole oriented along the z-axis is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n\n*   **Fraction of Power:** To find the fraction, we must first find the maximum of this function. Let `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ) = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`. The maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1, which occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\n    *   The maximum power `A` is proportional to `g(45°) = sin²(45°)cos²(45°) = (1/√2)² * (1/√2)² = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4`.\n    *   At `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power is `(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power A) = (3/16) / (1/4) = 3/4`.\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The power radiated by an electric quadrupole is proportional to `ω⁶`. Since `ω ∝ 1/λ`, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁶ = λ⁻⁶`.\n    So, `f ∝ λ⁻⁶`.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Quadrupole Model:** This model gives a fraction of **3/4** and a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁶**. This combination matches **Option A**.\n\n**5. Choosing the Best Model**\n\nWe have two physically consistent scenarios leading to options A and C.\n*   **Option C** corresponds to the simplest case (electric dipole).\n*   **Option A** corresponds to a more complex case (electric quadrupole) that is strongly suggested by the specific geometry (\"spheroid\") provided in the problem. In physics problems, specific information is rarely irrelevant. The fact that a shape oscillation of a centrosymmetric object is naturally quadrupolar makes this the more likely intended answer. It demonstrates a deeper understanding of multipole radiation.\n\nTherefore, the quadrupole model is the better interpretation of the problem statement.\n\n*   Fraction of maximum power at `30°`: **3/4**\n*   Possible form of `f`: dependence on **λ⁻⁶**\n\nThis corresponds to Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
