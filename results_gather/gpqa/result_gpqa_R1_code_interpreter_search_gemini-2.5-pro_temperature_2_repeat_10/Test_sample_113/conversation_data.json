    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for selecting the suitable reagents for each reaction:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves adding a cyanide group (from NaCN) and a hydrogen atom across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond of butan-2-one. The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, is a type of compound called a cyanohydrin. This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophile is the cyanide ion, CN⁻, provided by the dissociation of NaCN.\n    *   The CN⁻ attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   `CH₃C(O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻  ⇌  CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin.\n    *   `CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺  →  CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** must be a source of protons (an acid).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   **NaHSO₃ (Sodium bisulfite):** This reagent undergoes its own characteristic addition reaction with ketones but is not used as the acid source in cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **H₃O⁺ (Hydronium ion):** This represents an acidic aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water). It is the necessary source of protons to complete the cyanohydrin formation. Although using a strong acid directly with NaCN can be hazardous (liberating HCN gas), the reaction is typically performed by adding acid to a mixture of the ketone and NaCN to generate the necessary proton donor *in situ*. H₃O⁺ is the correct general representation for this acid source.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Reagent **A is H₃O⁺**.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction transforms a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), while the rest of the molecule (the α-hydroxy group and the aromatic rings) remains unchanged. This transformation is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires heating in the presence of water and a strong catalyst, which can be either a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Acidic Hydrolysis:** R-C≡N + 2 H₂O + H₃O⁺ (catalyst) → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n    *   **Basic Hydrolysis:** R-C≡N + H₂O + OH⁻ (catalyst) → R-COO⁻ + NH₃ (followed by an acidic workup to get R-COOH)\n    *   Reagent **B**, in combination with water (H₂O), acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and is a very common and effective reagent for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under heating.\n    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under standard conditions. The reaction would be extremely slow or incomplete.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The much more suitable reagent **B is HCl**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   Reagent A = H₃O⁺\n*   Reagent B = HCl\n\nMatching this with the given choices:\nA) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\nB) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\nC) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\nD) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
