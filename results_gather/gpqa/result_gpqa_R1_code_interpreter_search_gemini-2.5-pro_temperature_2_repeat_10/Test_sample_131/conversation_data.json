    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This is a crucial starting point.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound produces an aromatic signal of equal total proton integration. The fact that there are *two* signals means the signals from each compound are at different chemical shifts.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. There are no other types of signals (like doublets, triplets, or quartets). The total spectrum is the sum of the signals from the two compounds.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each candidate compound's expected 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    We need to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and integration for each of the four options based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: It is a para-disubstituted benzene ring, which is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. This would produce **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. An ethyl group gives a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-).\n        *   Conclusion: The presence of a quartet and a triplet contradicts the experimental data, which states there are only *singlets* in the alkyl region. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as **one singlet** (2H). (This is an AA' system, which appears as a singlet).\n        *   Alkyl protons: Symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent. These two pairs are not equivalent to each other. This results in **two singlets** (6H each).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule has no symmetry. All protons are in unique chemical environments.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons (at C4 and C6) are not equivalent. Each has two methyl neighbors, so they are not split. This results in **two singlets** (1H each).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups are all non-equivalent. This results in **four singlets** (3H each).\n        *   Conclusion: If this compound were present, it would by itself produce two aromatic singlets and four alkyl singlets. This contradicts the mixture's data (two aromatic singlets total, three alkyl singlets total). So this compound cannot be in the mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the correct pair:**\n    From the analysis above, we have eliminated 1,4-diethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The only remaining possibilities are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two fits the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio)\n\n    *   **Predicted Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (for 2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes one singlet (for 2H).\n        *   Combined: **Two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the signals will have an integration ratio of **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Predicted Alkyl Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (for 12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes two singlets (each for 6H).\n        *   Combined: **Three singlets**. The relative proton integration will be 12H : 6H : 6H. Dividing by the smallest number (6) gives an integration ratio of **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that matches all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
