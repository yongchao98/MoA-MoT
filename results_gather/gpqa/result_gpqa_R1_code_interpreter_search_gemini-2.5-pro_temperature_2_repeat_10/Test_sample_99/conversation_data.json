    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A (C3H6) and its reaction with Br2/CCl4 to form B.**\n    *   The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to the general formula for alkenes (CnH2n). The reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4) is a characteristic test for unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Cycloalkanes can also have this formula, but propene is the more likely candidate for this addition reaction.\n    *   **A is Propene (CH3-CH=CH2).**\n    *   Propene undergoes electrophilic addition with bromine to give 1,2-dibromopropane.\n    *   CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   **B is 1,2-dibromopropane.**\n\n2.  **Identify Compound C from the reaction of B with alcoholic KOH.**\n    *   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base. This reagent is used for dehydrohalogenation, which is the elimination of HBr. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, two molecules of HBr will be eliminated to form an alkyne.\n    *   CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alc.) --> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   **C is Propyne.**\n\n3.  **Identify Compound D by passing C through a red-hot iron tube.**\n    *   Passing an alkyne through a red-hot iron tube at high temperatures causes cyclic polymerization. Three molecules of the alkyne trimerize to form an aromatic compound.\n    *   Three molecules of propyne (CH3-C≡CH) will cyclize to form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n    *   **D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as Mesitylene).**\n\n4.  **Identify Compound E from the reaction of D with a mixture of two strong acids.**\n    *   \"A mixture of two strong acids\" in the context of aromatic chemistry typically refers to the nitrating mixture, which is concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This performs nitration on the aromatic ring.\n    *   Mesitylene (D) reacts with the nitrating mixture. The three methyl groups are activating and ortho-, para-directing. All available positions (2, 4, 6) are equivalent and are activated. Nitration occurs at one of these positions.\n    *   **E is 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (or Nitromesitylene).**\n\n5.  **Identify Compound F from the reaction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid.**\n    *   The reaction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl) is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E) is reduced to 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n    *   **F is 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (or Mesitylamine/Mesidine).**\n\n6.  **Identify Compound G from the reaction of F with nitrous acid.**\n    *   Compound F is an aromatic primary amine. It reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, typically made in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at cold temperatures (0-5 °C) in a reaction called diazotization. This forms a diazonium salt.\n    *   **G is the Mesitylenediazonium salt (e.g., [C6H2(CH3)3N2]Cl).**\n\n7.  **Identify Compound H from the reaction of G with sodium hydroxide.**\n    *   The diazonium salt (G) is warmed in the presence of water (here specified with NaOH, which makes the solution basic and facilitates the reaction) to replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (or Mesitol).**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically gives a purple, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored complex. However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the two methyl groups at the ortho positions (positions 2 and 6) cause significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the phenol from forming the colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺). Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol does not give a positive ferric chloride test. The solution would just retain the yellow/brownish color of the aqueous ferric chloride solution, which signifies a negative result. The statement that it \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading and implies a specific positive reaction, which does not occur. Thus, this statement is considered incorrect in a chemical context.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   F is Mesitylamine, an aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are fundamental building blocks for azo dyes, which are a large class of synthetic colorants. The amine is diazotized (as in step 6) and then coupled with another aromatic ring to form a dye. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). This molecule is highly symmetrical. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and do not split each other. They appear as one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent. Neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. Therefore, the spectrum consists of two singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard room temperature and pressure. Like most small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStatements B, C, and D are factually correct. Statement A is incorrect because 2,4,6-trimethylphenol does not give a positive ferric chloride test due to steric hindrance; the \"yellow color\" is merely the color of the unreacted reagent, not the product of a characteristic reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
