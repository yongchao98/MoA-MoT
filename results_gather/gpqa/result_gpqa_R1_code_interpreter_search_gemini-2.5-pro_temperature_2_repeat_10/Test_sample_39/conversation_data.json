    "This is a common piece of jargon used in organic chemistry labs. The phrase \"on top of each other\" almost always refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, which is the most common technique for separating and purifying compounds in a synthetic organic chemistry lab.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core technique:** The primary method for separating compounds in this context is chromatography, such as Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography. This technique separates molecules based on their differing affinities for a stationary phase (e.g., polar silica gel) and a mobile phase (a less polar solvent system called the eluent).\n\n2.  **Relate the technique to the options:**\n    *   A compound's **polarity** is the key property that determines how it behaves during chromatography.\n    *   Polar compounds stick strongly to the polar stationary phase and move slowly.\n    *   Nonpolar compounds are more soluble in the mobile phase and move quickly.\n    *   If two compounds have very **similar polarities**, they will move at nearly the same speed.\n    *   On a TLC plate, which is used to visualize the separation, these compounds will appear as spots that are very close together, or literally \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that they cannot be separated using that particular chromatography system.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is measured with a polarimeter. It is not a separation technique itself. While diastereomers can be separated by chromatography, having similar optical rotations is not the direct cause of the separation failure described.\n    *   **B) Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult. While plausible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative and commonly used for the visual result of a failed chromatographic separation (i.e., overlapping spots on a TLC plate).\n    *   **C) Non-covalent interactions:** These interactions are the fundamental *reason* why chromatography works. Differences in these interactions allow for separation. Simply stating that the compounds interact doesn't explain the failure of the experiment. The problem is that the *net* interactions with the stationary and mobile phases are too similar between the different compounds.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemist is expressing frustration that they cannot separate their compounds (e.g., the desired product from a starting material or a byproduct) using chromatography. The most direct chemical reason for this failure is that the compounds have similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
