    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The common signs of chirality are the presence of a stereocenter (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Compounds for which a specific enantiomer (e.g., using R/S notation) is named are assumed to be in that enantiomerically pure form, which will be optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule does not have any stereocenters (chiral carbons).\n    *   The plane containing the atoms of the double bond (C=C) and the atoms directly attached to them (`Cl`, `H`, `C` of methyl, `C` of ethyl) is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, `(3aR,7aS)`, and the geometry of a double bond, `(E)`.\n    *   The presence of defined stereocenters in a complex structure like this is a strong indication of chirality. Given its complexity, it is extremely unlikely that the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would make it a meso compound.\n    *   The name designates a single, specific stereoisomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and is specified as a single stereoisomer, making it **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   Let's examine the structure with the specified stereochemistry (2R,3S). The substituents on C2 are `H`, `CH3`, `COOH`, and `CH(CH3)COOH`. The substituents on C3 are the same.\n    *   In the (2R,3S) diastereomer, the two chiral centers have opposite configurations. We can draw a Fischer projection or visualize it in 3D.\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n      CH3----|----H   (R)\n               |\n         H----|----CH3  (S)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule possesses a center of inversion halfway along the C2-C3 bond. Due to this symmetry element, the molecule is achiral, even though it contains stereocenters. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. Both stereocenters have the same (R) configuration.\n    *   Let's draw its Fischer projection:\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n      CH3----|----H   (R)\n               |\n      CH3----|----H   (R)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer ((2R,3R)), it is not a racemic mixture.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=CH-` (pathway C2-C3-C4), and (4) `-CH2-CH=CH-` (pathway C6-C5-C4). Since the two pathways around the ring are different, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule is chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` specifies the relative stereochemistry.\n    *   There are only two possible stereoisomers for 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexanes when the three substituents are identical.\n        *   **Isomer A (all-cis):** All three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all pointing 'up'). This can exist in a chair conformation with all three -OH groups being axial, or, after a ring flip, all being equatorial. In both cases, the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. It is achiral (a meso compound).\n        *   **Isomer B (cis-trans):** Two -OH groups are on one side and one is on the other side (e.g., up, up, down). This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon bearing the unique substituent (the 'down' one) and the carbon opposite to it. It is also achiral (a meso compound).\n    *   Since all possible stereoisomers of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol are achiral, this compound is **optically inactive** regardless of the specific isomer denoted by (1s,3s,5s).\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for any stereocenters. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the chain or the ring is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through the carbonyl group `C=O`, the `CH2`, the `CH` of the isopropyl group, and the symmetry plane of the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry and no stereocenters, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Optically Active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Optically Inactive:\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
