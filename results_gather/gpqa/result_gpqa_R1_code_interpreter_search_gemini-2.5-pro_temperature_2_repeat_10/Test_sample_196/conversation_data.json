    "*   **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Identify Compound X**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption in the range of `3400–2500 cm⁻¹` is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong, sharp absorption at `1720 cm⁻¹` corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Absorptions at `1610 cm⁻¹` and `1450 cm⁻¹` are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: A broad singlet (bs) appearing far downfield (>10 ppm) is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two doublets (d) in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   Let's analyze the alkyl substituent signals:\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet integrating to 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet integrating to 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons is the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl part.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine (-CH-) group. It is attached to the aromatic ring, the methyl group (1.4 ppm signal), and the ethyl group's methylene (1.7 ppm signal). This arrangement describes a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para arrangement.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined IR and NMR data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (B), but the question asks for the final product of the reaction.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of several functional groups, including carbonyls and alcohols, down to the corresponding alkane. Critically, it will reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n        *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n        *   Product: The product will be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement. The systematic name is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    1.  Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    2.  The reaction with Red P / HI reduces the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    3.  The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    4.  Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
