    "This problem requires a two-step check for each star:\n1.  **Is the star observable from the Paranal Observatory?** The observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude approx. -24.6°). A star must rise to a reasonable altitude above the horizon to be observed. Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of almost +90° and is therefore never visible from Paranal. All other listed stars are on the celestial equator (Declination = 0°) or in the southern celestial hemisphere (Canopus, Declination ≈ -53°) and are observable.\n\n2.  **Is the star bright enough?** A star is considered detectable if its observation can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a one-hour exposure. We must determine the limiting apparent magnitude (m_V) for this condition using the ESPRESSO instrument on a single 8m VLT.\n\nBased on the official ESPRESSO documentation (specifically the performance tables in the User Manual), for a 1-hour exposure with one VLT unit, an S/N of 10 is achieved for stars with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately V ≈ 17.2. Therefore, any observable star with `m_V <= 17.2` will be detectable.\n\nNow, we evaluate each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   Observability: Yes, its declination of -53° makes it easily visible from Paranal.\n    *   Brightness: Its apparent magnitude is m_V = -0.74, which is much brighter than the 17.2 limit.\n    *   Result: **Detectable.**\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   Observability: **No.** Its declination of +89° means it never rises above the horizon at Paranal.\n    *   Result: **Not Detectable.**\n\nFor stars (c) through (f), we first calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V) from their absolute magnitude (M_V = 15) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10 pc)`. All these stars have a declination of 0°, making them observable from Paranal.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15`. This is brighter than 17.2.\n    *   Result: **Detectable.**\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.5`. This is fainter than 17.2.\n    *   Result: **Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 13.5`. This is brighter than 17.2.\n    *   Result: **Detectable.**\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 18.5`.

    "Based on the analysis, a star's detectability by the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory depends on two key factors:\n\n1.  **Observability:** The star must rise to a sufficient altitude in the sky as seen from the observatory's location in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude ~ -24.6°). A star with a large positive declination, like Polaris (+89°), will never be visible. Stars on the celestial equator (Dec = 0°) or in the southern celestial hemisphere are observable.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a one-hour exposure. According to the official ESPRESSO performance documentation for the specified observing mode (1-UT), this corresponds to a limiting apparent magnitude of approximately **V ≈ 17.2**. Any star with an apparent magnitude `m_V <= 17.2` meets this criterion.\n\nHere is the evaluation for each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   Observability: **Yes**. Its declination is -52.7°, making it easily observable from Paranal.\n    *   Brightness: **Yes**. Its apparent magnitude is `m_V = -0.74`, which is much brighter than the 17.2 limit.\n    *   **Result: Detectable.**\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   Observability: **No**. Its declination is +89.3°. It is circumpolar around the North Celestial Pole and never rises above the horizon at Paranal's southern latitude.\n    *   **Result: Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc** (M_V = 15):\n    *   Observability: **Yes**. Its declination is 0°, making it observable.\n    *   Brightness: **Yes**. Its apparent magnitude is calculated as `m_V = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15.0`, which is brighter than 17.2.\n    *   **Result: Detectable.**\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc** (M_V = 15):\n    *   Observability: **Yes**. Its declination is 0°.\n    *   Brightness: **No**. Its apparent magnitude is `m_V = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) ≈ 21.5`, which is fainter than 17.2.\n    *   **Result: Not Detectable.**\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc** (M_V = 15):\n    *   Observability: **Yes**. Its declination is 0°.\n    *   Brightness: **Yes**. Its apparent magnitude is `m_V = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) ≈ 13.5`, which is brighter than 17.2.\n    *   **Result: Detectable.**\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc** (M_V = 15):\n    *   Observability: **Yes**. Its declination is 0°.\n    *   Brightness: **No**. Its apparent magnitude is `m_V = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) ≈ 18.5`, which is fainter than 17.2.\n    *   **Result: Not Detectable.**\n\nIn summary, the detectable stars are (a) Canopus, (c) the star at 10 pc, and (e) the star at 5 pc. This gives a total of 3 detectable stars.\n\n<<<A>>>"
