    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to understand the initial state, the final state, and the physical principles governing the process.\n    *   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, m1 and m2. They are moving and thus have kinetic energy.\n    *   **Given Conditions:**\n        *   `m1 = 2 * m2` (Fragment 1 is the more massive one).\n        *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n        *   The process is spontaneous fission, so no external energy is added.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated relativistically and classically. `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before must equal the total energy after.\n        *   `E_initial = Mc^2`.\n        *   `E_final = E1 + E2 = (m1c^2 + T1) + (m2c^2 + T2)`.\n        *   Therefore, `Mc^2 = m1c^2 + m2c^2 + T1 + T2`.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is zero (nucleus at rest). The final total momentum must also be zero.\n        *   `p_initial = 0`.\n        *   `p_final = p1 + p2 = 0`. This implies the fragments move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Calculation Plan:**\n    a.  Calculate the rest masses (or more conveniently, the rest energies) of the two fragments, `m1c^2` and `m2c^2`.\n    b.  Calculate the total kinetic energy released in the fission, `Q = T1 + T2`.\n    c.  Calculate `T1_classical` using classical mechanics (`T = p^2/(2m)`).\n    d.  Calculate `T1_relativistic` using relativistic mechanics (`E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`).\n    e.  Compute the difference.\n\n4.  **Executing the Plan (with a quick check via Python):**\n\n    *   **a. Fragment Rest Energies:**\n        *   The total rest energy of the fragments is `(m1+m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n        *   We know `m1 = 2*m2`, so `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n        *   Substitute into the sum: `2*m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n        *   `3*m2c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n        *   `m1c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n    *   **b. Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n        *   From energy conservation, the initial rest energy is converted into the final rest energy plus kinetic energy.\n        *   `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`.\n        *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n    *   **c. Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):**\n        *   From `|p1| = |p2|` and the classical formula `p = sqrt(2mT)`.\n        *   `sqrt(2*m1*T1) = sqrt(2*m2*T2)` => `m1*T1 = m2*T2`.\n        *   `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 99 / 198 = 1/2`. So, `T2 = 2*T1`.\n        *   We know `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n        *   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n        *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n    *   **d. Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic):**\n        *   Here I'll use a very elegant method that avoids solving quadratic equations.\n        *   From `|p1| = |p2|`, we also have `p1^2 = p2^2`. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`:\n            *   `E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2`.\n            *   `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2`.\n            *   `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1c^2 - m2c^2)(m1c^2 + m2c^2)`.\n        *   We know all the terms on the right, and `E1 + E2 = Mc^2 = 300 GeV` from energy conservation.\n            *   `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`.\n            *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`.\n            *   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n        *   Now I have a simple system of two linear equations:\n            1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n            2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n        *   Adding the two equations: `2*E1 = 398.01 GeV`, so `E1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n        *   The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n            *   `T1_relativistic = E1 - m1c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n            *   `T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`.\n\n    *   **e.

    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nThe nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, m1 and m2. We are given the following information:\n1.  The more massive fragment has a rest mass `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n2.  The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nFirst, let's determine the rest energies of the two fragments.\nFrom `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, we can say `(m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2`.\n` (m1 + m2)c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, it follows that `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\nWe can substitute this into the sum:\n`2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nNow, let's calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, using both classical and relativistic mechanics. The key principle is the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\n### Classical (Non-relativistic) Calculation of T1\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n`2 * m1 * T1_cl = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`\n`m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`\n`T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = (99 GeV/c^2) / (198 GeV/c^2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### Relativistic Calculation of T1\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where E is the total energy (`E = mc^2 + T`).\nRearranging for momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1^2 = p2^2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, `E1 + E2 = E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\nPlugging in the known values:\n`(E1 - E2)(300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV)(198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = (99)(297)`\n`E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations together:\n`2*E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`\n`T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### The Difference\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_cl = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe Python script confirms this result.\n\n```python\n# Constants in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\n# Calculate fragment rest energies\nm_sum_c2 = 0.99 * Mc2\nm2c2 = m_sum_c2 / 3.0\nm1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2\n# Q-value\nQ = Mc2 - m_sum_c2\n\n# Classical T1\n# From momentum conservation, T_cl is inversely proportional to mass\n# T1_cl = Q * (m2 / (m1 + m2)) = Q * (m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2))\nT1_classical = Q * (m2c2 / m_sum_c2)\n\n# Relativistic T1\n# E1 + E2 = Mc2\n# E1 - E2 = (m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / Mc2\nE1 = (Mc2 + (m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / Mc2) / 2.0\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1c2\n\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Rest energy m1: {m1c2} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest energy m2: {m2c2} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Q-value: {Q} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical * 1000} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic * 1000} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV} MeV\")\n\n```\n```text\nRest energy m1: 198.0 GeV\nRest energy m2: 99.0 GeV\nQ-value: 3.000000000000057 GeV\nClassical T1: 1000.0 MeV\nRelativistic T1: 1005.0 MeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
