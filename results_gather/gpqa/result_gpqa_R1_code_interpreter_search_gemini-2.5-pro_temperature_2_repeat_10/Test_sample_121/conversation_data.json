    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The HVZ reaction causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group (CH3). One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester. Here, the alcohol is ethanol.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine. Bromide ion (Br⁻) is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) followed by 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step process involving the alkylation of an active methylene compound.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom located between the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic because the resulting negative charge on the carbon (a carbanion) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion is a nucleophile. It reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a double alkylation sequence.\n        a. **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n           [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n        b. **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** Since *excess* NaH is used, another acidic proton (the remaining one on the alpha-carbon) is removed by NaH. This forms a new carbanion within the same molecule.\n           NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n           This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This forms a six-membered ring. This type of reaction is known as a Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\n\n        CN\n        |\n      (C1)\n     / | \\\n H2C_  |  _CH2  (C2 and C6)\n |   COOCH2CH3  |\n H2C_      _CH2  (C3 and C5)\n   \\______/\n        CH2      (C4)\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. This depends on the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, rapid conformational changes (like chair-chair interconversion of the cyclohexane ring) and rapid bond rotation lead to a time-averaged structure that determines the observed NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Ring:** The rotation about the single bond between the ring (C1) and the ester group (-COOEt) is fast on the NMR timescale. This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and effectively bisects the ester group. This plane makes pairs of carbons on the ring equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   C4 is unique.\n\n2.  **Counting the Ring Proton Signals:** In a substituted cyclohexane, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** There are four protons in total. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6. The equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two equivalent axial protons, one for the two equivalent equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because of the substitution at C1. They are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total ring signals = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 distinct signals.**\n\n3.  **Counting the Ethyl Group Proton Signals:** The ethyl group is -O-CH2-CH3.\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to fast rotation about the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2- protons:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous) and give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Total ethyl group signals = 1 + 1 = 2 distinct signals.**\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)\n    *   Total Signals = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
