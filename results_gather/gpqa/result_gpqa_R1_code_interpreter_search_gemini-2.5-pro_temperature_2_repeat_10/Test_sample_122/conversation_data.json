    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to identify the key pieces of information and what the question is asking.\n    *   **Frame of Reference 1 (S):** The Galaxy. This will be treated as the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   **Frame of Reference 2 (S'):** The supernova ejecta. This is the \"moving\" frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v):** The problem states that from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at `v = 60,000 km/s`. By the principle of relativity, an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) would see the ejecta moving towards them at the same speed `v`.\n    *   **Time in Moving Frame (Δt'):** A time of `50 seconds` passes in the ejecta's frame. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta. So, `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   **Goal:** The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S)*. Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Principles:** The problem involves speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 km/s` is 20% the speed of light). This indicates that the principles of Special Relativity must be used, not classical Newtonian mechanics. The key concept here is **time dilation**.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   To find the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame (S), I need the velocity `v` in that frame and the time elapsed `Δt` in that same frame. The formula is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   I know `v` (`60,000 km/s`).\n    *   I don't know `Δt` (the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame). I only know `Δt'` (the time in the ejecta's frame).\n    *   I must use the time dilation formula to relate `Δt` and `Δt'`. The formula is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the relative velocity `v`. The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   So, the full plan is:\n        a. Calculate the ratio `v/c`.\n        b. Use `v/c` to calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n        c. Use `γ` and `Δt'` to calculate the dilated time `Δt`.\n        d. Use `v` and `Δt` to calculate the final distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan (Calculation):**\n\n    *   **Step a: Calculate v/c**\n        *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n        *   The standard value for the speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step b: Calculate the Lorentz factor γ**\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step c: Calculate the dilated time Δt**\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step d: Calculate the distance d**\n        *   `d = v * Δt`\n        *   `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:** To get a numerical answer, I need to calculate `sqrt(0.96)`. I can use a calculator or a simple python script for accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# The distance calculated without considering time dilation would be:\n# d_classical = v * dt_prime = 3,000,000 km.\n# The options are centered around this, so we expect a relativistic correction.\n\n# Full calculation for the distance d in the Galaxy frame.\n# d = v * dt, where dt is the time in the Galaxy frame.\n# dt = gamma * dt_prime\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# So, d = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)) * dt_prime\n\n# We can group terms as: d = (v * dt_prime) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\nd_classical = v * dt_prime\nv_c_ratio_sq = (v / c)**2\ngamma_denominator = math.sqrt(1 - v_c_ratio_sq)\n\ndistance_relativistic = d_classical / gamma_denominator\n\nprint(f\"{distance_relativistic:.0f}\")\n```\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The python code execution gives the output `3061862`.\n    *   This means the calculated distance is `d = 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Now, I compare this result with the given multiple-choice options:\n        A) 3,000,000 km\n        B) 3,060,000 km\n        C) 2,880,000 km\n        D) 2,940,000 km\n    *   My calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option B, 3,060,000 km. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's intended answer. The result clearly points to B as the correct choice. Option A is the non-relativistic answer. Option C and D would imply a different relativistic effect (like length contraction applied incorrectly). Time dilation correctly predicts that more time passes in the Galaxy's frame, so the ejecta travels a longer distance than it would in 50 seconds classically.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formulation:** I will select option B based on the calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem that involves the principles of Special Relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial reference frames: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the supernova ejecta's frame (let's call it S').\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   A time interval of `Δt' = 50 s` passes in the ejecta's frame (S'). This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest in that frame.\n    *   The question asks for the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n2.  **Apply the Relevant Physics Principle (Time Dilation):**\n    *   To find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (S), we need to know the time that has passed in this frame (`Δt`). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   According to the theory of Special Relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). Conversely, to the stationary observer, more time passes in their own frame than in the moving one. This effect is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula relating the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) to the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt'`) is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n    *   **Step 1: Define constants.**\n        *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n        *   `Δt' = 50 s`\n        *   Speed of light `c = 300,000 km/s`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, squared:\n            `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n        *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n            `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n        *   `d = v * Δt`\n        *   `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96)`\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   Using the python code interpreter for precision, we found `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`.\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without relativistic effects)\n    B) 3,060,000 km\n    C) 2,880,000 km\n    D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
