    "The user wants to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2.\n\n**1. Identify Key Information and Principles:**\n*   The system has five exoplanets orbiting the same star.\n*   Orbital periods (P) are given in a ratio: `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`.\n*   The albedo (A) is the same for all planets.\n*   The orbits are circular, so the orbital distance is the semi-major axis (a).\n*   We need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, `T_eq4 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Relationship for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem states that the albedo `A` is also the same for all planets. Therefore, when we take a ratio of equilibrium temperatures, these terms will cancel out. The relationship simplifies to a proportionality:\n`T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\n**3. Set up the Temperature Ratio:**\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 4 and Planet 2 as:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = a_4^(-1/2) / a_2^(-1/2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)`\n\n**4. Use Kepler's Third Law:**\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n`P^2 ∝ a^3`\n\nWe can write this as a ratio for Planet 4 and Planet 2:\n`(P_4 / P_2)^2 = (a_4 / a_2)^3`\n\n**5. Relate the Semi-Major Axis Ratio to the Period Ratio:**\nWe need to find `a_2 / a_4` to use in our temperature ratio formula. We can rearrange the Kepler's Law equation:\n`a_4 / a_2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(2/3)`\n\nTo get the ratio `a_2 / a_4`, we invert both sides:\n`a_2 / a_4 = (a_4 / a_2)^(-1) = [ (P_4 / P_2)^(2/3) ]^(-1) = (P_4 / P_2)^(-2/3) = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n**6. Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Formula:**\nNow we substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_4` back into our temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n\nUsing the exponent rule `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Value:**\nFrom the given period ratios, we have `P_2 = 2` and `P_4 = 3.5`.\n`P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\nNow, we calculate the final ratio:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nTo get a precise value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Orbital period ratios for Planet 2 and Planet 4\nP2_ratio = 2.0\nP4_ratio = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods P2/P4\nperiod_ratio = P2_ratio / P4_ratio\n\n# The equilibrium temperature ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3.0)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.8298751336423402\n```\nThe result is approximately 0.83. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 to Planet 2 (`T_eq4` / `T_eq2`).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The simplified relationship for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\n    `T_eq ∝ (1 / a)^(1/2)`\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (its average distance from the star). This proportionality holds because all planets orbit the same star (same luminosity) and have the same albedo (as stated in the problem).\n\n3.  **Set up the Temperature Ratio:** Based on the proportionality above, we can write the ratio of the temperatures for Planet 4 and Planet 2 as:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a_4)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)] = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)`\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    We can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n    `(P_4 / P_2)² = (a_4 / a_2)³`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** We need the `(a_2 / a_4)` term for our temperature equation. Let's first rearrange Kepler's Law to solve for `(a_4 / a_2)`:\n    `a_4 / a_2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(2/3)`\n    Now, to get `(a_2 / a_4)`, we simply invert the expression:\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now we can substitute this result back into our temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n    Using the exponent rule `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`, we can simplify the exponent:\n    `(2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3`\n    This gives us the final, elegant relationship:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** From the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. Therefore, we use the ratio values `P_2 = 2` and `P_4 = 3.5`.\n    `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`\n    Plugging this into our equation:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    To compute the final value, we can use a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4\nperiod_ratio_p2_over_p4 = 2.0 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_p2_over_p4 ** (1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.8298751336423402\n```\nThe result is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
