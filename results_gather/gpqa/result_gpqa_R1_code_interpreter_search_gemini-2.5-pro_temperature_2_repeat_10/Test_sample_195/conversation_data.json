    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the harmonic oscillator system is conserved. The total energy is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. However, in a relativistic context, we must be careful. We can state that the change in potential energy is equal to the change in kinetic energy.\n    *   At the point of maximum displacement (amplitude), $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v=0$. The potential energy is at its maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero.\n        *   Potential Energy, $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   Relativistic Kinetic Energy, $K(v=0) = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}}} - 1)mc^2 = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   Potential Energy, $U_{min} = 0$.\n        *   Relativistic Kinetic Energy, $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n2.  **Set up the energy conservation equation.**\n    By the principle of conservation of energy, the maximum potential energy is converted entirely into kinetic energy when the mass passes through the equilibrium point.\n    $U_{max} = K_{max}$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Alternatively, one can consider the total relativistic energy $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$, which is conserved.\n    At $x=A$, $v=0$, so $\\gamma=1$. Total energy is $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    At $x=0$, $v=v_{max}$. Total energy is $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0$.\n    Equating these gives:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n    Rearranging gives the same equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 - mc^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n3.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    From the energy equation, we can isolate $\\gamma_{max}$.\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n4.  **Solve for $v_{max}$ using the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    The Lorentz factor $\\gamma_{max}$ is defined as:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    We can solve this for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n5.  **Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ into the equation for $v_{max}$.**\n    Now, we substitute the result from step 3 into the equation from step 4.\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option (C).\n\nThe classical result can be recovered in the limit where the potential energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy ($kA^2 \\ll mc^2$). In this limit, our expression correctly reduces to the classical result $v_{max} = \\sqrt{kA^2/m}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
