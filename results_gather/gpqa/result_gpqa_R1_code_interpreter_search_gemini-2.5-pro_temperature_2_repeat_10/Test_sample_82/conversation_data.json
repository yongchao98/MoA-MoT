    "Step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.0010 mol\n*   The initial 20.00 cm³ of acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Final Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Final Volume\n    *   Concentration = 0.0010 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   Moles of CH3COOH remaining = 75% of initial moles = 0.75 × 0.0010 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COO⁻ formed = 25% of initial moles = 0.25 × 0.0010 mol = 0.00025 mol\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base] / [acid])\n\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   Since the acid and conjugate base are in the same volume, the ratio of their concentrations is the same as the ratio of their moles.\n    *   pH = pKa + log(moles of CH3COO⁻ / moles of CH3COOH)\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n\n*   First, determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.0010 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Next, calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) in the solution:\n    *   [CH3COO⁻] = Moles of CH3COO⁻ formed / Total Volume\n    *   [CH3COO⁻] = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing a basic solution:\n    *   CH3COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH3COOH] at equilibrium.\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.020 - x) ≈ 0.020.\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.020\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the initial state and the dilution process.**\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.0200 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   First, we need to calculate the initial number of moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.0010 mol.\n*   This solution is then diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The new total volume of the acetic acid solution is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution, which will be titrated, is:\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The remaining 75% is still acetic acid.\n*   This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of a buffer:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, let's calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   In the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the ratio of concentrations ([conjugate base]/[acid]) is equal to the ratio of their moles, since they are in the same volume.\n    *   Ratio = (moles of CH₃COO⁻) / (moles of CH₃COOH) = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, we can calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Moles NaOH = Moles CH₃COOH = 0.0010 mol.\n*   The only species affecting the pH is the product of the neutralization, the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base. The solution is now essentially a 0.0010 mole solution of sodium acetate.\n*   First, we need to find the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point. We need to calculate how much 0.1 M NaOH was added.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate. We can find it using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We can set up an equilibrium expression to find the concentration of OH⁻. Let [OH⁻] = x.\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.020, so (0.020 - x) ≈ 0.020.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.020\n    *   x² = 0.020 * (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nThese calculated values correspond to option B.
