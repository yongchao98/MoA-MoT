    "*   **Analysis of the Symmetries in SMEFT:**\n\n    The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. It is constructed based on a set of fundamental principles. We need to determine which of the listed symmetries are assumed to be conserved by construction for *all* operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian.\n\n    1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is a quantum field theory (QFT) formulated within the framework of special relativity. Lorentz invariance, which states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames, is a cornerstone of any QFT describing particle physics as we know it. All operators in the SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars to ensure the Lagrangian and the resulting physics are independent of the observer's orientation or velocity. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n    2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** Poincaré symmetry is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. It includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) as well as spacetime translations. Invariance under spacetime translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry is a foundational assumption in the construction of QFTs, including SMEFT. All operators are constructed to respect this symmetry.\n\n    3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity inversion (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably through the weak interaction and the complex phase in the CKM matrix. SMEFT is designed to be a general framework that parameterizes potential new physics, including new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, SMEFT explicitly includes operators that violate CP symmetry. The coefficients of these operators are then constrained by experiments (like searches for electric dipole moments). Since not all operators respect it, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n    4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in local, Lorentz-invariant QFTs. It states that any such theory is automatically symmetric under the combined action of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must, by the CPT theorem, respect CPT symmetry. All operators in the theory are built to be CPT-invariant. A violation of CPT would imply a much more profound breakdown of the fundamental principles of QFT (like locality or Lorentz invariance) than SMEFT is designed to describe.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n\n    Therefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
