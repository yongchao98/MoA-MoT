    "Here's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: nitro group (-NO2)\n*   Relative positions:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: An alkyl group. It's an *ortho, para* director and an activating group. It's very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the *ortho* position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: An alkoxy group. It's a strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A strong *meta* director and a strong deactivating group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group. It's formed by reducing -NO2. It can be protonated in strong acid to form -NH3+, which becomes a *meta* director. It can also be converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is a versatile intermediate.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group. It can be converted to an -OEt group via Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: A *meta* director and a deactivating group. It's often used as a reversible \"blocking group\" because it can be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it leads to the correct product isomer.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts)\nii) + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**. Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the *para* product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. The *para* position is now blocked.\niii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group.\n*   **Isomer Check:** At this stage, the intermediate has the t-butyl group and the nitro group *meta* to each other. The final product requires them to be *ortho*. Since the relative positions of these two groups are already wrong, this entire sequence cannot lead to the desired product. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\nii) + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**.\niii) + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **This reaction fails**. Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on strongly activated rings like aniline because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\nii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene** (+ the major *para* isomer). We must assume we can isolate the minor *ortho* product to proceed.\niii) + SO3/H2SO4 → Sulfonation of 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p) and -NO2 (m) direct to the same positions (C4 and C6). The product would be something like **4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\niv) + NaNO2/HCl → **This reaction fails**. The reagent NaNO2/HCl is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The molecule at step iii has no amino group. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\nii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**. As with option C, this step requires the isolation of the minor *ortho* isomer. While not \"high-yield\", it's a necessary step for the required substitution pattern.\niii) + Fe/HCl → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This is a standard reaction.\niv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. This is the crucial step. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n    *   Starting with 2-(tert-butyl)aniline (NH2 at C1, tBu at C2). The anilinium ion has -NH3+ at C1, -tBu at C2.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs an incoming electrophile to positions C3 and C5.\n    *   The -tBu group directs to positions C3 (ortho) and C5 (para).\n    *   Both groups direct substitution to C3 and C5. The reaction yields a mixture of **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline** and **5-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. We need the 3-nitro isomer. Although it may not be the major product, its formation is chemically sound.\nv) + NaNO2/HCl → The amino group of **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline** is converted to a diazonium salt: **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)benzenediazonium salt**.\nvi) + H3O+, H2O/Heat → The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)phenol**.\nvii) + NaOH/EtBr → The phenol is converted to an ether (Williamson ether synthesis), yielding **1-ethoxy-2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene**. This matches the name and structure of the target molecule.\n*   **Conclusion on steps i-vii:** This sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct isomer. The \"high-yield\" claim in the question may be an exaggeration due to the isomeric mixtures formed in steps ii and iv, but the pathway is fundamentally correct.\n*   **Steps viii and ix:** The presence of `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4` at the end of the sequence is illogical, as they would sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the final product for no reason. These are likely included erroneously in the option. However, among the given choices, Option D is the only one that provides a chemically viable route to the correct product isomer.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions A, B, and C contain fatal chemical flaws (wrong isomer or impossible reactions). Option D describes a sequence that, despite potential yield issues and extraneous final steps, correctly navigates the regiochemical challenges to form the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Therefore, it is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
