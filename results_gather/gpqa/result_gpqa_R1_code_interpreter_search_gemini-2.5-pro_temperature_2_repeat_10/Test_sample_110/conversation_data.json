    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will generate a nucleophile from the ketone (an enolate), which will then perform a conjugate attack on the ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O at position 1).\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has a proton, the base will exclusively deprotonate at C6. This forms an enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The steric hindrance of the base (t-BuOK) is irrelevant here as there is only one possible enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting product, after protonation (workup is implied), will have a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The product structure is `2-ethyl-6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Name (Product A):**\n    *   The options provide names where the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. We need to match our derived structure to these names.\n    *   Let's analyze the name format: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This means the parent chain is ethyl propanoate, and a substituted cyclohexyl ring is attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain gets the lowest possible locant, which is C1'.\n    *   So, C6 of our original ketone is now C1' of the cyclohexyl substituent. Let's trace the numbering around the ring:\n        *   **C1'**: This is the attachment point (old C6). It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **C2'**: This was the original C1 of the ketone. It has an **oxo** (=O) group.\n        *   **C3'**: This was the original C2. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these substituent names on the cyclohexyl ring, we get: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for Product A in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-protons acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base.\n    *   **Solvent/Workup:** H₂O.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group).\n    *   The resulting nucleophile is the nitronate anion: `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   For `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   After protonation by H₂O, the product structure is: `CH₃-CH(X)-CH₂-CN`, where `X` is the added group, `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The full structure is `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Name (Product B):**\n    *   We need to name this structure according to IUPAC rules. The nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority than the nitro group (-NO₂), so the parent chain is a nitrile.\n    *   We must find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   The structure can be written as: `Et-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Let's number the longest chain:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   This gives a 6-carbon parent chain, so the base name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we identify the substituents on this chain:\n        *   At C3, there is a **methyl** group.\n        *   At C4, there is a **nitro** group.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for Product B in options **B** and **D**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. (Matches C and D)\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. (Matches B and D)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
