    "This problem requires finding the eigenvector of a spin-1/2 operator along a specific direction in space. Let's break down the problem into logical steps.\n\n### Step 1: Define the operators and the direction vector\n\nThe problem provides the components of the spin operator $\\vec{P}$ in the x, y, and z directions. These are proportional to the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThe operator we are interested in is the projection of $\\vec{P}$ onto an arbitrary direction vector $\\vec{n}$ that lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n### Step 2: Construct the operator for spin along $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the operator matrices:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\sin\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\nCombine the matrices:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### Step 3: Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$b = a \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing trigonometric half-angle identities, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$b = a \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose a convenient form for the constant $a$ to simplify the expression. Let $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$, where $C$ is a normalization constant.\nThen $b = C \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nThe eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its inner product with itself is 1.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$\nThe ket is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$, and the corresponding bra is $\\langle\\psi| = C^* \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = |C|^2 (1) = 1$\nThis implies $|C|^2 = 1$. We can choose the simplest case where $C=1$ (the overall phase of an eigenvector is arbitrary).\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are unitless state vectors and do not contain $\\hbar$.\nB) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect for the same reason.\nC) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Correct. This matches our derived result.\nD) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The functional form is different ($\\theta$ vs $\\theta/2$)."
