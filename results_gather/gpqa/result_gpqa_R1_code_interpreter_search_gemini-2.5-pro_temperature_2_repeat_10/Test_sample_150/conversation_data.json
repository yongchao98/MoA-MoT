    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving the calculation of a measurement probability.\n\n### **1. Understand the Theory**\n\nThe probability `P(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `O` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n\n`P(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ ⋅ ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector of the observable `O` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product (or dot product) of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` are the squared norms (lengths) of the respective vectors.\n\nIf the state vector and eigenvector are normalized, the formula simplifies to `P(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|²`. We will use the general formula to avoid potential errors in normalization.\n\n### **2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   **State vector (`|ψ⟩`)**: A column matrix with elements `(-1, 2, 1)`.\n*   **Observable operator (`P`)**: The matrix\n    ```\n    [ 0,  1/√2,  0   ]\n    [ 1/√2, 0,  1/√2 ]\n    [ 0,  1/√2,  0   ]\n    ```\n*   **Target eigenvalue (`λ`)**: We are asked to find the probability of measuring the value `0`. So, `λ = 0`.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n#### **Step 1: Find the eigenvector `|v_0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`**\n\nThe eigenvector `|v_0⟩` is a vector that satisfies the equation `P|v_0⟩ = λ|v_0⟩`.\nSince `λ = 0`, the equation becomes `P|v_0⟩ = 0`. Let `|v_0⟩` be a column vector with elements `(x, y, z)`.\n\n```\n[ 0,  1/√2,  0   ] [ x ]   [ 0 ]\n[ 1/√2, 0,  1/√2 ] [ y ] = [ 0 ]\n[ 0,  1/√2,  0   ] [ z ]   [ 0 ]\n```\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nWe can choose any non-zero value for `z`. Let's choose `z = -1`. Then `x = 1` and `y = 0`.\nSo, an eigenvector corresponding to `λ=0` is `|v_0⟩` with elements `(1, 0, -1)`.\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the required terms for the probability formula**\n\nWe have:\n*   `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`\n*   `|v_0⟩ = (1, 0, -1)`\n\nNow, we compute the necessary components:\n*   **Inner product `⟨v_0|ψ⟩`**:\n    This is the dot product of `|v_0⟩` and `|ψ⟩`.\n    `⟨v_0|ψ⟩ = (1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n\n*   **Squared norm of the eigenvector `⟨v_0|v_0⟩`**:\n    `⟨v_0|v_0⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculate the probability**\n\nNow we plug these values into the probability formula:\n\n`P(0) = |⟨v_0|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_0|v_0⟩ ⋅ ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n`P(0) = |-2|² / (2 * 6)`\n`P(0) = 4 / 12`\n`P(0) = 1/3`\n\nTo confirm this result, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the operator P and the state vector psi\nP = np.array([\n    [0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2), 0, 1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0]\n])\n\npsi = np.array([-1, 2, 1])\n\n# Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(P)\n\n# Find the index of the eigenvalue 0\n# Use a tolerance due to floating-point arithmetic\ntarget_eigenvalue = 0\ntry:\n    index_of_0 = np.where(np.isclose(eigenvalues, target_eigenvalue))[0][0]\nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Eigenvalue 0 not found.\")\n    exit()\n\n# Get the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0\nv_0 = eigenvectors[:, index_of_0]\n\n# Calculate the inner product <v_0|psi>\n# Note: v_0.conj() is the conjugate, which for a real vector is the vector itself\ninner_product = np.dot(v_0.conj(), psi)\n\n# The state vector psi needs to be normalized for the standard probability formula\n# The squared norm is <psi|psi>\npsi_norm_sq = np.dot(psi.conj(), psi)\n\n# Probability is |<v_0|psi>|^2 / <psi|psi>\n# <v_0|v_0> is 1 because np.linalg.eig returns normalized eigenvectors.\nprob = np.abs(inner_product)**2 / psi_norm_sq\n\nprint(prob)\n```\n0.33333333333333337\n\nThe computed probability is `1/3`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "In quantum mechanics, the probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `O` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨vλ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨vλ|vλ⟩ ⋅ ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|vλ⟩` is the eigenvector of the observable `O` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨vλ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` and `⟨vλ|vλ⟩` are the squared norms of the vectors.\n\n**Given:**\n*   State vector `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n*   Observable `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The eigenvalue to be measured is `λ = 0`.\n\n**Step 1: Find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`**\nWe need to solve the eigenvector equation `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩`, which becomes `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0`.
