    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the initial assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. `ρ` = (Number of stars) / (Unit Volume).\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a spherical shell:** Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is between a distance `d` from the observer and a slightly larger distance `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd^2`.\n    *   Thickness of the shell is `dd`.\n    *   So, the volume of the shell is `dV = 4πd^2 dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 dd`.\n\n3.  **Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `plx = 1/d` (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs). From this, we can express the distance `d` in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Relate the differential elements (dd and d(plx)):** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of *parallax*, which is `dN/d(plx)`. Our current expression for `dN` involves `dd`. We need to convert `dd` into terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relationship `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`.\n    *   Therefore, `dd = - (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign for this part of the derivation. Thus, we use `dd = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute to get the distribution in terms of parallax:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   Original equation: `dN = ρ * 4πd^2 dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π(1/plx)^2 dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`: `dN = ρ * 4π(1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression: `dN = (4πρ / plx^4) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This is exactly the term `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can see that: `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx^4`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The term `4πρ` is a constant because we assumed a uniform star density `ρ`. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\nThis means that there are vastly more stars with very small parallaxes (which are very far away) per parallax interval than there are stars with large parallaxes (which are very close).\n\n<<<D>>>"
