As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "*   **Analysis of Single Mutants:**\n    *   The wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance.\n    *   The `g2` mutant shows 0% resistance. The complete loss of the resistance phenotype when a single gene is knocked out suggests that this gene, G2, is absolutely essential for the pathway.\n    *   The `g1` mutant shows 75% resistance (a 25% loss), and the `g3` mutant shows 50% resistance (a 50% loss). This means G1 and G3 both contribute to resistance, but they are not individually essential.\n\n*   **Analysis of Double Mutants and Gene Interactions:**\n    *   **Epistasis of G2:**\n        *   The `g1g2` double mutant has 0% resistance, which is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant.\n        *   The `g2g3` double mutant also has 0% resistance, again the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant.\n        *   When a double mutant exhibits the phenotype of one of the single mutants, it's called epistasis. Here, the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` and `g3` mutations. This strongly indicates that G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway. Given the problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the prime candidate for this role. So, a plausible pathway is G2 activating both G1 and G3.\n\n    *   **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n        *   Let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant. Its resistance is 10%.\n        *   If the effects were simply additive, we would expect a combined loss of resistance: loss from g1 (25%) + loss from g3 (50%) = 75% total loss. This would result in 100% - 75% = 25% resistance.\n        *   However, the observed resistance is only 10%, which corresponds to a 90% loss of function. This effect is much greater than the sum of the individual effects (90% > 75%). This type of genetic interaction is called **synergism** or **synthetic enhancement**.\n        *   Synergism often occurs when two genes have partially overlapping or parallel functions, which is a form of **gene redundancy**. When one gene is lost, the other can partially compensate. When both are lost, the system fails more dramatically than predicted. Therefore, G1 and G3 likely function in redundant or parallel pathways downstream of G2.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). Pleiotropy (a gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be concluded from this experiment, as only one trait (resistance) was measured.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** The claim that G3 is epistatic towards G1 is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). While they might be co-regulated (e.g., sharing promoter elements), this cannot be definitively concluded from this data alone.\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. G2, not G1, is the upstream gene, as G2 is epistatic to G1 (the `g1g2` mutant phenocopies the `g2` mutant, not the `g1` mutant).\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is a strong conclusion from our analysis.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is also a strong conclusion, explaining the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` mutant.\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is, by the standard definition, incorrect. However, compared to the other options, this choice correctly identifies the two most important relationships: G2's role as an upstream regulator and the redundant nature of G1 and G3. The incorrect statement about epistasis is likely a flaw in the question's option, but the other two parts make this the best overall conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
