    "E_initial = E_p + E_p_bar\nSince the antiproton is slowly moving, we can assume the initial kinetic energies are negligible. So the initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton.\nE_initial = m_p*c^2 + m_p_bar*c^2\nThe mass of an antiproton is the same as the mass of a proton.\nm_p*c^2 = 938.27 MeV\nSo, E_initial = 2 * 938.27 MeV = 1876.54 MeV\n\nE_final = E_2A+ + E_2A-\nThe final state has four particles of mass m_A. By conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum is close to zero, the final particles must fly off in directions such that the total momentum is zero. By symmetry, they will all have the same kinetic energy and thus the same total energy.\nLet E_A be the total energy of one particle A.\nE_A = K + m_A*c^2, where K is the kinetic energy.\nThe total final energy is:\nE_final = 4 * E_A = 4 * (gamma * m_A*c^2)\nWe are given m_A*c^2 = 300 MeV.\nE_final = 4 * gamma * 300 MeV = 1200 * gamma MeV\n\nBy conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\n1876.54 MeV = 1200 * gamma MeV\ngamma = 1876.54 / 1200\ngamma = 1.56378\n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma is defined as:\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\ngamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / gamma^2\nv^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / gamma^2\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 1 / gamma^2)\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 1 / 1.56378^2)\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 1 / 2.4454)\nv/c = sqrt(1 - 0.4089)\nv/c = sqrt(0.5911)\nv/c = 0.7688\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
