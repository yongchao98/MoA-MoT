    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Star's Brightness:** The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing either its fully bright hemisphere or its partially spotted hemisphere. The maximum brightness (and thus maximum flux, `F_max`) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The minimum brightness (`F_min`) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\n2.  **Apply the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The flux (energy radiated per unit area per unit time) of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (F ∝ T⁴). We will use this relationship to compare the flux from the hot photosphere and the cooler spots.\n\n    *   Temperature of the star's photosphere, `T_star` = 6000 K.\n    *   Temperature of the dark spots, `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Flux from Each Hemisphere:**\n    *   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** When the unspotted hemisphere faces us, the entire visible surface has a temperature `T_star`. The flux is proportional to `T_star⁴`.\n        `F_max` ∝ `T_star⁴`\n\n    *   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** When the spotted hemisphere faces us, 20% of its area is covered by cooler spots (`f = 0.20`), and the remaining 80% (`1-f`) is at the normal photosphere temperature. The total flux is the weighted average of the flux from these two components.\n        `F_min` ∝ (1 - f) * `T_star⁴` + f * `T_spot⁴`\n\n4.  **Determine the Amplitude of the Light Curve Variation:** The amplitude of the variation is the fractional drop in brightness from maximum to minimum.\n    Amplitude = (`F_max` - `F_min`) / `F_max`\n    Amplitude = [`T_star⁴` - ((1 - f) * `T_star⁴` + f * `T_spot⁴`)] / `T_star⁴`\n    Simplifying the numerator:\n    `T_star⁴` - `T_star⁴` + f * `T_star⁴` - f * `T_spot⁴` = f * (`T_star⁴` - `T_spot⁴`)\n    So, the expression for the amplitude becomes:\n    Amplitude = f * (`T_star⁴` - `T_spot⁴`) / `T_star⁴`\n    Amplitude = f * (1 - `T_spot⁴` / `T_star⁴`)\n    Amplitude = f * (1 - (`T_spot` / `T_star`)⁴)\n\n5.  **Relate Spot Modulation to an Exoplanet Transit:** The problem asks for the size of an exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude drop in the light curve. For a transiting exoplanet, this drop in brightness (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    Transit Depth (δ) = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * `R_pl`²) / (π * `R_star`²) = (`R_pl` / `R_star`)²\n\n    We set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation:\n    (`R_pl` / `R_star`)² = Amplitude\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, we combine the equations and solve for `R_pl / R_star`.\n    (`R_pl` / `R_star`)² = f * (1 - (`T_spot` / `T_star`)⁴)\n    `R_pl / R_star` = sqrt[ f * (1 - (`T_spot` / `T_star`)⁴) ]\n\n    To get the numerical answer, a Python script is used for precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nT_star = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20       # Filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# The amplitude is equal to the transit depth (delta) of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# delta = (R_planet / R_star)**2\n# So, R_planet / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.321808039649557\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.3218, which is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl`) relative to its star's radius (`R_star`) that would cause the same drop in brightness as the rotational modulation from a star with a spotted hemisphere.\n\n2.  **Model the Star's Flux Variation:** The brightness of the star changes as it rotates. We need to define the maximum and minimum brightness (or flux).\n    *   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The observed flux is proportional to the radiating power of this surface. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, flux is proportional to the fourth power of temperature (T⁴). So, `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the hemisphere with dark spots faces the observer. This hemisphere is not uniform. 20% of its area (`f` = 0.20) is covered by cooler spots (`T_spot`), and the remaining 80% (`1-f`) is at the normal stellar temperature (`T_star`). The total flux is a weighted average of the flux from these two components: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Light Curve:** The amplitude of the variation is the fractional drop in brightness.\n    *   Amplitude = (`F_max` - `F_min`) / `F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        Amplitude = (`T_star⁴` - [(`1 - f`) * `T_star⁴` + `f` * `T_spot⁴`]) / `T_star⁴`\n    *   Simplifying the numerator:\n        Numerator = `T_star⁴` - `T_star⁴` + `f * T_star⁴` - `f * T_spot⁴` = `f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n    *   So, the full expression becomes:\n        Amplitude = `f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n        Amplitude = `f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_star⁴)`\n        Amplitude = `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\n4.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:** When a planet transits (passes in front of) its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The resulting dip in brightness, known as the transit depth (`δ`), is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    *   `δ` = Area_planet / Area_star = (`π * R_pl²`) / (`π * R_star²`) = (`R_pl / R_star`)²\n\n5.  **Equate the Effects and Solve:** The problem states that the exoplanet must produce the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the spot modulation amplitude.\n    *   (`R_pl / R_star`)² = `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star` = `sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴) ]`\n\n6.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   `f` = 0.20\n    *   `T_star` = 6000 K\n    *   `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   `R_pl / R_star` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) ]`\n\n    The calculation was performed in the previous turn and resulted in `0.32179...`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value `R_pl / R_star` ≈ 0.3218. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
