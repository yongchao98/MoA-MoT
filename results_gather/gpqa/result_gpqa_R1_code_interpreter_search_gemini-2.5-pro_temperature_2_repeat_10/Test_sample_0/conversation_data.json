    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known. For energy (E) and time (t), the relation is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state. This is often referred to as the \"natural linewidth\".\n*   Δt is the time interval over which the energy is measured. For an unstable state, this can be taken as its lifetime (τ).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\nSo, for a state with a finite lifetime τ, its energy is not perfectly defined. There is an intrinsic spread or uncertainty in its energy given by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Define the \"Clearly Resolved\" Condition**\n\nFor two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly resolved or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). A simpler and common criterion is that the energy difference must be at least larger than the broader of the two linewidths.\n\nLet's calculate the linewidths for both states.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Linewidths**\n\nWe will need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) for convenience, since the answer options are in eV.\n\n*   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo perform the calculation without potential rounding errors, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV.s\nhbar_evs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using Delta_E = hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_evs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_evs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"The energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1) is approximately: {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2) is approximately: {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The broader linewidth is the larger of the two\nbroader_linewidth = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"The broader linewidth, which determines the resolvability, is: {broader_linewidth:.3e} eV\")\n\n```\n\nExecution Output:\n```text\nThe energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1) is approximately: 6.582e-07 eV\nThe energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2) is approximately: 6.582e-08 eV\nThe broader linewidth, which determines the resolvability, is: 6.582e-07 eV\n```\n\n**4. Compare and Conclude**\n\nFrom the calculation, the energy linewidths are:\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe broader of the two linewidths is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference |E1 - E2| must be significantly larger than this value.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than ΔE₁, so the energy distributions would heavily overlap. They cannot be resolved.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than the broader linewidth (10⁻⁴ >> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷). This separation is sufficient for the levels to be clearly resolved.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than both linewidths. They cannot be resolved.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is also much smaller and cannot be resolved.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user is asking for a resolution to a physics problem regarding quantum states, energy levels, and their lifetimes, which falls under the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Recall the Relevant Physics Principle**\n\nThe relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt) and the uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE) is given by the energy-time uncertainty principle:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFor practical purposes, this is often approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the energy width or natural linewidth of the state.\n*   τ (tau) is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**\n\nWe need to calculate the energy spread (ΔE) for each state, as this determines how \"blurry\" the energy level is.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Resolution**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their central energies must be larger than their energy spreads. A common criterion (the Rayleigh criterion for spectroscopy) is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the spectral lines, which corresponds to the energy uncertainties we calculated. More strictly, the separation should be greater than the broader of the two linewidths.\n\nThe broader linewidth is the larger one:\nmax(ΔE₁, ΔE₂) = max(6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV, 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, to clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than approximately 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's compare the required energy difference with the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the broader linewidth of 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The energy levels would overlap too much to be resolved.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is significantly larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This separation is large enough to clearly resolve the two levels.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the linewidths. The levels cannot be resolved.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is extremely small compared to the linewidths and cannot be resolved.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only energy difference that is sufficiently large to allow the two energy levels to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
