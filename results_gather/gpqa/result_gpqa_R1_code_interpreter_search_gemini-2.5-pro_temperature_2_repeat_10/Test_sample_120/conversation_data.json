    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   **Parent Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a three-membered epoxide ring. The epoxide connects carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are located at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The specific arrangement of these groups in 3D space is defined by the R/S descriptors: C1 is (R), C3 is (R), C4 is (R), and C6 is (S). The fusion of the epoxide to the cyclohexane ring must be *cis*. To satisfy the given stereochemistry, the epoxide oxygen must be on the top face (beta, β), forcing the cyclohexane into a half-chair conformation. This leads to the following dispositions for the substituents:\n        *   C1-Methyl: alpha (α, pointing down)\n        *   C3-Methyl: beta (β, pointing up)\n        *   C4-Methyl: alpha (α, pointing down)\n        *   The hydrogen at C6 is alpha (α, pointing down).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The problem statement specifies that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n        *   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6.\n        *   C1 is a *quaternary* carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n        *   C6 is a *tertiary* carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n        *   Generally, a tertiary carbon is sterically less hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an SN2 reaction.\n        *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) will attack the C6 carbon from the side opposite to the C6-O bond.\n        *   Since the epoxide oxygen is on the top face (beta), the C6-O bond points up. The attack will occur from the bottom face (alpha).\n        *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after a workup step (e.g., addition of water or mild acid), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The methyl group from Me₂CuLi attacks C6. The C1-O bond remains, and the oxygen is protonated to form an alcohol.\n    *   **Numbering the Product:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group receives the lowest possible locant, which is C1. Therefore, the original C1 of the starting material becomes **new C1** in the product.\n    *   The ring is numbered starting from this new C1. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number towards the most substituted adjacent carbon. The original C6, which now has a new methyl group, becomes **new C2**. The rest of the ring is numbered accordingly: original C5 becomes new C3, original C4 becomes new C4, original C3 becomes new C5, and original C2 becomes new C6.\n    *   **Identifying Substituents on the Product:**\n        *   **New C1** (from original C1): has the -OH group and the original methyl group.\n        *   **New C2** (from original C6): has the newly added methyl group.\n        *   **New C4** (from original C4): has its original methyl group.\n        *   **New C5** (from original C3): has its original methyl group.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches the chemical names given in options C and D, and rules out A and B (which would have resulted from attack at C1).\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   **Inversion at the attack site:** The attack occurs at C6, which had an (S) configuration. Due to the SN2 inversion, its configuration becomes (R). In the product, this carbon is **New C2**, so the configuration at C2 is **(R)**.\n    *   **Retention at other centers:** The configurations of the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n        *   Original C1 was (R). It becomes **New C1**, which is **(R)**.\n        *   Original C4 was (R). It becomes **New C4**, which is **(R)**.\n        *   Original C3 was (R). It becomes **New C5**, which is **(R)**.\n    *   **Final Configuration:** The predicted stereochemistry for the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The product of the reaction is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
