    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the initial compound using its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring. The C=O group of an aldehyde would account for this.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 hydrogens (a -CH2- group). This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is downfield, consistent with it being alpha to a carbonyl group and also attached to an aromatic ring (benzylic).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The relatively upfield chemical shifts suggest the ring has a strong electron-donating group attached.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield position of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Putting the fragments together: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO (acetaldehyde) group. The only way to combine these to satisfy the formula C8H9NO is to attach the -NH2 and -CH2CHO groups at the para positions (1 and 4) of the benzene ring.\n\n    Therefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, let's follow the starting material through the three reaction steps.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/G5gQy6J.png) \n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard diazotization reaction. A primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/hX0YgC5.png) \n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas. This is a Sandmeyer-type reaction to produce a phenol.\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y1gM8vD.png) \n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group), which are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** First, the base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        The product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n         ![](https://i.imgur.com/gK2R83B.png) \n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" is crucial. Heating the aldol addition product in the presence of base promotes the elimination of a molecule of water (dehydration). The acidic α-proton (on C-2) is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group (on C-3) leaves, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This creates a highly stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings.\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n         ![](https://i.imgur.com/6D9TUnO.png) \n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because the reaction is heated, the final product is the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\nMatching our derived final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure, not a dimerization product.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This perfectly matches our derived final product.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n\nThus, the final product is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
