    "The core of this problem lies in the normalization principle of a wave function in quantum mechanics. The principle states that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Probability Density:** The probability of finding a particle at a certain position `x` is given by the square of the modulus of its wave function, denoted as $|\\Psi(x)|^2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Modulus Squared:** The wave function is given as a complex number: $\\Psi(x) = (\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1+x}}) - 0.5i$.\n    The modulus squared of a complex number `z = u + vi` is $|z|^2 = u^2 + v^2$.\n    In our case, the real part is $u = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1+x}}$ and the imaginary part is $v = -0.5$.\n    Therefore, the probability density is:\n    $|\\Psi(x)|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1+x}}\\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25$.\n\n3.  **Normalization Condition:** The problem states that particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n    $\\int_{1}^{3} |\\Psi(x)|^2 dx = 1$\n\n4.  **Set up the Integral:** Substitute the expression for the probability density into the integral:\n    $\\int_{1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \\right) dx = 1$\n\n5.  **Solve the Integral:** We solve the definite integral:\n    $[a^2 \\ln(1+x) + 0.25x]_{1}^{3} = 1$\n\n6.  **Apply the Limits of Integration:** We evaluate the expression at the upper limit (x=3) and subtract its value at the lower limit (x=1):\n    $(a^2 \\ln(1+3) + 0.25 \\times 3) - (a^2 \\ln(1+1) + 0.25 \\times 1) = 1$\n    $(a^2 \\ln(4) + 0.75) - (a^2 \\ln(2) + 0.25) = 1$\n\n7.  **Solve for \"a\":** Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for `a`:\n    $a^2 \\ln(4) - a^2 \\ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1$\n    $a^2 (\\ln(4) - \\ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1$\n    Using the logarithm property $\\ln(b) - \\ln(c) = \\ln(b/c)$, we get:\n    $a^2 \\ln(4/2) = 1 - 0.5$\n    $a^2 \\ln(2) = 0.5$\n    $a^2 = \\frac{0.5}{\\ln(2)}$\n    $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5}{\\ln(2)}}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** The calculation was performed using Python, and the output provided was:\n    `a ≈ 0.84932`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 0.85\n    *   B) 1.1\n    *   C) 0.6\n    *   D) 0.35\n\nThe calculated value of `a` is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
