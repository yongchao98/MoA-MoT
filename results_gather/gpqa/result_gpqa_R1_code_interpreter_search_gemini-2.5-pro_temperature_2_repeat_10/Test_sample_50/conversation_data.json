    "This problem requires finding the potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. A powerful technique for solving such problems is the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the conducting sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere's original volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it is grounded).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n\n*   Located at a distance `d'` from the center, on the line connecting the center and `q`.\n    `d' = R^2 / d`\n*   Has a magnitude:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThe image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`, which indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the sphere is attractive.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance (where potential energy is zero) to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center. We can calculate this using two common methods.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\n\n1.  **Force on the charge q**: The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is equivalent to the electrostatic force exerted by the image charge `q'`. At this point, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a position `d'(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - d'(x)`.\n    The force `F(x)` is:\n    `F(x) = k * (q * q') / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * (q * (-qR/x)) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * (R/x) / ((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates the force is attractive (directed towards the sphere).\n\n2.  **Work and Potential Energy**: The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the field.\n    `U = W_agent = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which means `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    `∫ (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\n    Now, we evaluate the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using Potential `U = (1/2) qV`\n\n1.  **Energy Formula**: For a system of a point charge and a grounded conductor, the total potential energy is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n\n2.  **Induced Potential**: By the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q` (distance `d`).\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy**: Now substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the potential energy of the system:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect `R^2`\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect numerator and missing factor of 1/2.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct match.**\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
