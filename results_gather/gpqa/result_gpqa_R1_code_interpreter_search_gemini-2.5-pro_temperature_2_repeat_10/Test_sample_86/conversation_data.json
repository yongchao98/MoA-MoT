    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula core:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6). Therefore, the two substituents attached to the ring must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n        *   An **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a Structure:**\n    *   Based on the information above, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   The problem states it's a di-substituted ring. The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. The 1H NMR spectrum will reveal this arrangement due to molecular symmetry.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure (Haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) has three protons on its methyl group. These protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically in the range of δ 2.2-2.6 ppm due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl group. This signal should integrate to **3H**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **ortho or meta**, the four aromatic protons are all chemically non-equivalent, which would lead to a complex spectrum with four distinct signals.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4)**, the molecule has a high degree of symmetry. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are also equivalent to each other. This results in a simple pattern: two signals, each integrating to **2H**. Each signal appears as a **doublet (d)** because each proton is split by its single adjacent proton neighbor. This characteristic `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern in the δ 7-8 ppm range is a classic signature of para-substitution.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum does not show a 3H singlet for an acetyl group. It also only shows 1H in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted ring. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). An aromatic compound must show peaks in this region. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This is the classic, clean pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Alkyl region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This perfectly matches the signal for an **acetyl group's methyl protons** (a 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm).\n        *   This spectrum is an exact match for the predicted spectrum of **para-haloacetophenone**. It satisfies all conditions: C8, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl group, aromatic-halogen bond (inferred from the structure that fits the NMR), and the correct NMR signals.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at **δ 9.9 ppm** is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   This means the carbonyl group is an aldehyde.\n        *   The aromatic pattern (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) suggests para-substitution.\n        *   A plausible structure with C8, a para-substituted ring, an aldehyde, and a halogen would be **4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (Ar-CH2-X)**. This structure has 8 carbons, and its NMR would indeed show two aromatic doublets, a singlet for the aldehyde proton, and a singlet for the CH2 protons.\n        *   **However, this structure contradicts the FTIR data.** In 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, the halogen is on a benzylic carbon (C-X), not directly on the aromatic ring (Ar-X). The question explicitly states an \"aromatic-halogen bond\". Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option C is the only one that is fully consistent with all the provided information. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
