    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The approach is to determine the moles of acidic and basic species, let them neutralize each other, and then calculate the pH based on the species remaining in excess.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   HCl completely dissociates in water: HCl → H+ + Cl-\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 completely dissociates in water: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-, Moles of OH- = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**2. Perform neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong acid (H+) and strong base (OH-) will react first until one is consumed.\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- remaining from the first reaction = 0.100 mol\n\nThe CH3COOH will be completely consumed as there is more OH-.\n*   Excess moles of OH- = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains 0.050 moles of excess strong base (OH-). This excess strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH- and determine the pH.**\n\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the final solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\nNow, calculate the molar concentration of the excess OH-.\n*   [OH-] = (Excess moles of OH-) / (Total Volume)\n*   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = **0.04167 M**\n\nCalculate the pOH of the solution.\n*   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n*   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculation precisely.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Moles calculation\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1  # Weak acid\nmoles_hcl = 0.400 * 0.2     # Strong acid (provides H+)\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.300 * 0.3     # Strong base\nmoles_oh = moles_baoh2 * 2     # Strong base (provides OH-)\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization\n# Strong acid (H+) vs. Strong base (OH-)\nmoles_oh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh - moles_hcl\n# Remaining strong base (OH-) vs. Weak acid (CH3COOH)\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 3: pH calculation\n# Total volume in Liters\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n# Concentration of excess OH-\nconc_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n# pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n12.62\n\nThe calculation shows that the final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>",
