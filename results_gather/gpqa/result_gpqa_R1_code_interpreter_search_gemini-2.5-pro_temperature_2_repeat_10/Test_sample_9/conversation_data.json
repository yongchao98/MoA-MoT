    "*   **Analyze the options:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with Earth's density. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. We will use this as our reference point.\n        *   Density_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3:** The density is given directly in the question.\n        *   Density_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n        *   This is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is made of the same materials as Earth (iron, silicon, oxygen, etc.) but has five times the mass. Due to the significantly stronger gravity of this more massive planet, its constituent materials will be compressed much more tightly. Greater compression means fitting more mass into a smaller proportional volume. Density is Mass/Volume. Since the mass increases by a factor of 5 and the volume increases by a smaller factor due to compression, the overall density will be higher than Earth's.\n        *   For rocky planets of the same composition, density increases with mass.\n        *   Therefore, Density_c > Density_a (5.51 g/cm³).\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), this planet has less mass than Earth. Its gravity will be weaker, and thus its materials will be less compressed than Earth's. This results in a lower average density compared to Earth.\n        *   For rocky planets of the same composition, density decreases with less mass.\n        *   Therefore, Density_d < Density_a (5.51 g/cm³).\n\n*   **Compare the densities:**\n\n    *   Density_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density_c > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The planet described in option (c) will be the densest because its greater mass leads to greater gravitational compression of its materials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
