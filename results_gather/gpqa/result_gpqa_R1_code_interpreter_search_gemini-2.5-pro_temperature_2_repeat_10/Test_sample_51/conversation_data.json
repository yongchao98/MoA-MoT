Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the population of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star goes from having no spots to having a spotted surface. The factor is defined as `(Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots)`.\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\n\nThe population of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, level 1 (`n1`, energy `E1`) and level 2 (`n2`, energy `E2`), is given by:\n\n`n1 / n2 = (g1 / g2) * exp(-(E1 - E2) / (k * T))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `g1` and `g2` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature of the gas.\n\nLet `R(T) = n1 / n2`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Information**\n\n*   **Temperature without spots (`T_nospot`):** The effective temperature of the unspotted star is 6000 K.\n*   **Temperature with spots (`T_with_spots`):** When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the *overall* effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The question relates the change in the population ratio to the presence of spots, implying a comparison between the two overall states of the star. Therefore, we should use the overall effective temperatures as the characteristic temperatures for the Boltzmann equation in each case.\n    *   `T1 = T_nospot = 6000 K`\n    *   `T2 = T_with_spots = 5500 K`\n*   **Wavelength of transition (`λ`):** The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of `λ = 1448 Å`. This allows us to calculate the energy difference between the levels, `ΔE = |E1 - E2|`.\n*   **Behavior of the ratio:** The problem states that the ratio `n1 / n2` *decreases* when the star has spots. This means `R(5500 K) < R(6000 K)`.\n\n**4. Determine the Relative Energies of the Levels**\n\nWe need to figure out which level has higher energy. Let's look at the Boltzmann equation again: `R(T) = (g1 / g2) * exp(-(E1 - E2) / (k * T))`.\n\nThe observation is that as `T` decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), the ratio `R(T)` also decreases.\n*   If `E1 > E2`, then `E1 - E2` is positive. As `T` decreases, `1/T` increases, so `-(E1 - E2) / (k * T)` becomes more negative, and `exp(...)` decreases. This matches the observation.\n*   If `E2 > E1`, then `E1 - E2` is negative. As `T` decreases, `1/T` increases, so `-(E1 - E2) / (k * T)` becomes more positive, and `exp(...)` increases. This contradicts the observation.\n\nTherefore, level 1 must be the higher energy level (`E1 > E2`).\n\n**5. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference is the energy of a photon with the given wavelength. We can use the formula `ΔE = hc / λ`. A convenient form of this is `ΔE(eV) = 12400 / λ(Å)`.\n\n`ΔE = E1 - E2 = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n\n**6. Set Up the Factor Calculation**\n\nWe need to calculate the factor `F = R(T1) / R(T2)`, where `T1 = 6000 K` and `T2 = 5500 K`.\n\n`R(T1) = (g1 / g2) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T1))`\n`R(T2) = (g1 / g2) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T2))`\n\n`F = R(T1) / R(T2) = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T1))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T2))]`\n`F = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)]`\n`F = exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)]`\n\n**7. Compute the Final Value**\n\nWe will use the following constants:\n*   `ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n*   Boltzmann constant, `k ≈ 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term `ΔE / k`:\n`ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K) ≈ 99379 K`\n\nNow, plug this into the expression for the factor `F`:\n`F = exp[99379 * (1/5500 - 1/6000)]`\n`F = exp[99379 * ((6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000))]`\n`F = exp[99379 * (500 / 33,000,000)]`\n`F = exp[99379 * (1.51515... x 10^-5)]`\n`F = exp(1.5057...)`\n`F ≈ 4.507`\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option C.\n\nTo confirm with a script:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nk_B_eV = 8.617333e-5  # Boltzmann constant in eV/K\nhc_eV_A = 12400      # hc product in eV * Angstrom\n\n# Given values\nT_nospot = 6000.0  # T1\nT_with_spots = 5500.0 # T2\nwavelength_A = 1448.0\n\n# Calculate the energy difference\ndelta_E = hc_eV_A / wavelength_A\n\n# The ratio n1/n2 decreases as T decreases, so E1 > E2.\n# Factor = Ratio(T_nospot) / Ratio(T_with_spots)\n# Factor = exp[(-delta_E / k) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_with_spots)]\n# Factor = exp[(delta_E / k) * (1/T_with_spots - 1/T_nospot)]\n\nexponent = (delta_E / k_B_eV) * (1 / T_with_spots - 1 / T_nospot)\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=:.2f}\")\n\n```\nThe code will compute the same value.\n\n```\nfactor=4.51\n```\n\nThe result is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two different energy levels changes as the star's effective temperature changes due to spots. The factor is `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`.\n\n**1. Identify the Relevant Physics**\n\nThe population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere, assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio `R` of the populations of two levels, level 1 (`n1`) and level 2 (`n2`), is given by:\n\n`R = n1 / n2 = (g1 / g2) * exp(-(E1 - E2) / (k * T))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `g1`, `g2` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   `E1`, `E2` are the energies of the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\n**2. Define the Temperatures and the Factor**\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n*   No spots: Temperature `T_nospot` = 6000 K\n*   With spots: Overall effective temperature `T_spots` = 5500 K\n\nThe factor `F` we want to find is the ratio of the population ratios at these two temperatures:\n\n`F = R(T_nospot) / R(T_spots)`\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`F = [ (g1/g2) * exp(-(E1 - E2) / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp(-(E1 - E2) / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\nThe statistical weights `g1/g2` cancel out:\n\n`F = exp(-(E1 - E2) / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-(E1 - E2) / (k * T_spots))`\n\nUsing the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n`F = exp[ -((E1 - E2)/k) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spots) ]`\n`F = exp[ ((E1 - E2)/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospot) ]`\n\nLet `ΔE = E1 - E2`.\n\n**3. Determine the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. We can calculate this using the formula `ΔE = hc / λ`. A useful version of this formula for astrophysics is `ΔE (in eV) = 12400 / λ (in Å)`.\n\n`ΔE = 12400 / 1448 Å ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n\nThe problem states that the ratio `n1/n2` *decreases* when the star has spots (i.e., as `T` drops from 6000 K to 5500 K). This implies that `E1` is the higher energy level, so `ΔE = E1 - E2` is positive. Our formula `F = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospot) ]` is consistent with this, as `(1/5500 - 1/6000)` is positive, leading to `F > 1`, which means the ratio was indeed higher at the higher temperature.\n\n**4. Calculate the Factor**\n\nNow we plug in the values:\n*   `ΔE` ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   Boltzmann constant, `k` ≈ 8.617333 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   `T_nospot` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spots` = 5500 K\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the exponent:\n\n*   `ΔE / k` ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617333 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99375 K\n*   `(1/T_spots - 1/T_nospot)` = `(1/5500 - 1/6000)` = `(12/66000 - 11/66000)` = `1/66000 K⁻¹` ≈ 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n\nNow, the exponent is:\n`Exponent ≈ 99375 K * (1/66000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057`\n\nFinally, the factor is:\n`F = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507`\n\nThis value is very close to 4.5. The code output `factor=4.51` confirms this result.\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
