    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Scenario:** The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun stops. This cessation happened about 8.5 minutes ago, so the effects are just reaching Earth now (as neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light).\n    *   **Condition:** All other neutrino-producing reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) continue as normal.\n    *   **Question:** We need to find the approximate ratio of the neutrino flux in energy band 1 (700-800 keV) to the flux in energy band 2 (800-900 keV).\n    *   Ratio = Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2).\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources and their Energies:**\n    We need to know which solar reactions produce neutrinos and at what energies to see which ones contribute to our energy bands.\n    *   **pp-I Chain:** `p + p → ...` produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. This is below both bands.\n    *   **pp-II Chain:** This branch has a key reaction: `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`. This produces a mono-energetic (line) spectrum. The dominant line is at **861 keV**. This line falls squarely within our band 2 (800-900 keV).\n    *   **pp-III Chain:** This branch starts with the `⁸B → ...` decay, producing neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. These neutrinos *would* contribute to both band 1 and band 2. However, the problem states this branch **has stopped**. Therefore, there are **no neutrinos from ⁸B**.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** Reactions involving Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen produce neutrinos with continuous spectra. The main ones are from ¹³N decay (up to 1.20 MeV) and ¹⁵O decay (up to 1.73 MeV). These continuous spectra contribute to **both** band 1 and band 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Flux in Each Band under the Hypothetical Scenario:**\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   pp-I neutrinos: No (energy too low).\n        *   pp-II (⁷Be) neutrinos: No (line is at 861 keV).\n        *   pp-III (⁸B) neutrinos: No (branch is stopped).\n        *   CNO neutrinos: **Yes**. This is the only source for band 1. The flux comes from a small segment of the continuous spectra of ¹³N and ¹⁵O neutrinos.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   pp-I neutrinos: No.\n        *   pp-II (⁷Be) neutrinos: **Yes**. The very intense line at 861 keV contributes its *entire* flux to this band.\n        *   pp-III (⁸B) neutrinos: No.\n        *   CNO neutrinos: **Yes**. This band also receives a contribution from the continuous spectra of CNO neutrinos.\n\n4.  **Qualitative and Quantitative Comparison:**\n    The ratio we need is:\n    Ratio = Flux(CNO in 700-800 keV band) / [Flux(⁷Be line at 861 keV) + Flux(CNO in 800-900 keV band)]\n\n    Let's compare the magnitudes of these fluxes using values from the Standard Solar Model.\n\n    *   **⁷Be Flux:** The total flux of the 861 keV ⁷Be line is very large, approximately **Φ(⁷Be) ≈ 4.5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**. Since this is a line source, its entire flux is concentrated in Band 2.\n    *   **CNO Flux:** The total flux from the main CNO sources (¹³N and ¹⁵O) is approximately **Φ(CNO, total) ≈ 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**. This flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV).\n\n    Now, let's look at the components of our ratio:\n    *   **Denominator (Flux in Band 2):** It consists of the huge ⁷Be flux plus a small contribution from the CNO neutrinos. The CNO contribution in this 100 keV-wide band will be only a small fraction of the total CNO flux. It is completely dwarfed by the ⁷Be line flux. Therefore, we can make a very safe approximation:\n        Flux(band 2) ≈ Flux(⁷Be line) ≈ 4.5 x 10⁹.\n    *   **Numerator (Flux in Band 1):** This is the flux from CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV window. This is a 100 keV (0.1 MeV) slice of a spectrum that spans about 1.7 MeV. Let's estimate the fraction of the total CNO flux that falls in this band. The spectra peak at lower energies and fall off, so the flux density in this band is not at its maximum. A reasonable estimate is that this 100 keV window contains perhaps 10% of the total CNO flux.\n        Flux(band 1) ≈ 10% of Φ(CNO, total) ≈ 0.1 * (5 x 10⁸) = 5 x 10⁷.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    Ratio = Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (4.5 x 10⁹)\n    Ratio ≈ 5 / 450 = 1 / 90\n    Ratio ≈ 0.011\n\nThis value is extremely close to 0.01. The key insight is the overwhelming dominance of the monoenergetic ⁷Be neutrino line in the 800-900 keV band compared to the relatively small flux from a narrow slice of the continuous CNO spectrum in the 700-800 keV band.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) 10.\nB) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nC) 1.\nD) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\nOur calculated ratio of ~0.011 is an excellent match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
