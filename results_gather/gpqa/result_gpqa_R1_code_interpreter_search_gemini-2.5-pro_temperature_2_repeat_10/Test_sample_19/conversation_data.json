    "An analysis of the assumptions is as follows:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the foundational idea of the impulse approximation. The total nuclear interaction is treated as an incoherent sum of interactions with single nucleons. This neglects multi-nucleon processes like meson-exchange currents. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption means that we neglect \"final-state interactions\" (and initial-state interactions). In other words, the incoming probe and the outgoing particles are assumed not to interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. While more sophisticated models (like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation) relax this, it is a key component of the simplest form, the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), and is necessary to directly equate the observed process to a free-nucleon process.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic:** This is an assumption about the internal structure of the nucleon itself, often used in specific models like the non-relativistic quark model. The impulse approximation, however, is a framework for describing the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus*. It is independent of the specific model used for the nucleon's internal structure. One can use the impulse approximation with nucleon form factors derived from either relativistic or non-relativistic models. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. It assumes that the interaction happens over a very short timescale, so short that the nucleon's interaction with the surrounding nuclear potential is negligible during the event. The nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in its state for the duration of the high-energy collision and responds as if it were a free particle, not a bound one. This assumption is crucial.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
