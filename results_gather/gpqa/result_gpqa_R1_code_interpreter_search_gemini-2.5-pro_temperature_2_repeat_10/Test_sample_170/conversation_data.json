    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the factors influencing product distribution.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent (X) determines the position of the incoming bromine atom.\n- **Activating groups** donate electron density to the ring, speed up the reaction, and direct the incoming electrophile to the **ortho and para** positions.\n- **Deactivating groups** withdraw electron density from the ring, slow down the reaction, and direct the incoming electrophile to the **meta** position.\n- **Halogens** are an exception: they are deactivating but direct to the **ortho and para** positions.\n\nThe question asks to order the substances by the increasing yield of the **para-isomer**. This means we need to compare the percentage of para-product formed for each substance.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nLet's analyze the substituent for each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 (methyl) is an activating group, ortho, para-directing.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 (ester) is a deactivating group, meta-directing.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl (chloro) is a deactivating group, but it is ortho, para-directing.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 (nitro) is a very strong deactivating group, meta-directing.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 (ethyl) is an activating group, ortho, para-directing.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH (carboxylic acid) is a deactivating group, meta-directing.\n\nWe can split the substances into two groups:\n*   **Group A (meta-directors):** 2, 4, 6. These will produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n*   **Group B (ortho, para-directors):** 1, 3, 5. These will produce significant yields of the para-isomer.\n\nLogically, any substance from Group A will have a lower para-yield than any substance from Group B.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within Group A (meta-directors).**\nThe substances are nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2). For meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, and consequently, an even lower yield of the minor ortho and para isomers. We need to rank them by the strength of their deactivating effect.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is the strongest deactivator, followed by carboxylic acid. The ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group).\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of the deactivating strength:\nYield(para-nitrobenzene) < Yield(para-benzoic acid) < Yield(para-ethyl benzoate)\n\nThis corresponds to the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within Group B (ortho, para-directors).**\nThe substances are toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3). For these, the para-isomer is a major product. The percentage of the para-isomer depends on the para/ortho ratio, which is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3):** The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. The typical yield of the para-isomer is around 62%.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors substitution at the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the relative yield of the para-isomer. The para yield is higher than for toluene, typically around 70%.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens are a special case. While they deactivate the ring overall, they direct ortho/para. The strong inductive (-I) effect of chlorine deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of chlorine, strongly favors the para-position. The yield of the para-isomer is very high, around 89%.\n\nComparing the para-isomer yields:\nYield(Toluene, 62%) < Yield(Ethylbenzene, 70%) < Yield(Chlorobenzene, 89%)\n\nThis corresponds to the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the orders of the two groups.**\nWe established that the para-yield for Group A is much lower than for Group B. So, we place the ordered Group A before the ordered Group B.\n\nGroup A order: **4 < 6 < 2**\nGroup B order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
