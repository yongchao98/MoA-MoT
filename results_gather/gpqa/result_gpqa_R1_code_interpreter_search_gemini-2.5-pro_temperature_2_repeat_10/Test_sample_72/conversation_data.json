    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Mass of the first astronaut, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Speed of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Mass of the second astronaut, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Speed of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Both astronauts are traveling in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Calculate the relative speed ($v_{rel}$):**\nThe formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction in special relativity is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total energy of the system ($E_{total}$):**\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the relativistic energies of its individual components. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**a. Calculate the energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_1/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}}$\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}}$\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2$\n$E_1 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**b. Calculate the energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_2/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}}$\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}}$\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2$\n$E_2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\nTo get a numerical value, use the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_2 \\approx 2 \\times 1.732 \\times mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**c. Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n$E_{total} = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**4. Compare the results with the given options:**\n*   Calculated relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Calculated total energy: $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\nA) $v_{rel} = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2$\nB) $v_{rel} = 1.1c , E= mc^2$\nC) $v_{rel} =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2$\nD) $v_{rel}=0.14c, E=5mc^2$\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
