    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile:**\n    *   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n    *   This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of alkene protons.\n    *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks correspond to the alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n    *   This specific set of data uniquely identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry that makes its two alkene protons equivalent and its two alkene carbons equivalent, as well as its two carbonyl carbons equivalent. Its molecular formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene and Analyze Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The diene is given as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's determine its structure and formula. It's a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4, and methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₂.\n    *   The product of a simple Diels-Alder reaction between the diene (C₉H₁₂) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) would be C₁₃H₁₄O₃ (C₉H₁₂ + C₄H₂O₃).\n    *   However, the problem explicitly states the molecular formula of the products is **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This product has two more hydrogen atoms than the expected Diels-Alder adduct.\n    *   This discrepancy implies that the Diels-Alder reaction is followed by a reduction step, specifically the hydrogenation of the remaining double bond in the bicyclic adduct.\n    *   So, the reaction sequence is:\n        1.  Diels-Alder: C₉H₁₂ + C₄H₂O₃ → C₁₃H₁₄O₃ (endo/exo isomers)\n        2.  Hydrogenation: C₁₃H₁₄O₃ + H₂ → C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (saturated endo/exo isomers)\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile typically yields two stereoisomers: the *endo* product (major, kinetically favored) and the *exo* product (minor, thermodynamically favored).\n    *   **Major Product (derived from *endo* adduct):** In the initial *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the C7-CH₂ group). The double bond in this adduct is sterically hindered from the *endo* face by the anhydride ring itself. Therefore, catalytic hydrogenation (addition of H₂) will occur from the less hindered *exo* face. This pushes the two methyl groups that were on the double bond into the *endo* position. The final major product has both the anhydride ring's protons and the two methyl groups on the C5-C6 bridge in the *endo* position.\n    *   **Minor Product (derived from *exo* adduct):** In the initial *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. Now, the *exo* face of the double bond is hindered by the anhydride ring. Hydrogenation will occur from the *endo* face. This pushes the two methyl groups into the *exo* position. The final minor product has both the anhydride ring's protons and the methyl groups on the C5-C6 bridge in the *exo* position.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close only in the major isomer.\n    *   **In the major product (hydrogenated *endo* adduct):** As determined above, the protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule are *endo*, and the methyl groups on the C5-C6 part of the skeleton are also *endo*. Due to the rigid, cage-like structure of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system, these two sets of *endo* groups are forced into close proximity. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the minor product (hydrogenated *exo* adduct):** The corresponding protons (on the anhydride) and methyl groups are both in the *exo* position. In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework, *exo* groups on the C2/C3 bridge and the C5/C6 bridge are on opposite sides of the molecule and far apart. Thus, no significant NOE cross-peak is expected.\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   We need to identify the signals for the two groups involved in the NOE of the major product.\n    *   **Signal 1: The protons on the anhydride ring.** The product has a plane of symmetry, making these two protons equivalent. They are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift would be relatively high, around 3.0-4.0 ppm. The integral would be 2H. Looking at the options, **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is a perfect match.\n    *   **Signal 2: The methyl groups at the C5 and C6 positions.** The symmetry plane also makes these two methyl groups equivalent. They are on saturated (sp³) carbons in a strained ring. Their signal would be a singlet with an integral of 6H. A typical chemical shift for such methyl groups is around 1-2 ppm. From the options, **a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the most reasonable assignment. (The other 6H singlet at ~1 ppm likely corresponds to the bridgehead methyl groups, which are in a different chemical environment).\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak in the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (endo methyls) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (endo anhydride protons).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The choice that matches this conclusion is: **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
