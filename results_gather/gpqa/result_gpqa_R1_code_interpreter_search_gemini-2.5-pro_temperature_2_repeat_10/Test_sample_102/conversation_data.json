    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's draw its structure. The parent is ethanone (an acetyl group, -COCH3) attached to a phenyl ring. The substituents on the phenyl ring are:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a meta-relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent affects further electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthesis Routes**\n\nLet's consider putting the groups on one by one.\n\n*   **Route 1: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position. Now we have substituents at positions 1 and 3.\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They will both direct an incoming electrophile (Br+) to position C5. This route is chemically sound from a directing-effects standpoint and would produce the desired 1-acetyl-3-bromo-5-nitrobenzene. However, the ring is heavily deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, which can make the final bromination step low-yielding. This specific sequence is not one of the options.\n\n*   **Route 2: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works.\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Now we have a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The bromine is the stronger director (less deactivating). It directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* (C2, C4) and *para* (C6) positions. The *meta*-director (-COCH3) directs to C5. The major products would be 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone and 1-(3-bromo-6-nitrophenyl)ethanone, not the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone. Thus, this route will not give a high yield of the target molecule.\n\nSince simple routes have flaws or are not listed, we must consider more complex syntheses involving the modification or removal of directing groups. The presence of reagents for reduction of nitro groups (Fe/HCl) and deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests such a strategy.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).\n    *   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings. The presence of a nitro group prevents this reaction. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    *   This sequence of the first four steps simply converts benzene back to benzene, which makes no synthetic sense. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a deactivating -NH3+ group, which would direct *meta*. So, we might get 3-aminoacetophenone. Let's follow this.\n    *   iv) Bromination of 3-aminoacetophenone. The -NH2 group is a very strong *ortho, para*-director and will control the substitution, leading to bromination at positions 2, 4, or 6, not the required position 5.\n    *   Alternatively, step iii) might represent N-acylation (protection) to form acetanilide. The sequence would then proceed with further substitutions that, as explored in other cases, do not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    Let's trace this synthetic pathway carefully.\n    1.  **i) Acylation:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. (-COCH3 is a meta-director). Correct.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → **1-(3-Bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. As discussed, nitration is directed by the Br to positions 4 and 6. We can assume the 4-nitro isomer is formed as a major product and can be separated for the next step.\n    4.  **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one → **1-(4-Amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    5.  **v) Nitration:** We nitrate 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. Under the acidic conditions (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. To ensure correct directing, it's more likely that the amino group is first protected as an amide (-NHCOCH3), which is a strong *ortho, para*-director, and this protection step is implied. Let's analyze the directing effects with a protected amino group (acetamido group, -NHCOCH3) at position 4.\n        *   The powerful activating acetamido group at C4 directs *ortho* to it, which is C3 (occupied by Br) and C5.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1 is a *meta*-director, directing to C5.\n        *   Both key groups direct the incoming nitro group to C5. Product: **1-(4-acetamido-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. (After reaction, the protecting group needs to be removed by hydrolysis, an implied step). This gives **1-(4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    6.  **vi) Diazotization:** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom using H3PO2.\n\nThe removal of the temporary directing group at position 4 leaves the final substituents at the desired positions: Acetyl (C1), Bromo (C3), and Nitro (C5). This complex but logical pathway successfully produces the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A outlines a valid, albeit sophisticated, synthetic route that utilizes a temporary directing group (which starts as a nitro group, is converted to an amine, and then removed) to achieve the desired 1,3,5 substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically flawed steps.\n\n<<<A>>>"
