    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula:\nMass Fraction (H) = (m × Ar(H)) / (n × Ar(C) + m × Ar(H))\nUsing approximate atomic masses, Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n0.1428 = m / (12n + m)\nLet's rearrange the formula to find the ratio m/n:\nm = 0.1428 × (12n + m)\nm = 1.7136n + 0.1428m\nm - 0.1428m = 1.7136n\n0.8572m = 1.7136n\nm/n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0\n\nThis means the empirical formula for Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. Acyclic alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2.\nSo, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\nZ is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) and is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the formula CnH2n. The C6 ring system is very common in these types of reactions. Let's hypothesize that Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\nMixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Let mixture Y be {Z, D}.\nSince Y is a product of disproportionation, one component should be a \"reduced\" product and the other an \"oxidized\" product (in terms of hydrogen content).\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is the reduced product.\n*   The other component, D, must be the oxidized (dehydrogenated) product. It must also have a C6 skeleton, as hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. It must not decolorize bromine water.\nThe most stable dehydrogenation product of a C6 cyclic system is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatically stable and does not react with bromine water.\nSo, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\nLet's check the hydrogenation condition for Y:\n*   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) yields cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) requires severe conditions (which is mentioned in the problem) and yields cyclohexane (Z): C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\nThis confirms our identification of mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} and Z = cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. The reaction is:\nA + B → Y (equimolar mixture of C6H12 and C6H6)\nSo, the reaction is:\nA + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nWe are told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means:\n*   A + H2 → C6H12\n*   B + H2 → C6H12\nThis implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons with a carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to that of cyclohexane.\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry A + B → C6H12 + C6H6, we can balance the atoms. Since A and B are both C6 hydrocarbons, let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\nC6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6\nBalancing hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of two C6 hydrocarbons, C6Hx and C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\nThe problem also gives two crucial constraints for mixture X:\n1.  It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds). This implies x < 12 and y < 12 (since C6H12 is the saturated cycloalkane).\n2.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\nWe need to find two even integers x and y such that x + y = 18 and x, y < 12. The only reasonable pair is x = 10 and y = 8.\nSo, the components of mixture X are A = C6H10 and B = C6H8.\n\nLet's find plausible structures:\n*   **A = C6H10**: A cycloalkene with a C6 ring. The simplest choice is **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond (decolorizes Br2 water) and no conjugated bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n*   **B = C6H8**: A cycloalkadiene with a C6 ring. We need a non-conjugated isomer. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, so it is ruled out. **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene** has two isolated double bonds, so it is not conjugated. It decolorizes Br2 water and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n\nThe reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nIn this disproportionation, the cyclohexa-1,4-diene gives up hydrogen (is oxidized) to become benzene, and the cyclohexene accepts that hydrogen (is reduced) to become cyclohexane. This process explains how an equimolar mixture of reactants produces an equimolar mixture of products. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n*   Liquid A has the formula C6H10, so it has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B has the formula C6H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
