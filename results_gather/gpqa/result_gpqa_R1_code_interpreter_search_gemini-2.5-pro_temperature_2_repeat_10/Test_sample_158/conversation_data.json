    "*   **Step 1: Identify the physical process.**\n    The problem describes a peak in a quasar's spectrum at 790 nm, with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This feature is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha break. The peak at 790 nm is the quasar's own Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) emission line, which has been redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. The flux drop at shorter wavelengths is caused by the absorption of this light by the intervening neutral hydrogen clouds in the intergalactic medium, an effect known as the Lyman-alpha forest.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the redshift (z).**\n    To find the redshift, we compare the observed wavelength (λ_obs) of the Ly-α line with its known rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition in a hydrogen atom is approximately 121.6 nm (or more precisely, 121.567 nm).\n\n    The redshift `z` is defined by the formula:\n    `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`\n    `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `z = (790 nm / 121.567 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.50 - 1 = 5.5`\n\n    The Python script calculated a more precise value: `z = 5.4985`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the comoving distance (D_C).**\n    The problem provides the cosmological parameters for a flat Lambda-CDM model: H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, Ωₘ = 0.3, and Ω_Λ = 0.7. Since Ωₘ + Ω_Λ = 1, the universe is indeed flat (Ω_k = 0).\n\n    For a flat universe, the comoving distance is calculated by integrating over the redshift:\n    `D_C = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ωₘ(1+z')³ + Ω_Λ)`\n    where `D_H = c / H₀` is the Hubble distance and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Step 4: Execute the calculation.**\n    This integral is complex to solve analytically and is best done numerically. I have used a Python script to perform this calculation.\n    *   First, the redshift was calculated: `z = 5.4985`.\n    *   Then, using this redshift and the given cosmological parameters, the script numerically integrated the comoving distance formula.\n    *   The output of the script shows the comoving distance to be `8.0239 Gpc`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare with options.**\n    The calculated comoving distance of approximately 8.02 Gpc is very close to 8 Gpc.\n\n    *   A) 7 Gpc\n    *   B) 6 Gpc\n    *   C) 9 Gpc\n    *   D) 8 Gpc\n\n    The value that can be assumed for the comoving distance of the quasar is 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<D>>>"
