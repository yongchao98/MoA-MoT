    "This problem requires analyzing the kinematics of two nuclear decay processes. Let's break down the physics principles involved.\n\n### **1. Nature of Energy Spectra in Decays**\n\nThe key to determining whether an energy spectrum is continuous or discrete lies in the number of particles in the final state of the decay.\n\n*   **Two-body decay (A -> B + C):** When a particle at rest decays into two other particles, the laws of conservation of energy and momentum completely determine the energies of the outgoing particles. Each particle will have a single, fixed kinetic energy. This results in a **discrete** energy spectrum (a sharp line or peak).\n\n*   **Three-or-more-body decay (A -> B + C + D + ...):** When a particle at rest decays into three or more particles, the conservation laws are no longer sufficient to uniquely determine the energy of each final particle. The total energy released (the Q-value) can be distributed among the kinetic energies of the final particles in a continuous range of possibilities. This results in a **continuous** energy spectrum for any of the final particles, ranging from zero up to a maximum value (the endpoint).\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Decay Processes**\n\nLet's apply this to the two decays described in the question.\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    The final state consists of 6 particles (two B's, two E's, and two V's). Since the number of final particles is greater than two, the available energy is shared among them in various ways. This is why, as stated in the problem, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is **continuous**.\n\n*   **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    In this case, the final state consists of 5 particles (two B's, two E's, and one M). Again, the number of final particles is greater than two. Therefore, the total energy of the two E particles will still be distributed over a continuous range. The spectrum **remains continuous**.\n\nThis analysis immediately eliminates options A and B, which state that the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### **3. Comparing the Endpoints of the Spectra**\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible kinetic energy that the particle(s) of interest (here, the two E particles combined) can have. This maximum energy is determined by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value.\n\nThe Q-value is calculated from the mass difference between the initial and final states, according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, E=mc².\n\n`Q = (Mass_initial - Mass_final) * c²`\n\nLet's calculate the Q-value for each decay. Let `m_A`, `m_B`, `m_E`, `m_V`, and `m_M` be the masses of the respective particles.\n\n*   **Q-value of Original Decay (Q_original):**\n    `Mass_initial = 2 * m_A`\n    `Mass_final = (2 * m_B) + (2 * m_E) + (2 * m_V)`\n    `Q_original = [2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V)] * c²`\n\n*   **Q-value of Variant Decay (Q_variant):**\n    `Mass_initial = 2 * m_A`\n    `Mass_final = (2 * m_B) + (2 * m_E) + m_M`\n    `Q_variant = [2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + m_M)] * c²`\n\nNow, we use the information given in the problem:\n*   The particle M is **massless**, so `m_M = 0`.\n*   The particles V are described as \"lighter particles,\" which implies they have a small but non-zero mass, so `m_V > 0`.\n\nLet's substitute `m_M = 0` into the equation for `Q_variant`:\n`Q_variant = [2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E)] * c²`\n\nComparing the two Q-values:\n`Q_variant - Q_original = [ (2*m_A - 2*m_B - 2*m_E) - (2*m_A - 2*m_B - 2*m_E - 2*m_V) ] * c²`\n`Q_variant - Q_original = (2 * m_V) * c²`\n\nSince `m_V > 0`, the term `(2 * m_V) * c²` is positive. Therefore, `Q_variant > Q_original`.\n\nThis means more total energy is released in the variant decay. A larger Q-value means that the maximum possible kinetic energy available to the final particles is higher. Consequently, the endpoint of the energy spectrum for the E particles **increases**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn the variant decay, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous, and the endpoint of this spectrum increases because more energy is liberated in the decay. The change in the number and nature of the final-state particles also means the statistical distribution of energy will be different, so the spectrum will have an \"adjusted shape.\"\n\nThis corresponds perfectly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
