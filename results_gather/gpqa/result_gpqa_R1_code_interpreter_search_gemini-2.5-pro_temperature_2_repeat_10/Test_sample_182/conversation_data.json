    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break down this name to determine its structure and molecular formula.\n    *   `cyclohex`: This indicates a six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   `-3-ene`: There is a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group is present. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\n    Based on this structure, let's determine its molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the -CH=CH2 group = 10 carbons. So, C=10.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** We can count them systematically. The cyclohexane ring with one double bond (cyclohexene) has the formula C6H10. We replace H atoms with substituents.\n        *   An H is removed from C1 to attach -COOH.\n        *   An H is removed from C2 to attach -CHO.\n        *   An H is removed from C5 to attach -CH=CH2.\n        *   The base ring is C6H7 (10 H in cyclohexene - 3 H replaced).\n        *   Now add hydrogens from the substituents: 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, and 3 in -CH=CH2.\n        *   Total H = 7 (on ring) + 1 (from COOH) + 1 (from CHO) + 3 (from vinyl) = 12 hydrogens. So, H=12.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group = 3 oxygens. So, O=3.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C=C) will be reduced to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to form an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:**\n    The reaction completely reduces the reactant to a saturated hydrocarbon, while keeping the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The substituents on the ring become:\n        *   At C1: -CH3 (from the original -COOH)\n        *   At C2: -CH3 (from the original -CHO)\n        *   At C5: -CH2CH3 (from the original -CH=CH2)\n    *   The product is an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it would be an isomer of ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane (e.g., 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane based on IUPAC naming, but the exact isomer name is not required).\n\n    Let's find the molecular formula of this product.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** The number of carbon atoms remains the same. C = 10.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** Since the product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a cycloalkane), its general formula is CnH2n. With n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction. O = 0.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    (Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, and N is nitrogens. Halogens are treated like H).\n\n    For the product with the formula C10H20:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0/2 + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n    This IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane skeleton in the product molecule. All other parts of the molecule are saturated.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) 0 - Would mean an acyclic alkane.\nB) 5 - This is the IHD of the reactant, not the product.\nC) 1 - Correct, corresponds to a single ring in a saturated hydrocarbon.\nD) 3 - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
