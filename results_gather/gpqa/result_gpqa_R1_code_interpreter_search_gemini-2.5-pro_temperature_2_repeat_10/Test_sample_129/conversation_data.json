    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength (λ₀):** This is the rest-frame wavelength of a specific spectral line of neutral hydrogen, given as λ₀ ≈ 1216 Angstroms (Å).\n    *   **Redshift (z):** The light from distant objects is stretched by the expansion of the universe. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest-frame wavelength (λ₀) and the redshift (z) by the formula: `λ_obs = λ₀ * (1 + z)`.\n    *   **Ground-based Optical Telescopes:** These telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs most of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from space. This sets a minimum wavelength that can be observed from the ground. This is known as the atmospheric cutoff.\n    *   **Lower Limit:** We need to find the smallest redshift 'z' that allows the redshifted Lyα line to be observed from the ground.\n\n2.  **Determine the Atmospheric Cutoff Wavelength:**\n    *   The Earth's atmosphere, primarily the ozone layer, is opaque to wavelengths shorter than about 310-320 nanometers (nm), which is 3100-3200 Å.\n    *   However, for practical spectroscopic observations of faint objects like quasars, a more conservative limit is often used where the atmospheric transmission is significantly better. A reasonable estimate for the effective start of the ground-based \"optical\" window for this kind of work is around 350 nm or 3500 Å. Let's use this value (λ_limit = 3500 Å) for our calculation.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equation:**\n    *   For the Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be detectable, its observed wavelength must be greater than or equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength: `λ_obs ≥ λ_limit`.\n    *   To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength equal to the limit: `λ_obs = λ_limit`.\n    *   Substituting the redshift formula: `λ₀ * (1 + z) = λ_limit`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Redshift (z):**\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for z:\n        `1 + z = λ_limit / λ₀`\n        `z = (λ_limit / λ₀) - 1`\n    *   Now, we plug in the values:\n        `λ₀ = 1216 Å`\n        `λ_limit = 3500 Å`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    *   I will use Python to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Rest-frame wavelength of Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms\nlambda_0 = 1216\n\n# Effective lower limit for ground-based optical observation in Angstroms\n# This is due to atmospheric absorption in the ultraviolet.\n# A practical limit for good spectroscopic observation is around 350 nm = 3500 A.\nlambda_limit = 3500\n\n# The formula for redshift is: lambda_obs = lambda_0 * (1 + z)\n# To find the lower limit on z, we set lambda_obs = lambda_limit\n# So, lambda_limit = lambda_0 * (1 + z)\n# Solving for z: z = (lambda_limit / lambda_0) - 1\n\nz = (lambda_limit / lambda_0) - 1\n\nprint(z)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields a redshift value of approximately 1.878.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated redshift `z ≈ 1.88` is very close to option B.\n\n    A) 1.2\n    B) 1.9\n    C) 2.4\n    D) 3\n\n    The estimated lower limit on the redshift is ~1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>",
