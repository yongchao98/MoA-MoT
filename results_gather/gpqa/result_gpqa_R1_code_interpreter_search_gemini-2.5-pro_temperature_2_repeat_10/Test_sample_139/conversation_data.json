    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The melting point of B.**\n    The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an extremely strong clue that substance **B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: The nature of Substance X.**\n    Substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope\" of one of its constituent elements. This, combined with the identification of B as D₂O, strongly suggests that the isotope in question is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence.**\n    *   Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G (This reaction is violent).\n    *   Precipitate G (when heated) → Substance B (D₂O) + other products.\n    *   Since heating G yields D₂O, G must be a substance that contains deuterium and oxygen, and which can decompose to yield D₂O. A deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)n, is a perfect candidate, as metal hydroxides decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. So, M(OD)n(s) → MxOy(s) + D₂O(g).\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 3: The nature of Gas W.**\n    The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's test some simple gas molecules that could be formed.\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n    *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. (No)\n    *   **D₂: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)**\n    *   Many other larger gases also fit (N₂, O₂, CH₄, etc.), but D₂ is the most plausible gas to be released when a deuterated reagent reacts, especially if D₂O is involved.\n\n5.  **Synthesize Clues to Identify X, Y, G, and W.**\n    We need a reaction involving a deuterated reagent (X) that produces D₂ gas (W) and a solid deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) when reacting with a liquid (Y). Let's test common deuterated reagents.\n    *   **Candidate for X:** Let's consider **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, fitting Clue 8. LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water, fitting Clue 2.\n    *   **Proposing the Reaction:** Let's test the reaction of X = LiAlD₄ with Y = D₂O (heavy water, which is a liquid).\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Let's check if this fits all the clues:**\n        *   **Reaction:** Violent, as expected. (Clue 2)\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches Clue 3.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, **Al(OD)₃**, would also be a precipitate. This matches Clue 4.\n        *   **Heating G:** When heated, Al(OD)₃ would decompose: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases **D₂O**, which we identified as substance B. This matches Clue 5.\n    *   All clues so far point to X being LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Final Clue (Clue 7): The Keto Acid Reaction.**\n    \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has two functional groups: a ketone (-CO-) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For example, pyruvic acid: CH₃-CO-COOH.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone (-CO-) is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-).\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n    *   So, the reaction with a keto acid like pyruvic acid would be:\n        `CH₃-CO-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄, 2. H₂O workup)--> CH₃-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`\n    *   The final product molecule is a diol (contains two alcohol groups). Let's count the oxygen atoms in this product: there is one oxygen in the first -OH group and one in the second -OH group, for a **total of 2 oxygen atoms**. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n7.  **Final Identification and Calculation.**\n    *   Substance X is definitively **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n    *   The elements present in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in X.\n        *   Atomic number of H: 1\n        *   Atomic number of Li: 3\n        *   Atomic number of Al: 13\n    *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** (present as D) and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We will use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for each isotope.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are 4 deuterium atoms.\n        *   The common stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is 1 aluminum atom.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
