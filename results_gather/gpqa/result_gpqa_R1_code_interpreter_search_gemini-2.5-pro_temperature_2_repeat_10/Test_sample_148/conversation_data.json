    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The observation of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which do not arise from spin-spin coupling, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the peaks have roughly equal integrals suggests that these two environments are populated in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct components, as shown by the two peaks. This confirms the presence of two different chemical species. The mass spectrometry (MS) data is crucial: both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule. This means the two species are isomers â€“ they have the same chemical formula but different structures. The elevated temperature is a key detail, often used to study dynamic processes like conformational changes.\n\n*   **Connecting the Data to the Peptide Context:** The compound is a peptide. Peptides are characterized by amide bonds (-C(=O)-NH-). Due to resonance, the C-N bond in an amide has significant double-bond character, which severely restricts free rotation. This restricted rotation leads to the possibility of *cis* and *trans* conformers around the amide bond.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Isomer Types:**\n    *   These *cis* and *trans* conformers are a type of **diastereomer** (specifically, they are atropisomers, which are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation). They are not mirror images of each other.\n    *   Because they are diastereomers, they are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. The alpha-proton next to the slowly-rotating amide bond will have a different chemical shift in the *cis* isomer compared to the *trans* isomer, explaining the two NMR peaks.\n    *   Their different shapes and polarities will cause them to interact differently with the chromatography column, leading to two separate peaks in the LC.\n    *   Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, explaining the identical mass spectra.\n    *   The slow interconversion between the *cis* and *trans* forms on the NMR timescale results in sharp, separate peaks rather than a single broad, coalesced peak. The two forms are in equilibrium, and for some peptide linkages (especially involving proline), the energy difference between *cis* and *trans* is small, leading to significant populations of both, consistent with the 1:1 ratio observed.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is a perfect fit for the observations, with the two diastereomers being the *cis* and *trans* conformers around an amide bond.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred:** This would produce a molecule with a different (higher) mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR or LC experiment, they are indistinguishable and would produce only a single set of NMR peaks and a single LC peak. This contradicts the data.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight, which contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the mass of the expected product.\n\nTherefore, the most logical explanation is the presence of diastereomers arising from restricted rotation about an amide bond.\n\n<<<A>>>"
