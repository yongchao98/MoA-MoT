These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate (`CH2(COOMe)2`), methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe`), and a base (NaOEt in EtOH).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (between the two ester groups) are highly acidic. NaOEt will remove one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `[-]CH(COOMe)2`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon-carbon double bond is activated by the electron-withdrawing ester group, making the β-carbon electrophilic.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`\n*   **Mechanism**: The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and then the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen to form an intermediate enolate. This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to give the final neutral product.\n    1.  **Attack**: `[-]CH(COOMe)2` attacks the β-carbon (`p-Tolyl-CH-`).\n    2.  **Bond Formation**: A new C-C bond forms between the carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  **Protonation**: The α-carbon gets a proton from the solvent.\n*   **Product (A) Structure**: The structure of the product is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe`.\n*   **Matching with Options**: We need to identify which of the given names corresponds to this structure.\n    *   The options distinguish between two isomers based on the position of the `p-tolyl` group relative to the ester groups on a \"propane-tricarboxylate\" skeleton.\n    *   **Structure from options B/C**: `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate`. Let's analyze the connectivity: `p-tolyl-CH2 - CH(COOMe) - CH(COOMe)2`. This would be the result of the malonate nucleophile attacking the α-carbon of the acrylate, which is not a Michael addition.\n    *   **Structure from options A/D**: `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. Let's analyze the connectivity: `(MeOOC)2CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH2COOMe`. This structure matches the one we derived from the correct Michael addition mechanism (β-attack).\n*   **Conclusion for A**: Product A is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Part 2: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reactants**: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`), followed by acidic workup (MeOH, H3O+).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition using an enamine as the nucleophile (a process often part of the Stork enamine alkylation).\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile)**: The enamine, `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine`, is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. It acts as a neutral, \"pre-formed\" enolate equivalent. The nucleophilic carbon is the one β to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile)**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (`CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n*   **Mechanism**: The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion. The subsequent acidic workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n*   **Product (B) Structure**: The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position. The group added is derived from the Michael acceptor. The `CH3-CH=CH-CN` fragment becomes a `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` substituent. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The systematic name for this product is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n*   **Matching with Options**:\n    *   **Options A/D**: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This matches our derived product, which is in its stable keto form.\n    *   **Options B/C**: `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`. This is the enol tautomer of the product. The keto form is generally more stable and is considered the major final product unless conditions specifically favor the enol.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: Product B is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This is consistent with options A and D.\n\n**Part 3: Analyze Reaction C**\n\n*   **Reactants**: An unknown reactant C + but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Product**: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the donor. We can solve this using retrosynthesis (working backward from the product).\n*   **Retrosynthesis**: The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The parent structure is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The substituent at C2 is `-(CH2)-(CH2)-C(=O)CH3`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   This substituent is derived from the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (`CH2=CH-C(=O)CH3`). The reaction added a proton to the α-carbon and formed a bond at the β-carbon. This matches.\n    *   The C-C bond formed during the reaction is between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of the MVK.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons at C2 of this molecule are exceptionally acidic, as they are located between two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant C Structure**: The Michael donor, reactant C, must therefore be `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The base (KOH) deprotonates it at C2 to generate the nucleophile needed for the reaction.\n*   **Matching with Options**:\n    *   **Option A**: Reactant C is `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This is an incorrect starting material.\n    *   **Option D**: Reactant C is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This is the correct starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for C**: Reactant C is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A corresponds to the name in options A and D.\n*   Product B corresponds to the name in options A and D.\n*   Reactant C corresponds to the name in option D.\n\nTherefore, all three parts are correctly described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
