    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reaction to form product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (let's call it NBD-OtBu) and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction conditions point towards the in-situ generation of a reactive diene, which then participates in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **The Diene Precursor**: The compound `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is a precursor for a reactive diene. Treatment with NaI causes debromination (elimination of 4 Br atoms) to form `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. However, a more common and stable intermediate generated from similar precursors (like 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzenes) is **o-xylylene** (also known as o-quinodimethane). Given the common patterns in organic chemistry problems, it's highly probable that o-xylylene is the intended reactive diene. o-Xylylene has the formula C8H8 and acts as a 4-pi electron system in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **The Dienophile**: NBD-OtBu has two double bonds (at C2-C3 and C5-C6). It is a symmetrical molecule.\n*   **The Reaction**: A Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Since there are 2 equivalents of the diene precursor, two separate Diels-Alder reactions will take place, one at each double bond of the NBD-OtBu dienophile.\n*   **Product 1**: The resulting molecule (Product 1) is a highly symmetrical (C2v symmetry) bis-adduct. It has a central 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core, with two polycyclic systems fused to the (C2, C3) and (C5, C6) positions. The bulky tert-butoxy group on the C7 bridge directs the cycloadditions to the opposite face.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Product 1.\n*   **Reagent**: Aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4, H2O).\n*   **Reaction Type**: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is an acid-labile protecting group for alcohols.\n*   **Product 2**: The tert-butoxy group is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Product 2 is identical to Product 1, but with an -OH group at the C7 position instead of -OtBu. The C2v symmetry of the molecule is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Product 2.\n*   **Reagent**: SO3 and pyridine in DMSO (Sulfur trioxide pyridine complex in dimethyl sulfoxide).\n*   **Reaction Type**: Parikh-Doering oxidation. This is a mild method for oxidizing secondary alcohols to ketones.\n*   **Product 3**: The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a ketone (C=O). Product 3 is the same bis-adduct as before but with a carbonyl group at the C7 bridge. The molecule still retains its C2v symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Product 3.\n*   **Reagent**: Heat (150 °C).\n*   **Reaction Type**: The adducts formed from Diels-Alder reactions are known to undergo a reverse reaction, called a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, upon heating.\n*   **Decomposition**: Product 3 will break down. The two Diels-Alder reactions reverse, yielding back the two molecules of the diene (o-xylylene) and the dienophile core. The core would be **7-norbornadienone**.\n    *   Product 3 → 2 x o-xylylene + 7-norbornadienone\n*   **Further Reaction**: 7-norbornadienone is a known unstable molecule. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction) to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form benzene (C6H6). This fragmentation is very rapid.\n    *   7-norbornadienone → Benzene + CO\n*   **Final Products**: Therefore, heating Product 3 results in a mixture of three substances: Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, and o-xylylene.\n*   **Identifying Product 4**: The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\". This is ambiguous as there are multiple products. In such cases, \"product 4\" often refers to the most complex organic molecule formed, which is o-xylylene. Benzene is a very simple molecule, and CO is inorganic.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (o-Xylylene)**\n\n*   **Structure**: o-Xylylene (or o-quinodimethane) is `1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-3,5-diene`. Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds inside the ring and two exocyclic double bonds on adjacent carbons.\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule has a C2 rotational axis of symmetry which simplifies its 1H NMR spectrum. Let's analyze the equivalence of its 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    Let the structure be C1(=CH2)-C2(=CH2)-C3H=C4H-C5H=C6H-C1. The C2 axis bisects the C1-C2 and C4=C5 bonds.\n    1.  **Ring Hydrogens**:\n        *   The hydrogen on C3 (H3) is equivalent to the hydrogen on C6 (H6) due to the C2 symmetry. This gives one signal.\n        *   The hydrogen on C4 (H4) is equivalent to the hydrogen on C5 (H5). This gives a second signal.\n    2.  **Methylene (=CH2) Hydrogens**:\n        *   On each methylene group, the two hydrogens are not equivalent; they are diastereotopic. Let's call them H_cis and H_trans relative to the adjacent methylene group.\n        *   The H_cis on the first methylene group is equivalent to the H_cis on the second methylene group due to C2 symmetry. This gives a third signal.\n        *   The H_trans on the first methylene group is equivalent to the H_trans on the second methylene group. This gives a fourth signal.\n*   **Conclusion**: In total, there are **4** sets of chemically distinct (non-equivalent) hydrogen atoms in o-xylylene. This means its 1H NMR spectrum would show 4 signals.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
