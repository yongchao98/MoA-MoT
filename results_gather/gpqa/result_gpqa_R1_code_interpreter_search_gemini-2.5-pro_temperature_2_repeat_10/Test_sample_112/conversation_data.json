    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The peak is very broad due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch in this region (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹), the extreme broadness combined with the other peaks points more strongly to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a conjugated carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms that the molecule contains an alkene functional group. This corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most likely candidate is the carboxyl fragment, **[COOH]⁺**.\n    *   Mass = 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45.\n*   This fragment is very characteristic of carboxylic acids upon electron ionization. Its presence provides strong confirmation of the -COOH functional group.\n\n### 4. Synthesis of Evidence and Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation\n\nBased on the combined spectroscopic evidence, we have established that the unknown compound must contain:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene** group (C=C).\n\nThis allows us to screen the given options:\n*   A) C6H10O (One oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n*   B) C6H10O2 (Two oxygens) -> Possible.\n*   C) C6H12O2 (Two oxygens) -> Possible.\n*   D) C6H12O (One oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n\nNow we must decide between B and C. We can do this by calculating the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**, which tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1  (for formulas containing only C, H, and O)\n\nOur molecule has a C=C double bond (1 DoU) and a C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid (1 DoU).\nTherefore, the **required DoU is 1 + 1 = 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This does not match. A compound with this formula could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid, which has one C=O) but cannot also have a C=C double bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C6H10O2** is consistent with all the analytical data. It accounts for the two oxygen atoms of a carboxylic acid and has the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to include both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
