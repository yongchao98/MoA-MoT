    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   Integration (3H) suggests a methyl group (CH3).\n        *   Multiplicity (s, singlet) means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n        *   Chemical shift (~2.1 ppm) is characteristic of the methyl group of an acetate ester (`-O-C(=O)-CH3`).\n        *   This strongly suggests the molecule is an acetate ester. All four options are acetate esters, so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm:**\n        *   These three signals must describe the \"alkyl\" part of the ester (the propenyl or butenyl group).\n        *   The total number of protons from the data is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n        *   Let's check the number of protons in the proposed structures:\n            *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** CH3(3H) + CH(1H) + CH(1H) + OCOCH3(3H) = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n            *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** e.g., 2-butenyl acetate has 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n        *   Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Propenyl Acetate (`CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`):**\n        *   Let's analyze the remaining signals for the propenyl group (`CH3-CH=CH-`).\n        *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group (`CH3-`) attached to the double bond. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (`-CH=`). This is a correct assignment.\n        *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton (`-CH=`) that is adjacent to the methyl group. It is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This is a correct assignment.\n        *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton (`=CH-`) attached directly to the electronegative oxygen atom. This explains its high chemical shift (deshielding). It is split into a doublet (d) because it is only coupled to the other vinyl proton. This is a correct assignment.\n\n*   **Determining Cis vs. Trans Stereochemistry:**\n\n    *   The stereochemistry (cis or trans) of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons (`-CH=CH-`).\n    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A **trans** arrangement leads to a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement leads to a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this is characteristic of a **trans** double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   The compound has an acetate group and a propenyl group, ruling out butenyl acetates.\n    *   The coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons confirms a trans configuration for the double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
