    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem `a` and an infinitely large number of sides `N` approaches a circle of radius `r = a`. Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ 2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, with `λ` being the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n\nThe dark rings in the diffraction pattern, or the intensity minima, occur at the angles `θ` for which the numerator is zero, i.e., `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`. This condition holds true when the argument of the Bessel function, `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, is equal to one of the non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\nThe condition for the minima becomes:\n`J₁( (2πa/λ) * θ ) = 0`\n\nLet `x_m` be the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The angular position of the m-th minimum, `θ_m`, is given by:\n(2πa/λ) * θ_m = x_m\nθ_m = (λ / (2πa)) * x_m\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`. These are well-known values:\n*   First root, `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second root, `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   The angular position of the first minimum is `θ₁`:\n    θ₁ = (λ / (2πa)) * x₁ ≈ (λ / (2πa)) * 3.8317 ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n\n*   The angular position of the second minimum is `θ₂`:\n    θ₂ = (λ / (2πa)) * x₂ ≈ (λ / (2πa)) * 7.0156 ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between `θ₂` and `θ₁`:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a (This corresponds to the angular diameter of the central bright spot, `2θ₁`)\n\nThe calculated value `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)` is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
