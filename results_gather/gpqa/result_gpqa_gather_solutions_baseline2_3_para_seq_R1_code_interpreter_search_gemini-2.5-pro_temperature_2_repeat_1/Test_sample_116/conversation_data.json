Define the Core Principle: Optical Isomerism**\n\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The two most common structural features that lead to chirality are:\n*   **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a bond, which creates a stable, non-planar molecule lacking symmetry. A common example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls.\n\nConversely, a molecule is achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (the *ortho* positions) are all occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The steric hindrance from these groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, called **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar shape. This shape lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** We must examine the carbon atoms for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2. A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3. A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4. A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. There are no chiral centers. The molecule is symmetrical and possesses a plane of symmetry that can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.

This is likely due to inconsistencies in how the multiple-choice options were lettered for each agent. The core analysis, which is the most valuable part of their response, is sound and consistent.\n\n**4.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon the original structure. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center or certain types of molecular asymmetry like axial chirality. Conversely, the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral (not chiral).\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structural Analysis:** This is a biphenyl compound, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single bond. It has four large, bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) located on the *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), which are the positions immediately adjacent to the bond connecting the rings.\n    *   **Chirality Assessment:** The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** This twisted structure does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality and therefore **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structural Analysis:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The question of chirality centers on the carbon atom at position 2.\n    *   **Chirality Assessment:** We examine the four groups attached to the carbon at position 2:\n        1.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon the original. The key to determining chirality is to look for the absence of certain symmetry elements, primarily a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). Common structural features that lead to chirality include:\n*   **Chiral Centers:** An atom (typically carbon) bonded to four different substituent groups.\n*   **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation about an axis, such as in certain substituted biphenyls (a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Compound\nLet's analyze each compound for the presence of chirality-inducing features and the absence of symmetry elements.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule with large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance from these ortho-substituents prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond connecting them. This restricted rotation, or atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This twisted structure does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound (also known as methyl lactate) has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** We must examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2. A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3. A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4. A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Because this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅.\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has no chiral centers. More importantly, it is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond and bisect the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated ester, with the structure *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond. A molecule possessing either of these symmetry elements is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Conclude\nBased on the analysis above:\n*   Compound **1** is optically active.\n*   Compound **2** is optically active.\n*   Compound **3** is not optically active.\n*   Compound **4** is not optically active.\n\nThe correct answer must therefore be the option that includes compounds 1 and 2.

There is a unanimous consensus on the scientific facts.\n*   The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers (A, B, C, D) stem from inconsistent labeling of the options in the source material they were given, not from flawed logic.\n*   The unwavering consensus on the chemical reasoning provides a very high degree of confidence that compounds 1 and 2 are the only correct answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Concept of Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most reliable way to check for chirality is to look for the absence of specific symmetry elements, namely:\n*   A **plane of symmetry (σ)**: An imaginary plane that bisects the molecule into two identical halves.\n*   A **center of inversion (i)**: A central point in the molecule from which any atom can be reflected through the point to an identical atom on the opposite side.\n\nThe presence of either of these symmetry elements makes a molecule **achiral** and thus incapable of showing optical isomerism. The most common structural features that lead to chirality are a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Individually**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature is the presence of four large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at the *ortho*-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups clash with each other, which severely restricts the rotation around the single C-C bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Key Point:** This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. It forces the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine chirality, we look for a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Key Point:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the C-2 atom is a chiral center, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. This molecule is symmetrical.\n*   **Key Point:** It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Key Point:** The molecule is planar. As such, the molecular plane is itself a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, the molecule is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Select the Correct Option**\n\n*   Compound **1** is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **2** is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **3** is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **4** is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the only compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. We now match this conclusion to the given options:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe correct option is D, as it includes both compound 1 and compound 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nA step-by-step analysis is performed to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

Analysis of Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Key Feature:** This is a biphenyl molecule with large, bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') relative to the bond connecting the two rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The severe steric hindrance between these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. The molecule is locked into a stable, twisted conformation that is not planar.\n*   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.

The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the nature of the double bond. A planar molecule by definition has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself).

Looking at the specific options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) 1 and 2**\n*   B) 3 and 4\n*   C) 1, 2 and 4\n*   D) 2 and 3\n\nThe correct choice is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic analysis of each compound is required, drawing upon the core principles of stereochemistry and referencing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Core Concept: Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The absence of key symmetry elements—specifically a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i)—is the defining characteristic of a chiral molecule. Common structural features leading to chirality are:\n*   A **chiral center**: An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different substituents.\n*   **Axial chirality**: Chirality arising from restricted rotation about an axis, a classic example being atropisomerism in certain substituted biphenyls.\n\n**2. Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** A biphenyl system where all four *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The severe steric hindrance between these four large groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**. This analysis is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃ (also known as methyl lactate).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The carbon atom at position 2 is a **chiral center**. It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1. Hydrogen (-H)\n        2. Hydroxyl (-OH)\n        3. Methyl (-CH₃)\n        4. Methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center renders the entire molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**. This analysis is also unanimously supported by the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. It **does not show optical isomerism**. This is a point of complete agreement among all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The molecule is planar. Due to its high symmetry, it has both a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**. Again, all candidate answers concur on this point.\n\n### Careful Points and Synthesis\n\n*   **Consensus:** There is a complete and correct consensus in the scientific reasoning of all 15 candidate answers. All of them correctly conclude that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral (optically active), while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral (not optically active).\n*   **Discrepancy in Letter Choice:** The candidate answers often select different final letters (A, B, C, D). This indicates that the multiple-choice options they were presented with may have been ordered differently. This is a superficial error. The crucial part is that the underlying chemical analysis consistently and unanimously points to the same set of compounds.\n*   **Final Decision:** The correct answer must be the option that includes compounds 1 and 2 only. According to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 1, 2 and 4\n    B) 2 and 3\n    C) 3 and 4\n    D) 1 and 2\n\nThe conclusion that only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct answer, a careful step-by-step analysis of each compound is required to ascertain whether it exhibits optical isomerism. This analysis is supported by the unanimous reasoning presented across all 15 candidate answers.\n\n**The core principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This means the molecule must lack key symmetry elements, specifically a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis for each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large, bulky groups (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups). The significant steric hindrance from these groups prevents the rings from rotating freely around the bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral.\n*   **Result:** **Shows optical isomerism.**\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis:** To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different chemical groups. The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Result:** **Shows optical isomerism.**\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical. It has no chiral centers. Crucially, it possesses a plane of symmetry that can be drawn through the C=O bond, bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Result:** **Does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** As a planar molecule, it has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). It also has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Result:** **Does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe analysis, which is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all provided candidate answers, confirms that:\n*   Compound **1** shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **2** shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **3** does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **4** does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. According to the list of options provided:\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the final answer, a comprehensive analysis of each compound is necessary. The analysis will be guided by the fundamental principles of stereochemistry and will cross-reference the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**Core Concept: Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key factors to identify chirality include:\n1.  **Presence of a Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four distinct groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation about a single bond, commonly seen in hindered biphenyls.\n3.  **Absence of Symmetry Elements:** A chiral molecule must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. If either of these is present, the molecule is achiral.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. All four positions ortho to the bond connecting the two phenyl rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance from these groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.

It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Candidate Consensus:** All provided answers correctly identify this compound as achiral.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate, *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar due to the nature of the carbon-carbon double bond. This geometry results in two key symmetry elements:\n    1.

Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key methods for determining chirality are:\n*   **Checking for Chiral Centers:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. A molecule with one chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Checking for Chirality without Chiral Centers:** Some molecules, like certain substituted biphenyls, can be chiral due to restricted rotation around a single bond. This is known as axial chirality or atropisomerism.\n*   **Checking for Symmetry Elements:** A molecule is **achiral** (and thus not optically active) if it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Based on the Principle**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule with large groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four positions ortho to the bond connecting the two phenyl rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, called **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** We inspect the carbon at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  Hydrogen (-H)\n        2.  Hydroxyl (-OH)\n        3.  Methyl (-CH₃)\n        4.  Methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:**\n    *   **Structure:** C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has no chiral centers. Crucially, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be drawn through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Furthermore, this specific molecule has a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Either of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Select the Correct Option**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **1** shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **2** shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **3** does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **4** does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice must be the one that includes compounds 1 and 2. Reviewing the options:\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n**Step 4: Careful Points from Candidate Answer Analysis**\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers provide the exact same correct reasoning for all four compounds, concluding that 1 and 2 are chiral while 3 and 4 are achiral.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Answer:** Despite the unanimous reasoning, the final letter chosen by the candidates varies. This suggests errors in matching their correct conclusion (\"1 and 2 are the answer\") to the corresponding letter option, or they were working from a scrambled list of options.\n*   **Final Decision Strategy:** The decision should be based on the strength and unanimity of the scientific reasoning provided, not on the potentially erroneous final letter selection. The reasoning across all candidates strongly and exclusively supports \"1 and 2\".\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n**1.

A compound will show optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key ways to assess chirality are:\n*   **Absence of Symmetry:** A chiral molecule must not have a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   **Sources of Chirality:** Chirality often arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from a fixed, twisted molecular geometry (axial chirality, e.g., atropisomerism).\n\n**2. Systematically Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are bulky (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). Their size causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. The molecule does not have any chiral centers. More importantly, it is highly symmetrical. A plane of symmetry can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Due to the double bond, the molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Results and Evaluate the Candidate Answers**\n\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Does NOT show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Does NOT show optical isomerism.\n\nThe correct answer must be the choice that includes only compounds 1 and 2.

Crucially, all four positions next to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large, bulky groups (—NO₂ and —COOCH₃). The sheer size of these groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. It forces the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that is non-planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **chiral** due to axial chirality and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃—CH(OH)—COOCH₃.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. This property is confirmed by the absence of specific symmetry elements, namely a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). The most common causes of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or a fixed molecular asymmetry like axial chirality.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\nA consistent analysis across all candidate answers provides a clear breakdown for each compound.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl molecule.

The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon the original. The key to determining chirality is to look for the absence of certain symmetry elements, primarily a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). Common structural features that lead to chirality include:\n*   **Chiral Centers:** An atom (typically carbon) bonded to four different substituent groups.\n*   **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation about an axis, such as in certain substituted biphenyls (a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Compound\nLet's analyze each compound for the presence of chirality-inducing features and the absence of symmetry elements.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule with large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance from these ortho-substituents prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond connecting them. This restricted rotation, or atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This twisted structure does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound (also known as methyl lactate) has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** We must examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2. A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3. A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4. A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Because this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅.\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has no chiral centers. More importantly, it is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond and bisect the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated ester, with the structure *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond. A molecule possessing either of these symmetry elements is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Conclude\nBased on the analysis above:\n*   Compound **1** is optically active.\n*   Compound **2** is optically active.\n*   Compound **3** is not optically active.\n*   Compound **4** is not optically active.\n\nThe correct answer must therefore be the option that includes compounds 1 and 2.

There is a unanimous consensus on the scientific facts.\n*   The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers (A, B, C, D) stem from inconsistent labeling of the options in the source material they were given, not from flawed logic.\n*   The unwavering consensus on the chemical reasoning provides a very high degree of confidence that compounds 1 and 2 are the only correct answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Concept of Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most reliable way to check for chirality is to look for the absence of specific symmetry elements, namely:\n*   A **plane of symmetry (σ)**: An imaginary plane that bisects the molecule into two identical halves.\n*   A **center of inversion (i)**: A central point in the molecule from which any atom can be reflected through the point to an identical atom on the opposite side.\n\nThe presence of either of these symmetry elements makes a molecule **achiral** and thus incapable of showing optical isomerism. The most common structural features that lead to chirality are a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Individually**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature is the presence of four large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at the *ortho*-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups clash with each other, which severely restricts the rotation around the single C-C bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Key Point:** This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. It forces the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine chirality, we look for a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Key Point:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the C-2 atom is a chiral center, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. This molecule is symmetrical.\n*   **Key Point:** It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Key Point:** The molecule is planar. As such, the molecular plane is itself a plane of symmetry.

A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning its mirror image is non-superimposable. This analysis will focus on identifying features of chirality (like chiral centers or axial chirality) or elements of symmetry (like planes or centers of inversion) that make a molecule achiral.\n\n**1. Analysis of Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Key Feature:** This is a biphenyl molecule with large, bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') relative to the bond connecting the two rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The severe steric hindrance between these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. The molecule is locked into a stable, twisted conformation that is not planar.\n*   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analysis of Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Key Feature:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The main point to check is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n*   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2. A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3. A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4. A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Analysis of Compound 3: benzophenone**\n*   **Key Feature:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule is symmetrical.\n*   **Analysis:** Benzophenone does not have any chiral centers. More importantly, it possesses a plane of symmetry that can be drawn through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. Analysis of Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Key Feature:** \"Fumarate\" indicates the *trans*-isomer of the ester. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the nature of the double bond. A planar molecule by definition has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Additionally, this specific structure possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound **1** is chiral (due to atropisomerism).\n*   Compound **2** is chiral (due to a chiral center).\n*   Compound **3** is achiral.\n*   Compound **4** is achiral.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

Understand the Core Scientific Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the four listed compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks key symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. We will analyze each compound for these properties.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a [1,1'-biphenyl] system. The positions immediately adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large, bulky groups: two nitro (-NO₂) groups and two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups.\n    *   **Analysis of Chirality:** These bulky substituents sterically hinder each other, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central C-C single bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality. **It shows optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester, CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃, also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Analysis of Chirality:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon atom at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to a stereocenter. **It shows optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** A ketone with two phenyl rings attached to a carbonyl carbon, (C₆H₅)₂CO.\n    *   **Analysis of Chirality:** The molecule does not have a chiral center. More importantly, it possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the C=O bond and bisect the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral. **It does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Analysis of Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). It also has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements renders a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral. **It does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n**3. Synthesize the Results and Evaluate the Candidate Answers**\n\nThe chemical analysis correctly concludes that compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nThe reasoning provided in all 15 candidate answers is entirely consistent with this analysis. Every candidate correctly identifies that 1 and 2 are chiral (for the right reasons) and that 3 and 4 are achiral (for the right reasons). This indicates a strong consensus on the scientific facts.\n\n**4. Determine the Final Answer**\n\nThe task is to select the option that correctly lists the compounds showing optical isomerism.

Core Concept: Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The absence of key symmetry elements—specifically a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i)—is the defining characteristic of a chiral molecule. Common structural features leading to chirality are:\n*   A **chiral center**: An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different substituents.\n*   **Axial chirality**: Chirality arising from restricted rotation about an axis, a classic example being atropisomerism in certain substituted biphenyls.\n\n**2. Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** A biphenyl system where all four *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The severe steric hindrance between these four large groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**. This analysis is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃ (also known as methyl lactate).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The carbon atom at position 2 is a **chiral center**. It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1. Hydrogen (-H)\n        2. Hydroxyl (-OH)\n        3. Methyl (-CH₃)\n        4. Methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center renders the entire molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**. This analysis is also unanimously supported by the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. It **does not show optical isomerism**. This is a point of complete agreement among all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The molecule is planar. Due to its high symmetry, it has both a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**. Again, all candidate answers concur on this point.\n\n### Careful Points and Synthesis\n\n*   **Consensus:** There is a complete and correct consensus in the scientific reasoning of all 15 candidate answers. All of them correctly conclude that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral (optically active), while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral (not optically active).\n*   **Discrepancy in Letter Choice:** The candidate answers often select different final letters (A, B, C, D). This indicates that the multiple-choice options they were presented with may have been ordered differently. This is a superficial error. The crucial part is that the underlying chemical analysis consistently and unanimously points to the same set of compounds.\n*   **Final Decision:** The correct answer must be the option that includes compounds 1 and 2 only. According to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 1, 2 and 4\n    B) 2 and 3\n    C) 3 and 4\n    D) 1 and 2\n\nThe conclusion that only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct answer, a careful step-by-step analysis of each compound is required to ascertain whether it exhibits optical isomerism. This analysis is supported by the unanimous reasoning presented across all 15 candidate answers.\n\n**The core principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This means the molecule must lack key symmetry elements, specifically a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis for each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large, bulky groups (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups). The significant steric hindrance from these groups prevents the rings from rotating freely around the bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral.\n*   **Result:** **Shows optical isomerism.**\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis:** To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different chemical groups.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Result:** **Shows optical isomerism.**\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical. It has no chiral centers. Crucially, it possesses a plane of symmetry that can be drawn through the C=O bond, bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Result:** **Does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** As a planar molecule, it has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). It also has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Result:** **Does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe analysis, which is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all provided candidate answers, confirms that:\n*   Compound **1** shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **2** shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **3** does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **4** does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key factors to identify chirality include:\n1.  **Presence of a Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four distinct groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation about a single bond, commonly seen in hindered biphenyls.\n3.  **Absence of Symmetry Elements:** A chiral molecule must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.

Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key methods for determining chirality are:\n*   **Checking for Chiral Centers:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. A molecule with one chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Checking for Chirality without Chiral Centers:** Some molecules, like certain substituted biphenyls, can be chiral due to restricted rotation around a single bond. This is known as axial chirality or atropisomerism.\n*   **Checking for Symmetry Elements:** A molecule is **achiral** (and thus not optically active) if it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Based on the Principle**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule with large groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four positions ortho to the bond connecting the two phenyl rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, called **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** We inspect the carbon at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group).

Crucially, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be drawn through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond.

The key ways to assess chirality are:\n*   **Absence of Symmetry:** A chiral molecule must not have a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   **Sources of Chirality:** Chirality often arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from a fixed, twisted molecular geometry (axial chirality, e.g., atropisomerism).\n\n**2. Systematically Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are bulky (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). Their size causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. The molecule does not have any chiral centers. More importantly, it is highly symmetrical. A plane of symmetry can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Due to the double bond, the molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Results and Evaluate the Candidate Answers**\n\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Does NOT show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Does NOT show optical isomerism.\n\nThe correct answer must be the choice that includes only compounds 1 and 2. All 15 candidate answers show a perfect consensus on this reasoning, even though their final letter choices differ (likely due to shuffled options in the prompts they received). The unanimity in the scientific analysis is the most reliable signal.\n\n**4. Select the Final Answer**\nThe conclusion is that compounds **1 and 2** are the correct answers. We now match this to the provided list of options:\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the final answer, a careful step-by-step analysis of each compound is required. The core of the question is to identify which molecules are chiral, as these are the ones that exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks key symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Molecular Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound, meaning it has two phenyl rings joined by a single bond.\n*   **Key Feature:** All four positions *ortho* to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance caused by these bulky groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality. **It shows optical isomerism.**\n\n**2. Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Key Feature:** We check for the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. **It shows optical isomerism.**\n\n**3. Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** This molecule is symmetrical. It has no chiral centers. More importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral. **It does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n**4. Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Molecular Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This means the molecular plane itself is a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, it has a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral. **It does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   Compound **1** shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **2** shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **3** does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound **4** does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer includes only compounds 1 and 2. Matching this conclusion to the given options:\n\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the reasoning in all the provided candidate answers is unanimously correct and leads to the conclusion that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active, their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent. This is likely because they were evaluating against different option labelings. The decision here is based purely on the correct chemical analysis applied to the options provided in the question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Scientific Principle**\n\nThe core of the question is to identify which of the given compounds are **chiral**. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. The primary methods to assess this are:\n*   **Look for symmetry elements:** If a molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (a plane that divides the molecule into two identical halves) or a center of inversion (a point through which every atom can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side), it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n*   **Look for sources of chirality:**\n    *   **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four distinct groups.\n    *   **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality that arises from restricted rotation around a single bond, often seen in heavily substituted biphenyls.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a biphenyl compound where the two phenyl rings are linked by a single bond. Crucially, all four positions next to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large, bulky groups (—NO₂ and —COOCH₃). The sheer size of these groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. It forces the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that is non-planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **chiral** due to axial chirality and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃—CH(OH)—COOCH₃. We check for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a **chiral center**. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅—CO—C₆H₅. There are no chiral centers.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** This molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be imagined slicing through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid (CH₃OOC—CH=CH—COOCH₃). The molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** It has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** (the point at the center of the C=C double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Final Answer**\n\n*   Compound 1 shows optical isomerism (Yes).\n*   Compound 2 shows optical isomerism (Yes).\n*   Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism (No).\n*   Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism (No).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the option that includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n**4.
