Analysis of the Chemical Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene. The reaction sequence (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺) performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation. A fundamental rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single **meso** compound. Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is one achiral compound.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene. The same *anti*-dihydroxylation is performed. The corresponding stereochemical rule states that an *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a 1:1 mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nWhen the products are combined, the final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol**\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are key: The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Chromatographic Separation**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso compound will elute as a **separate peak** from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the separation of molecules based on their 3D shape.\n    *   The chiral column can separate the **enantiomers** into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the others) as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis unequivocally concludes that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. Reviewing the options:\n\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nThe conclusion matches option B perfectly.

The two-step sequence of epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the net *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single **meso compound**. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a symmetrical *cis*-alkene) undergoes the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two chiral, enantiomeric products: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   **Contents:** The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Relationships:** The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) molecules are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso molecule is a **diastereomer** of both of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity) in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be separated. They will elute together, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **will** be separated. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the meso compound from the others (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   Crucially, it will also separate the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) from each other.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll the candidate agents correctly reasoned that the experiment would result in **2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**. The discrepancies in their final answers arose from incorrectly matching this conclusion to the lettered options.\n\nMatching our confirmed result to the given options:\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions, followed by an understanding of how the resulting product mixture is separated by both standard (achiral) and chiral chromatography.

Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:** The treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) followed by aqueous acid is a standard procedure for *anti*-dihydroxylation. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one on each face.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry dictates that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single **meso compound**. A meso compound contains stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces one compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:** This is the same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are key:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, shape) in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will co-elute and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a **second, distinct peak**.\n    *   **Result:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to distinguish between and separate enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all three unique stereoisomers. It will separate the meso-diol from the other two (as they are diastereomers). Critically, it will also separate the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) from each other.\n    *   **Result:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis concludes that the chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard (achiral) HPLC column and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC column.

They cannot be separated and will elute together, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are readily separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with each stereoisomer, enabling their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two **enantiomers**—(4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol—into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will have its own unique retention time, appearing as a third peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC.

A key rule in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single, achiral **meso compound**. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces one product: meso-octane-4,5-diol.

Analysis of the Chemical Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene. The reaction sequence (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺) performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation. A fundamental rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single **meso** compound. Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is one achiral compound.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene. The same *anti*-dihydroxylation is performed. The corresponding stereochemical rule states that an *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a 1:1 mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nWhen the products are combined, the final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol**\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are key: The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.

Analysis of the Chromatographic Separation**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso compound will elute as a **separate peak** from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the separation of molecules based on their 3D shape.\n    *   The chiral column can separate the **enantiomers** into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the others) as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis unequivocally concludes that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.

A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to internal symmetry.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Products**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene, also symmetrical.\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that an *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Combined Product Mixture Analysis**\n    *   The final mixture contains three unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   The stereochemical relationships are critical: The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) molecules are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both enantiomers.\n\n4.  **Chromatography Prediction**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase which creates a chiral environment.\n        *   The chiral column can separate enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral phase, forming temporary diastereomeric complexes with different stabilities. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will resolve into two separate peaks.\n        *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be resolved and have its own unique retention time.\n        *   **Result:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning is unanimous and robust across all candidate answers: the final mixture will show **2 peaks on a standard (achiral) HPLC column** and **3 peaks on a chiral HPLC column**.\n\nMatching this outcome to the given options:\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
