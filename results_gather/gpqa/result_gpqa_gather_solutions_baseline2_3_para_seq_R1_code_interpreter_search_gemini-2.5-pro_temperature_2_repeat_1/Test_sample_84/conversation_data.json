The primary source of confusion among the agents appears to be the lettering of the multiple-choice options, not the physics or the calculation itself.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task**: The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature, `T_eq`, of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\n    For two planets orbiting the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and with the same albedo (`A` is constant), the ratio simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This initial step is correctly identified by all agents who showed their reasoning, establishing a strong consensus on the basic physics. The problem is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance (`a`) to Radial Velocity (`K`)**: The semi-major axis (`a`) can be found from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via transits (inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(`i`) ≈ 1), the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on the star is related to its mass (`M_p`) and semi-major axis (`a`) by:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n    Rearranging to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a₂/a₁`)**: Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can form the ratio of the semi-major axes. The proportionality constants cancel out.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n    This derivation is also correctly performed by nearly all agents.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We can now substitute the expression for `a₂/a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    The square root and the squares cancel, yielding a simple final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (`K₁/K₂`) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ₁/Δλ₂`). Plugging in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Numerical Result and Conclusion**: Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    This numerical result is consistently derived across almost all candidate answers, demonstrating a very high degree of confidence in the calculation. The final step is to match this value to the options provided in the problem description:\n\n    A) ~ 0.53\n    B) ~ 1.30\n    C) ~ 1.05\n    D) ~ 0.98\n\n    The calculated value of ~0.5357 is unambiguously closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided agents' responses.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal and Relevant Physics\nThe main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n### 2. Simplify the Temperature Ratio\nWe are asked for the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are the same for both and cancel out in the ratio. This is a critical first step, noted by almost all the agents.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplification reveals that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes. Note that the star's temperature, radius, and mass, as well as the planets' radii, are ultimately not needed for this calculation.\n\n### 3. Relate Orbital Distance to Observation Data\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) must be related to the given radial velocity (RV) data (Doppler shift). The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n**Careful Point**: The problem states the planets were detected by the transit method. This means their orbits are seen edge-on, so the inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{a} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n### 4. Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nUsing the proportionality above, we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality (containing $G$ and $M_{star}$) cancel out.\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n### 5. Combine Ratios and Use Doppler Shift Data\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel, leaving the final expression:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of velocities $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\n### 6. Perform the Final Calculation\nPlug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### 7. Match to Options\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.536. We compare this to the options provided in the prompt:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to 0.53. The vast majority of the candidate agents correctly performed this calculation, though some made errors in selecting the final letter, likely due to receiving a different or shuffled list of options. Based on a consistent and correct physical derivation, the numerical answer is ~0.536.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The core task is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, which can be expressed as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    When we form the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$, terms that are identical for both planets cancel out. The problem states that they orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo (so $A$ is the same). This leaves a simplified relationship:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This crucial first step shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes. All the provided candidate answers correctly identify this relationship.\n\n3.  **Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**: The next step is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$) using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star is approximately:\n    $K \\approx M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n    (The term $\\sin(i)$ is approximately 1 because the planets were detected by the transit method, implying their orbits are edge-on).\n\n    Rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a` gives:\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**: We can now form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants, the Gravitational Constant ($G$) and the mass of the star ($M_{star}$), are the same for both and cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Again, there is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on this derivation.\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Substitute Knowns**: Now, we substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other, yielding the final, simplified expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: We can now plug in the numerical values provided in the question:\n    *   Ratio of planet masses: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Ratio of Doppler shifts: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    Plugging these ratios into the final equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n7.  **Final Numerical Result**:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this result with the options provided in the original question:\n    A) ~ 0.98\n    B) ~ 1.30\n    C) ~ 0.53\n    D) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to 0.53. The candidate answers show that while nearly all agents correctly performed the calculation, they were presented with different ordering of the options, leading to discrepancies in the final letter choice.

Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out from the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets. The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed for the final calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\n\nThe semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) that a planet induces on its star is given for a circular orbit by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, meaning their inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{a M_{star}} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. The constants $G$, $M_{star}$, and the $\\sin^2(i)$ term (which is ~1 for both) cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 3: Combine Ratios and Perform the Final Calculation\n\nSubstitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ from Step 2 into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leaving a simple relationship:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of velocities $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculated ratio is ~0.5357.

Note that the specific values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not required for this calculation.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit (which is assumed) is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}}$ (where terms other than M_p and a are constant for a given system)\n\nSince both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbital inclinations ($i$) are approximately 90°, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{a} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out.\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 4: Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root cancels out the squares, yielding the final, simplified relationship:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$.

Here is the synthesized, step-by-step derivation of the correct answer.\n\n**1. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $a$ is the orbital semi-major axis, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the temperatures for Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$), we can divide their respective equations. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances. All candidate answers correctly identified this simplification.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe next step is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$) using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star is given by the following relation for a circular orbit where the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_{star}$):\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}}\\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination.

The agents overwhelmingly agree on the methodology, even if they disagree on the final letter choice due to different option listings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on its distance from the star ($a$). The specific formula is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    When calculating the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) with the same albedo ($A$), all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This is the first critical step, and it is correctly identified by almost all the provided answers. The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**: The RV method provides the necessary data. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) caused by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}} $$\n    Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits are seen edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $$ a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2} $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: We can now form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ are the same for both planets and cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2 $$\n\n4.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Calculation**: Substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other, leaving a simple final expression:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right) $$\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n5.  **Plug in the Given Values**:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 M_Earth\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 M_Earth\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n\n6.  **Convert to a Decimal and Select the Answer**:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n    Comparing this calculated value to the options provided in the prompt:\n    A) ~ 0.98\n    B) ~ 1.05\n    C) ~ 1.30\n    D) ~ 0.53\n\n    The result `0.5357` is unambiguously closest to `0.53`.\n\n### Key Points and Summary\n*   **Consensus:** The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the physical principles and the final numerical calculation (15/28 ≈ 0.536).\n*   **Irrelevant Data:** The problem includes extra information (stellar radius, mass, temperature; planetary radii) which is not needed for the ratio calculation, as these terms cancel out. This is a common feature in physics problems to test understanding of the underlying principles.\n*   **Source of Error in Candidates:** The main discrepancy in the candidate answers is the final letter choice. This is due to the agents being presented with different or scrambled lists of options. The correct procedure is to perform the calculation and then match the result to the specific list of options given in the current problem description.\n*   **Conclusion:** The physics and the math both point to a ratio of approximately 0.536, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate agents.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Goal and Relevant Information\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nThe key pieces of information are:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo.\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 M_Earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 M_Earth\n*   Maximum Doppler shift from Planet 1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Maximum Doppler shift from Planet 2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n*   The other data points (star's mass, radius, temperature; planets' radii) are not needed for this ratio calculation, as they cancel out.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhen forming the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$, terms that are identical for both planets cancel out. Since they orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), the equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\nThis shows that the temperature ratio is dependent on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes). This step is consistently and correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data\nThe problem now is to find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the transit method (where inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), the semi-major axis ($a$) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the RV semi-amplitude it induces on the star ($K$) by the following proportionality:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\nUsing this relationship, we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\nThis derivation is also a point of consensus among the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Formulas and Substitute Data\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ from Step 3 into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel, leaving a simple final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nPlug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Step 6: Match Result to Options\nThe calculated numerical value is approximately **0.536**. Reviewing the options provided in the original question:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value of 0.536 is closest to 0.53, which corresponds to option C. The inconsistencies in the chosen letters among the candidate answers are due to them having differently ordered option lists. Based on the initial problem statement's list, C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a multi-step physics problem that requires combining formulas for planetary equilibrium temperature and stellar radial velocity. After a careful analysis of the reasoning provided by the candidate answers, a single correct pathway emerges, though some agents stumble on matching their final number to the correct letter option.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance ($a$) and albedo ($A$):\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\n    When we create the ratio for the two planets, all the terms related to the star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and the identical albedo ($A$) cancel out, leaving a much simpler expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This shows the temperature ratio is dependent only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes). The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides the data needed to find the ratio of the semi-major axes. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$), which is the maximum speed of the star's wobble, is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$) by the following formula (for a circular orbit and a system where the planet is transiting, so sin(i)≈1):\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}}$\n\n    Rearranging to solve for `a`:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n    Now, we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants `G` and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas and Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other out, yielding the final, simplified equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), so their ratios are equal: $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. Now we can plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.30\n    B) ~ 0.98\n    C) ~ 0.53\n    D) ~ 1.05\n\n    The calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    When we create the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, several terms cancel out because both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants for the ratio) and they have the same albedo (`A`). This leaves a simplified relationship that depends only on the semi-major axes (`a`) of their orbits:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data:**\n    The problem is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`. This can be found using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via transit (implying inclination i ≈ 90°), the star's RV semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and its semi-major axis (`a`) by the following proportionality:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    Rearranging to solve for `a`, we get:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\n    Using the proportionality above, we can form the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    Now substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other out, which gives a simple final expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Use Given Data for the Calculation:**\n    The problem gives us the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) rather than the RV semi-amplitudes (`K`). Since `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ`, the ratio `K1 / K2` is the same as the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`. We can now plug in the numbers from the problem statement:\n    *   Mass ratio: $M_{p2} / M_{p1} = 5 M_{Earth} / 7 M_{Earth} = 5/7$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4$\n\n    Substituting these values into the final equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n7.  **Final Result and Conclusion:**\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $15 / 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    The question's options are:\n    A) ~ 0.98\n    B) ~ 1.30\n    C) ~ 1.05\n    D) ~ 0.53\n\n    The calculated value `0.5357` is closest to `0.53`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Many of the provided details (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) are extraneous and not needed to solve the problem, as they cancel out in the ratio.\n*   The relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance is $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$.\n*   The relationship between RV semi-amplitude, planet mass, and orbital distance leads to $a \\propto M_p^2 / K^2$.\n*   Combining these relationships results in a simple final equation where the square roots cancel: $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2} = (M_{p2}/M_{p1}) \\times (K_1/K_2)$. This avoids having to calculate intermediate values for `a`.\n*   All candidate answers correctly derived the physics and arrived at the same numerical answer (`~0.536`), confirming the calculation is robust.

Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core task is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), orbiting the same star.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Derivation (Consensus Method)**\n\nA vast majority of the provided answers follow the same correct physical reasoning. I will consolidate that reasoning here.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio.**\n    The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    For two planets orbiting the same star (same T_star, R_star) and with the same albedo (A), the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes, `a`).\n\n*   **Step 2b: Relate Orbital Distance to Observation Data.**\n    The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (`K`) that a planet of mass `M_p` induces on its star is related to the semi-major axis `a`. For a circular orbit viewed edge-on (since it's a transiting system), the relationship can be shown to be:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n*   **Step 2c: Combine the Ratios.**\n    Substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel, leaving a simple, elegant formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n*   **Step 2d: Use the Given Values.**\n    The problem gives us the Doppler shift in wavelength (`Δλ`), which is directly proportional to the radial velocity `K`. Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n    *   Mass Ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$): 5 / 7\n    *   Doppler Shift Ratio ($Δλ₁/Δλ₂$): 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n    Plug these values into the final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**3.

These terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out, simplifying the ratio significantly to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n### **3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe semi-major axis can be determined from the radial velocity data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) that the planet induces on its star is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{1/2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ = Planet's mass\n*   $M_{star}$ = Star's mass\n*   $i$ = Orbital inclination\n*   $G$ = Gravitational constant\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits are seen nearly edge-on, which means the inclination $i$ is approximately 90° for both planets, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n$K^2 \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{a} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can create the ratio for $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### **5. Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leading to a very simple final expression:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nFinally, we plug in the values given in the problem:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift from Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift from Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n### **6. Final Numerical Result**\n\nTo find the final answer, we convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the method of calculation, even though the final letter choice varies due to differences in the provided option lists.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature, `T_eq`, is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`. Because both planets orbit the same star (`T_star`, `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A`), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. The relationship simplifies to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes). This crucial first step is correctly identified by virtually all the provided answers.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV)**: The semi-major axis (`a`) can be derived from the RV data. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by the transit method (where inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`), the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and orbital distance by `K² ∝ M_p² / a`. Rearranging this gives `a ∝ M_p² / K²`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n    This derivation is also performed correctly by all the thorough candidate answers.\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations**: Substituting the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2 yields:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )`\n    The square root and the squares cancel out, leading to the elegant final formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n6.  **Use Doppler Shift Data**: The RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of velocities `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: All candidate answers correctly substitute the given values into this final formula:\n    *   Mass ratio (`M_p₂ / M_p₁`): 5 / 7\n    *   Doppler shift ratio (`Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`): 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n8.  **Numerical Result**: `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\n### Conclusion Based on Consensus\n\nThere is a unanimous agreement among all candidate answers on the physical principles, the derivation of the formula, and the final numerical result of approximately **0.536**. The variation in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is an artifact of the agents being presented with scrambled option lists. The underlying scientific and mathematical conclusion is robust.\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.536` must be compared to the specific option list given in the main question:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe value `0.536` is unambiguously closest to `~ 0.53`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal and Relevant Information\nThe core task is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2. The key information provided is:\n- Both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. This is critical as it simplifies the equations.\n- Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses.\n- Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses.\n- Maximum Doppler shift from Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å.\n- Maximum Doppler shift from Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å.\n- Other information like planet radii, star properties (mass, radius, temperature), and the specific spectral line are extraneous for the final calculation as these terms cancel out.\n\n### 2. Consolidated Derivation\nA strong consensus on the derivation method exists across all candidate answers. The logic is as follows:\n\n*   **Step A: Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`), assuming the same star and albedo:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_1}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n*   **Step B: Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\n    The semi-major axis (`a`) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on the star. For a circular orbit where the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n    The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n*   **Step C: Combine the Ratios**\n    Substitute the result from Step B into the equation from Step A:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel, leaving a simple, elegant expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n### 3. Calculation\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift `Δλ`. Thus, the ratio `K₁/K₂` can be replaced with `Δλ₁/Δλ₂`. Now, we plug in the given values:\n- $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n- $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nPutting it all together:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### 4.

    "An analysis of the fifteen candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the physics and the calculation required to solve the problem. Every agent who showed their work correctly derived the same formula and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately **0.536**. The only discrepancies arose from matching this number to the multiple-choice letters (A, B, C, or D), which indicates the agents were presented with randomized option lists.\n\nThe correct approach, synthesized from the consensus, is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Goal Identification**: The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**: The radial velocity (RV) method gives us the tools to find the ratio of the semi-major axes. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality: $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$. Rearranging this to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n4.  **Combine the Ratios**: Substitute the relationship for $a$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other out, leading to the final elegant formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. These are distractors; they are not needed for the ratio calculation because they cancel out.\n*   **Transit Method Implication**: The problem mentions the planets were found by the transit method. This is a crucial piece of information that justifies assuming an orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (and thus $\\sin i \\approx 1$), which is necessary for the radial velocity formula to be used without an unknown inclination angle.\n*   **Handling Ratios**: It is critical to keep the subscripts correct during the derivation. Note that the final ratio $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$ depends on the mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ (inverted) but the Doppler shift ratio $K_1/K_2$ (not inverted).\n*   **Algebraic Simplification**: The easiest way to solve the problem is to simplify the equations algebraically first, leading to the final simple formula. This avoids complex intermediate calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value is approximately **0.536**. Matching this to the options provided in the question:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe result is unambiguously closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The problem is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance (`a`) to Radial Velocity (`K`)**: The semi-major axis (`a`) can be found from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via transits (inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(`i`) ≈ 1), the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on the star is related to its mass (`M_p`) and semi-major axis (`a`) by:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n    Rearranging to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a₂/a₁`)**: Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can form the ratio of the semi-major axes. The proportionality constants cancel out.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n    This derivation is also correctly performed by nearly all agents.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We can now substitute the expression for `a₂/a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    The square root and the squares cancel, yielding a simple final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (`K₁/K₂`) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ₁/Δλ₂`).

Identify the Goal and Relevant Physics\nThe main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n### 2. Simplify the Temperature Ratio\nWe are asked for the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are the same for both and cancel out in the ratio. This is a critical first step, noted by almost all the agents.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplification reveals that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes. Note that the star's temperature, radius, and mass, as well as the planets' radii, are ultimately not needed for this calculation.\n\n### 3. Relate Orbital Distance to Observation Data\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) must be related to the given radial velocity (RV) data (Doppler shift). The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n**Careful Point**: The problem states the planets were detected by the transit method. This means their orbits are seen edge-on, so the inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{a} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n### 4. Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nUsing the proportionality above, we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality (containing $G$ and $M_{star}$) cancel out.\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n### 5.

The vast majority of the candidate agents correctly performed this calculation, though some made errors in selecting the final letter, likely due to receiving a different or shuffled list of options. Based on a consistent and correct physical derivation, the numerical answer is ~0.536.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The core task is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, which can be expressed as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    When we form the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$, terms that are identical for both planets cancel out. The problem states that they orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo (so $A$ is the same). This leaves a simplified relationship:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This crucial first step shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes. All the provided candidate answers correctly identify this relationship.\n\n3.  **Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**: The next step is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$) using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star is approximately:\n    $K \\approx M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n    (The term $\\sin(i)$ is approximately 1 because the planets were detected by the transit method, implying their orbits are edge-on).\n\n    Rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a` gives:\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**: We can now form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants, the Gravitational Constant ($G$) and the mass of the star ($M_{star}$), are the same for both and cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Again, there is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on this derivation.\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Substitute Knowns**: Now, we substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other, yielding the final, simplified expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: We can now plug in the numerical values provided in the question:\n    *   Ratio of planet masses: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Ratio of Doppler shifts: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    Plugging these ratios into the final equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n7.  **Final Numerical Result**:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out from the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets. The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed for the final calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\n\nThe semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) that a planet induces on its star is given for a circular orbit by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, meaning their inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{a M_{star}} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. The constants $G$, $M_{star}$, and the $\\sin^2(i)$ term (which is ~1 for both) cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 3: Combine Ratios and Perform the Final Calculation\n\nSubstitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ from Step 2 into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leaving a simple relationship:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of velocities $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculated ratio is ~0.5357. We compare this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe value `0.5357` is clearly closest to `0.53`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying physics and mathematical derivation, with discrepancies arising almost entirely from matching the final numerical result to a multiple-choice letter, likely due to shuffled option lists.\n\nHere is a consolidated step-by-step derivation based on the correct reasoning demonstrated by the majority of the agents.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWe are asked for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out in the ratio.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes. Note that the specific values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not required for this calculation.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit (which is assumed) is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}}$ (where terms other than M_p and a are constant for a given system)\n\nSince both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbital inclinations ($i$) are approximately 90°, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{a} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out.\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 4: Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root cancels out the squares, yielding the final, simplified relationship:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**Step 5: Final Numerical Answer**\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

Here is the synthesized, step-by-step derivation of the correct answer.\n\n**1. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $a$ is the orbital semi-major axis, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the temperatures for Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$), we can divide their respective equations. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances. All candidate answers correctly identified this simplification.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe next step is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$) using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star is given by the following relation for a circular orbit where the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_{star}$):\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}}\\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits are edge-on, meaning $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n$a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. The constant terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\nThis derivation was also correctly and unanimously performed by the candidate agents.\n\n**3. Combine Formulas and Substitute Data**\nSubstitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ back into the temperature ratio formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\nThe square root cancels out the squares, leading to the simple final equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), so the ratio $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n**4.

The agents overwhelmingly agree on the methodology, even if they disagree on the final letter choice due to different option listings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on its distance from the star ($a$). The specific formula is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    When calculating the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) with the same albedo ($A$), all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This is the first critical step, and it is correctly identified by almost all the provided answers. The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**: The RV method provides the necessary data. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) caused by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}} $$\n    Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits are seen edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $$ a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2} $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: We can now form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$.

This step is consistently and correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data\nThe problem now is to find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the transit method (where inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), the semi-major axis ($a$) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the RV semi-amplitude it induces on the star ($K$) by the following proportionality:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\nUsing this relationship, we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\nThis derivation is also a point of consensus among the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Formulas and Substitute Data\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ from Step 3 into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel, leaving a simple final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nPlug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Step 6: Match Result to Options\nThe calculated numerical value is approximately **0.536**. Reviewing the options provided in the original question:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value of 0.536 is closest to 0.53, which corresponds to option C. The inconsistencies in the chosen letters among the candidate answers are due to them having differently ordered option lists. Based on the initial problem statement's list, C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a multi-step physics problem that requires combining formulas for planetary equilibrium temperature and stellar radial velocity. After a careful analysis of the reasoning provided by the candidate answers, a single correct pathway emerges, though some agents stumble on matching their final number to the correct letter option.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance ($a$) and albedo ($A$):\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\n    When we create the ratio for the two planets, all the terms related to the star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and the identical albedo ($A$) cancel out, leaving a much simpler expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This shows the temperature ratio is dependent only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes). The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides the data needed to find the ratio of the semi-major axes. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$), which is the maximum speed of the star's wobble, is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$) by the following formula (for a circular orbit and a system where the planet is transiting, so sin(i)≈1):\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}}$\n\n    Rearranging to solve for `a`:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n    Now, we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants `G` and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas and Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other out, yielding the final, simplified equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), so their ratios are equal: $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. Now we can plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.30\n    B) ~ 0.98\n    C) ~ 0.53\n    D) ~ 1.05\n\n    The calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    When we create the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, several terms cancel out because both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants for the ratio) and they have the same albedo (`A`). This leaves a simplified relationship that depends only on the semi-major axes (`a`) of their orbits:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data:**\n    The problem is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`. This can be found using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via transit (implying inclination i ≈ 90°), the star's RV semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and its semi-major axis (`a`) by the following proportionality:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    Rearranging to solve for `a`, we get:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\n    Using the proportionality above, we can form the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    Now substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other out, which gives a simple final expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Use Given Data for the Calculation:**\n    The problem gives us the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) rather than the RV semi-amplitudes (`K`). Since `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ`, the ratio `K1 / K2` is the same as the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`. We can now plug in the numbers from the problem statement:\n    *   Mass ratio: $M_{p2} / M_{p1} = 5 M_{Earth} / 7 M_{Earth} = 5/7$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4$\n\n    Substituting these values into the final equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n7.  **Final Result and Conclusion:**\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $15 / 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    The question's options are:\n    A) ~ 0.98\n    B) ~ 1.30\n    C) ~ 1.05\n    D) ~ 0.53\n\n    The calculated value `0.5357` is closest to `0.53`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Many of the provided details (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) are extraneous and not needed to solve the problem, as they cancel out in the ratio.\n*   The relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance is $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$.\n*   The relationship between RV semi-amplitude, planet mass, and orbital distance leads to $a \\propto M_p^2 / K^2$.\n*   Combining these relationships results in a simple final equation where the square roots cancel: $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2} = (M_{p2}/M_{p1}) \\times (K_1/K_2)$. This avoids having to calculate intermediate values for `a`.\n*   All candidate answers correctly derived the physics and arrived at the same numerical answer (`~0.536`), confirming the calculation is robust.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to reach the correct conclusion.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core task is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), orbiting the same star.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Derivation (Consensus Method)**\n\nA vast majority of the provided answers follow the same correct physical reasoning. I will consolidate that reasoning here.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio.**\n    The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    For two planets orbiting the same star (same T_star, R_star) and with the same albedo (A), the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes, `a`).\n\n*   **Step 2b: Relate Orbital Distance to Observation Data.**\n    The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (`K`) that a planet of mass `M_p` induces on its star is related to the semi-major axis `a`. For a circular orbit viewed edge-on (since it's a transiting system), the relationship can be shown to be:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n*   **Step 2c: Combine the Ratios.**\n    Substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel, leaving a simple, elegant formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n*   **Step 2d: Use the Given Values.**\n    The problem gives us the Doppler shift in wavelength (`Δλ`), which is directly proportional to the radial velocity `K`. Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n    *   Mass Ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$): 5 / 7\n    *   Doppler Shift Ratio ($Δλ₁/Δλ₂$): 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n    Plug these values into the final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**3.

This shows an overwhelming consensus on the correct physics and calculation.\n*   **Analysis of Options**: The disagreement among the candidate answers is due to confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to which value. This suggests the agents were working with scrambled option lists. I must rely on the definitive list provided in the question:\n    A) ~ 0.98\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 1.05\n    D) ~ 1.30\n*   **Final Match**: The calculated value, ~0.5357, is closest to **0.53**, which is option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem and determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Identify the Objective**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n### **2. Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ = Star's effective temperature\n*   $R_{star}$ = Star's radius\n*   $A$ = Planet's albedo\n*   $a$ = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance)\n\nWhen we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for two planets orbiting the same star, many terms cancel out.\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo (so $A_1 = A_2$). These terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out, simplifying the ratio significantly to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n### **3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe semi-major axis can be determined from the radial velocity data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) that the planet induces on its star is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{1/2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ = Planet's mass\n*   $M_{star}$ = Star's mass\n*   $i$ = Orbital inclination\n*   $G$ = Gravitational constant\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits are seen nearly edge-on, which means the inclination $i$ is approximately 90° for both planets, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n$K^2 \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{a} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can create the ratio for $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### **5. Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leading to a very simple final expression:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nFinally, we plug in the values given in the problem:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift from Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift from Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n### **6.

Because both planets orbit the same star (`T_star`, `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A`), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. The relationship simplifies to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes). This crucial first step is correctly identified by virtually all the provided answers.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV)**: The semi-major axis (`a`) can be derived from the RV data. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by the transit method (where inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`), the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and orbital distance by `K² ∝ M_p² / a`. Rearranging this gives `a ∝ M_p² / K²`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n    This derivation is also performed correctly by all the thorough candidate answers.\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations**: Substituting the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2 yields:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )`\n    The square root and the squares cancel out, leading to the elegant final formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n6.  **Use Doppler Shift Data**: The RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of velocities `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: All candidate answers correctly substitute the given values into this final formula:\n    *   Mass ratio (`M_p₂ / M_p₁`): 5 / 7\n    *   Doppler shift ratio (`Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`): 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n8.  **Numerical Result**: `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\n### Conclusion Based on Consensus\n\nThere is a unanimous agreement among all candidate answers on the physical principles, the derivation of the formula, and the final numerical result of approximately **0.536**.

Consolidated Derivation\nA strong consensus on the derivation method exists across all candidate answers. The logic is as follows:\n\n*   **Step A: Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`), assuming the same star and albedo:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_1}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n*   **Step B: Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\n    The semi-major axis (`a`) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on the star. For a circular orbit where the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n    The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n*   **Step C: Combine the Ratios**\n    Substitute the result from Step B into the equation from Step A:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel, leaving a simple, elegant expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n### 3. Calculation\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift `Δλ`. Thus, the ratio `K₁/K₂` can be replaced with `Δλ₁/Δλ₂`. Now, we plug in the given values:\n- $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n- $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nPutting it all together:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### 4.
