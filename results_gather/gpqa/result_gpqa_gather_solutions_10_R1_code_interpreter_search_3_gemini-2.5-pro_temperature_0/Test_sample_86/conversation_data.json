Deduce the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the two substituents are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nThe only common and stable 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\nSince it is a di-substituted ring, the substituents can be in the ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) position. Let's analyze the expected 1H NMR for these possibilities, focusing on the most symmetrical case first, which often appears in such problems.\n\n*   **Para-substituted (1,4-haloacetophenone):** This structure is symmetrical.\n    *   There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be one signal (a doublet).\n    *   The two protons ortho to the halogen will be another signal (a doublet).\n    *   The methyl protons (-CH3) of the acetyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so they will appear as a singlet integrating to 3H.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields its ortho protons more strongly (higher ppm value) than the halogen does. This pattern fits perfectly.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3H, is characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (-COCH3).\n    *   This data is fully consistent with the structure of a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would imply the 2-carbon substituent is -CH2CHO.\n    *   However, in a -CH2CHO group, the aldehyde proton (CHO) should be split by the adjacent methylene protons (CH2), appearing as a triplet. The data shows a singlet (1H, s). This is a significant inconsistency. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum does not show the expected pattern for a di-substituted benzene ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons). The signals are also in unusual regions for this type of compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B is the only one that accurately represents the 1H NMR spectrum of a compound that fits all the given criteria: a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo identify the correct 1H NMR data, let's first determine the possible structure of the compound based on the given information.\n\n### **Structural Analysis**\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The compound is based on a benzene ring with two substituents.\n2.  **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms, which means the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n4.  **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the halogen is one substituent, and the other substituent must contain two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable structure that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). To have the simplest and most distinct NMR spectrum presented in the options, a para (1,4) substitution pattern is the most likely arrangement.\n\nThe proposed structure is **p-haloacetophenone** (for example, 4-chloroacetophenone).\n\n### **1H NMR Prediction and Analysis of Options**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a p-haloacetophenone and compare it with the given choices.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-substituted benzene ring, the protons are split into two distinct sets. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent protons (ortho to the acetyl group), causing them to appear downfield (at a higher ppm value). The halogen is also electron-withdrawing. This pattern typically results in two doublets in the aromatic region (usually between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm). Since there are four protons on the ring, we expect to see a 2H doublet and another 2H doublet.\n*   **Methyl Protons:** The acetyl group's methyl protons (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a singlet. This signal is expected to have an integration of 3H and a chemical shift of around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct data for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   It also shows a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is the expected chemical shift and multiplicity for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a p-haloacetophenone. For instance, the actual reported shifts for 4-chloroacetophenone are approximately 7.90 ppm (d, 2H), 7.45 ppm (d, 2H), and 2.55 ppm (s, 3H), which is in very close agreement with this option.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, but this option shows only one proton in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deciphering the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n\nLet's combine these facts:\n*   Substituent 1: A halogen atom (-X). This has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   Substituent 2: Must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nSo, the compound is a halo-acetophenone.\n\n**2. Determining the Substitution Pattern from NMR Data:**\n\nThe problem states the ring is di-substituted, which means the two groups can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. Let's look at the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) of the NMR options:\n\n*   **A)** 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> Two signals, each representing 2 protons. This symmetry (two sets of two equivalent protons) is characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution**.\n*   **B)** No signals in the aromatic region. Incorrect.\n*   **C)** One signal for 1 proton. Incorrect for a di-substituted ring.\n*   **D)** 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> Also indicates a **para (1,4) substitution**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **para-haloacetophenone** (or 4-haloacetophenone).\n\n**3. Predicting the Full 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nNow let's predict the full spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone and compare it with options A and D.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons**: We've established this will be two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the 7-8 ppm range. Both A and D match this.\n*   **Substituent Protons**: The only other protons are in the acetyl group's methyl (-CH₃).\n    *   These 3 protons are on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group, but not adjacent to any other proton-bearing carbon.\n    *   Therefore, they should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (R-CO-CH₃) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Options:**\n\n*   **Option A**: `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`\n    *   Aromatic part: Matches the para-substitution pattern.\n    *   Aliphatic part: `2.3 (3H, s)` perfectly matches the predicted signal for the acetyl methyl group in terms of chemical shift, integration (3H), and splitting (singlet). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option D**: `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`\n    *   This option has a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. It also lacks the 3H singlet for the methyl group. This does not match our deduced structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a 4-haloacetophenone, and its 1H NMR spectrum is correctly described by option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical information to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n    1.  **Analyze the compound description:**\n        - Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring: A benzene ring with two groups.\n        - 8 total carbon atoms: 6 in the ring, 2 in the substituents.\n        - FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\n\n    2.  **Deduce the structure:**\n        - One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n        - The other must have 2 carbons and a C=O group.

This means it's a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **Molecular Formula Information:** It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Deduce the possible structure of the compound.**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   A 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl (C=O) is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).**\n\n*   We need to look at the patterns in the aromatic region of the provided 1H NMR options.\n*   Options A and C both show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (e.g., `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`).\n*   This specific pattern (two doublets of equal integration) is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and they split each other into two doublets.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** As established, the para-substitution will result in two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm). Each doublet will integrate to 2H. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than those closer to the halogen.\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the methyl protons will not be split and will appear as a **singlet**. This signal will integrate to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl ketone (Ar-COCH₃) is around **2.0-2.7 ppm**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. The peak at 3.7 ppm is for 2H, not 3H. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the correct range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the four protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm, which is exactly what is expected for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n    *   This option is a perfect match for our deduced structure of 4-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the correct range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that matches all the structural features derived from the problem description is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided about the compound to determine its chemical structure.\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the compound has a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. The core formula is C6H4.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group (C=O).\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\nNow, let's piece this information together:\n*   We have two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The only common chemical group that fits this description (2 carbons, 1 carbonyl) is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure perfectly matches all the given criteria.\n\n**2. Predict the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow that we have the structure, we can predict what its 1H NMR spectrum should look like. A haloacetophenone molecule has two main sets of protons:\n\n*   **The Acetyl Methyl Protons (-COCH3)**: These three protons are on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically in the range of **2.0-2.6 ppm**, and the signal will integrate to **3H**.\n*   **The Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**: There are four protons on the benzene ring. Their chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region, typically **7.0-8.5 ppm**. The splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**3. Analyze the Given NMR Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our prediction.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This is a perfect match for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two signals in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **para (1,4-) disubstituted** benzene ring. This high degree of symmetry is expected for a para-isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The chemical shifts are incorrect for the proposed structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde, its substituents would be -CHO and a halogen -X. This structure (X-C6H4-CHO) only has 7 carbon atoms, which contradicts the given information of 8 total carbons.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. For example, a 1H singlet in the aromatic region is not expected for this type of compound.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The key features are the 3H singlet for the acetyl group and the characteristic pattern of two 2H doublets in the aromatic region, indicating a para-substituted ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆H₄). This accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This leaves 2 carbons for the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This means one substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I), and the other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the remaining two carbons.\n*   **Substituents:** The halogen substituent has zero carbon atoms. Therefore, the second substituent must contain both carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Compound Identity:** The compound is a haloacetophenone (C₈H₇XO).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Substitution Pattern and Expected NMR\n\nThe two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n\n*   **Acetyl Group Signal:** The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) in the acetyl substituent are equivalent and not coupled to any other protons. They will appear as a sharp **singlet (s)**, integrating to 3H, typically in the chemical shift range of 2-3 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Proton Signals:**\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4):** This arrangement is symmetrical. There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a simple pattern of **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm), with each doublet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution (1,2):** This arrangement is unsymmetrical, and all four aromatic protons are chemically different. This would lead to a complex pattern of four signals, likely multiplets, in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Meta-substitution (1,3):** This arrangement is also unsymmetrical and would produce a more complex spectrum than the para isomer, likely with four distinct signals.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare the predicted spectra with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is characteristic of an acetyl group's methyl protons.\n    *   It also shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons. This pattern is the hallmark of a para-substituted (1,4) benzene ring.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **p-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows a singlet at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets at ~7.45 ppm and ~7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4'-Bromoacetophenone shows a singlet at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets at ~7.6 ppm and ~7.8 ppm. The values in option A are consistent with these known compounds.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks the characteristic 3H singlet for an acetyl group and the typical aromatic signals. The chemical shifts are not in the expected range for this type of compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   While there is a 3H singlet, its chemical shift (1.3 ppm) is too low for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. The other signals are not in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. An aldehyde would not fit the 8-carbon total with the remaining signals. This option does not match the deduced structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data presented in option A is the only one that correctly represents the signals for such a structure: a singlet for the acetyl methyl group and two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) is directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   Based on the criteria, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these gives the molecular formula C₈H₇XO and the structure of a haloacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The problem describes a di-substituted ring. The relative positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the pattern of the signals in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Para (1,4) substitution:** This arrangement is symmetrical. It would produce two distinct signals for the aromatic protons, with each signal integrating to 2 protons (2H). Due to coupling with adjacent protons, these signals would appear as doublets.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) substitution:** This arrangement is asymmetrical and would result in four separate signals for the four aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H with more complex splitting.\n    *   **Meta (1,3) substitution:** This is also an asymmetrical arrangement that would produce four distinct 1H signals in the aromatic region.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. While a structure like p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde has 8 carbons and a carbonyl, the halogen is not directly attached to the aromatic ring, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option also lacks the characteristic signals for a di-substituted benzene ring and is therefore incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are a classic sign of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is characteristic of the methyl protons in an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-Bromoacetophenone is: δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61(d, 2H), 2.57 (s, 3H). Similarly, the spectrum for 4-Chloroacetophenone is: δ 7.91 (d, 2H), 7.45 (d, 2H), 2.61 (s, 3H). The data in option D is highly consistent with these known compounds.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the NMR data in option D is the only one that correctly represents a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆).\n    *   It is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   The total carbon count is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbons.\n    *   FTIR data confirms a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the ring).\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). This substituent has 0 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and both of the remaining 2 carbons. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its structure is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data Options:**\n    *   The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This molecule has protons on the aromatic ring (4H) and protons on the methyl group (3H).\n    *   Protons on an aromatic ring typically appear in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   The protons of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group) typically appear as a singlet around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This would correspond to a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which is an isomer. However, the description of the methylene (-CH₂) and aldehyde (-CHO) protons as singlets is generally inaccurate, as they would couple to each other.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts are mostly outside the typical aromatic proton region. This data does not match an aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region, `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet at `2.3 (3H, s)`. A singlet integrating to three protons in this chemical shift region is perfectly characteristic of an acetyl methyl group (-COCH₃).\n        *   This data is an excellent match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) and cannot be correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option C accurately describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone, which fits all the conditions given in the problem description.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by two other groups (substituents). The formula for this core is -C6H4-.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: A carbonyl group is a C=O double bond.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents attached directly to the aromatic ring is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I). Let's denote it as -X.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and all 2 of the remaining carbon atoms.\n*   The most common and stable group that fits this description is the **acetyl group**: -COCH3. It has exactly two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n**3. Consider the Positional Isomers**\n\nThe two substituents (acetyl and halogen) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring:\n*   **ortho (1,2-substitution)**: The groups are on adjacent carbons.\n*   **meta (1,3-substitution)**: The groups are separated by one carbon.\n*   **para (1,4-substitution)**: The groups are on opposite sides of the ring.\n\nThe pattern of signals in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this substitution pattern.\n*   For *ortho* and *meta* substitution, the molecule is asymmetrical. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublets, triplets).\n*   For *para* substitution, the molecule is symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons. This symmetry leads to a much simpler spectrum: two signals, each being a doublet, and each integrating to 2H.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data Options**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for our proposed structure (a haloacetophenone) and compare it with the options.\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. They should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n*   **Aromatic protons (-C6H4-)**: There are 4 protons on the ring. Their chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region, typically **6.5-8.5 ppm**. Both the acetyl group and the halogen are electron-withdrawing, which will shift these protons downfield (to higher ppm values).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on this prediction:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a perfect match for the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift, integration (3H), and splitting (singlet) are all correct.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriately downfield due to the electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This data perfectly matches the structure of a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. An aldehyde group only has one carbon, which contradicts the \"8 carbon atoms in total\" information (C6 ring + C1 aldehyde + C(X) = 7 carbons). Also, there is no 3H singlet for the methyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too far upfield.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Incorrect. This does not represent an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`), whereas a di-substituted benzene ring must have four.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOption A is the only choice that is fully consistent with all the information provided: a di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, a halogen, and the resulting NMR signal patterns for a *para*-substituted acetophenone derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H4) that has two groups attached to it.\n*   **Molecular Formula Constraint:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, one substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n*   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond, satisfying all the given conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow, we need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in three different ways on the ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4). The NMR spectrum will reveal the substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Signal 1: The Acetyl Methyl Group (-COCH3)**\n    *   The three protons on this methyl group are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will not be split.\n    *   This will appear as a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   It will integrate to **3H**.\n    *   Its chemical shift is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm** because it's attached to a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: The Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**\n    *   The pattern of these signals depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   ***ortho* or *meta* substitution:** These isomers lack symmetry, resulting in four unique aromatic protons. This would produce a complex set of signals (multiplets), not simple patterns.\n        *   ***para* (1,4) substitution:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is a pair of doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks the key features. There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), and there is no 3H singlet for the acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a methyl ketone. An aldehyde group only has one carbon, which would mean the compound is a C7 species (e.g., p-halobenzaldehyde), contradicting the 8-carbon requirement. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the described aromatic compound. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic ring with a carbonyl and a halogen is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    *   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it is a benzene ring with two substituents (a C₆H₄ core).\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The spectrum shows a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond.\" This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the ring.\n    *   **Assembling the Pieces:** The halogen substituent (-X) contains 0 carbon atoms. Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion on Structure:** The compound is a haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the possible isomers and predict their ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three ways: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **The Acetyl Group Protons:** In all three isomers, the methyl group (-CH₃) is not adjacent to any other protons, so it will always appear as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.2-2.7 ppm.\n    *   **The Aromatic Protons:** The di-substituted ring has 4 protons.\n        *   For *ortho* and *meta* isomers, the molecule is asymmetrical. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely with complex splitting patterns.\n        *   For the ***para* isomer**, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons adjacent to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the halogen equivalent to each other. This symmetry results in a very clean and characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted spectra with the given options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not the methyl protons of a ketone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical chemical shift range for aromatic protons (which is ~6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. It does not show the correct number of aromatic protons, and the singlet at 1.3 ppm integrates to 2H, not the 3H required for a methyl group.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **This is the correct answer.** It perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:\n            *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern of two doublets for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n            *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift that is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the given information to deduce the molecular structure.**\n    *   The compound has a **di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**. This is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is **8**. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)**. This means one substituent is a halogen atom (like -Cl, -Br, etc.) attached directly to the ring, and the other substituent contains the carbonyl group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   Since a halogen atom contains no carbon, the second substituent must be a group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable such group is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO. This molecule has 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure.**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring can have ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) substitution. For multiple-choice questions, the most symmetrical isomer, **para-substitution**, is often used because it gives the simplest, most recognizable spectrum.\n    *   Let's consider the structure of **4-haloacetophenone**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** Due to the symmetry of the para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This results in two signals in the aromatic region (typically > 7.0 ppm). Each signal corresponds to 2 protons and appears as a **doublet** due to splitting by its single neighboring proton. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be shifted significantly downfield (e.g., ~7.8-8.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the halogen will also be downfield (e.g., ~7.5-7.7 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (-CH3):** The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). Since the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons, this signal will be a **singlet**. It will integrate to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Summary of Prediction for 4-haloacetophenone:**\n        1.  A doublet, ~7.8 ppm, integrating to 2H.\n        2.  A doublet, ~7.6 ppm, integrating to 2H.\n        3.  A singlet, ~2.3 ppm, integrating to 3H.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the prediction with the given options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s):** The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s):** This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm), each for 2H, which is characteristic of a para-substituted ring. It also shows a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is perfect for a methyl ketone. This option is an excellent match for our predicted spectrum of 4-haloacetophenone.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s):** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This is inconsistent with the most likely structure.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s):** The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The splitting pattern and integrations do not match a di-substituted benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone, which fits all the criteria given in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo identify the correct 1H NMR data, we must first deduce the most likely structure of the compound based on the provided information.\n\n### Structural Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄).\n2.  **Total Carbons**: The molecule contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n3.  **Functional Groups**: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\nBased on these points, we can determine the nature of the two substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nThe most common and stable substituent fitting the \"2 carbons and a carbonyl\" description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃). This gives us a haloacetophenone structure (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n\nAnother possibility could be a formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO), leading to a halophenylacetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n### 1H NMR Data Interpretation\n\nNow, let's analyze the given NMR options in the context of these possible structures. The options B and C both show a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This \"two-doublet\" pattern is highly characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring, which creates a symmetrical molecule.\n\n*   **Option A and D** can be eliminated. Option D lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Option A shows only one proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons).\n\nWe are left with options B and C, which correspond to the two plausible *para*-substituted structures:\n\n*   **Structure for Option C**: *p*-haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group directly attached to the ring, which strongly deshields the aromatic protons, shifting them downfield. The provided shifts of 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm are consistent with this. For example, the aromatic protons of *p*-chloroacetophenone are found at approximately 7.89 ppm and 7.43 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl protons**: The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are adjacent to a carbonyl, but not to any other protons, so they appear as a singlet. A chemical shift of ~2.3-2.6 ppm is typical for an acetyl group's methyl protons. The value of 2.3 ppm in option C is a very reasonable value.\n    *   The data in option C: **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)** is fully consistent with the structure of a *p*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Structure for Option B**: *p*-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n    *   **Aldehyde proton**: The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   **Methylene protons**: The signal at 3.7 ppm is appropriate for methylene protons (-CH₂) situated between an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: In this structure, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is separated from the ring by a -CH₂- group. This separation reduces its deshielding effect on the aromatic protons compared to acetophenone. Therefore, the aromatic proton signals would be expected at a higher field (lower ppm value), typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The shifts of 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm given in option B are too far downfield for this structure. For instance, the aromatic protons of 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (a similar structure) appear around 7.3 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical shifts for the aromatic protons in option C (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are much more consistent with the strong deshielding effect of a carbonyl group directly attached to the aromatic ring, as in *p*-haloacetophenone. The data in option B, while correctly identifying an aldehyde, presents aromatic shifts that are inconsistent with the proposed structure. Therefore, the compound is a *p*-haloacetophenone, and the correct NMR data is provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n*   **Substitution:** It is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\nBased on this information, one substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). The other substituent must contain the two carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure satisfies all the given conditions: it's a di-substituted benzene ring, has 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the acetyl group), contains a carbonyl group, and has an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Options\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given 1H NMR data options based on the predicted structure of a haloacetophenone. The substitution can be ortho, meta, or para. A common pattern in these problems involves the highly symmetric para (1,4) substitution.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. A structure like p-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO) would have 8 carbons. However, the aldehyde proton should be a triplet (split by the adjacent CH2 group), and the CH2 protons should be a doublet (split by the CHO proton). The data shows two singlets, which contradicts the expected splitting pattern.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are shifted further downfield (deshielded) compared to the two protons closer to the halogen.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3 protons, is in the typical chemical shift range for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of a 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone). For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet for the methyl group at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons at ~7.45 ppm and ~7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows a methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm and aromatic signals around 7.62 ppm and 7.83 ppm. The values in option C are consistent with this structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which would have 4 aromatic protons). The other signals are not in the expected regions for the proposed structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that correctly corresponds to a di-substituted, 8-carbon aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The structure is a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n*   **Di-substituted:** There are two substituents on the benzene ring, so the core is C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nLet's deduce the substituents. One substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, which include two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most plausible structure for this second substituent is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n\nCombining these parts, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 carbons in the ring and 2 in the acetyl group, totaling the required 8 carbons.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nFor a haloacetophenone, we expect signals from two types of protons:\n\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically in the range of 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-):** There are four protons on the di-substituted ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4):** This arrangement is symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are split into two chemically distinct sets. This typically results in two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution (1,2):** This would result in a more complex pattern, likely with four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Meta-substitution (1,3):** This would also lead to a complex pattern, generally showing four distinct signals.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nLet's compare our expected spectrum with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This signal perfectly matches the expected singlet for the 3 protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region (downfield of 7 ppm) is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. For instance, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows two doublets for the aromatic protons at approximately 7.91 ppm and 7.45 ppm, and a singlet for the methyl protons at 2.61 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows aromatic signals around 7.83 ppm and 7.61 ppm, with the methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm. The data in option A is highly consistent with a para-haloacetophenone structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (usually > 6.5 ppm). The integration and splitting patterns do not match our expected structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option B, the signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are incorrect for aromatic protons. The singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl ketone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts the structure we deduced (an acetophenone).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option A, featuring a singlet for three protons around 2.3 ppm and two doublets for two protons each in the aromatic region, is the only choice that accurately represents this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The general formula for the ring portion is C6H4.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n    *   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One substituent is a halogen atom (like -Cl, -Br, -I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen atom has 0 carbons.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Substituents and the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on the C6H4 ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This accounts for 0 of the 2 carbons needed for the substituents.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The simplest and most common 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Possible Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    The molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring, so it can exist as ortho, meta, or para isomers. Let's consider the expected 1H NMR patterns for the aromatic protons (the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring):\n    *   **Ortho-isomer:** The 4 aromatic protons would be non-equivalent and would show a complex multiplet pattern.\n    *   **Meta-isomer:** The 4 aromatic protons would also show a complex pattern, although sometimes one proton might appear as a broad singlet.\n    *   **Para-isomer:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. The 4 aromatic protons are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H at 6.9 ppm), which contradicts a di-substituted ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic signature of a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Alkyl Region:** It shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H. This is the expected signal for the methyl (-CH3) protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3), which are a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. The chemical shift is also appropriate.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the structure of **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This molecule contains an aldehyde, not a ketone as deduced. If the molecule were 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (C8H7XO), it would fit some of the data, but critically, the halogen would be on a methyl group (Ar-CH2-X), not directly on the ring. The problem explicitly states an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** was detected by FTIR. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is 4-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two doublets in the aromatic region for the para-substituted ring and a singlet for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. Option C is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms (C₆H₄).\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a C=O double bond. This must be part of one of the substituents.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** The FTIR data also indicates a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n### **2. Determine the Possible Structure**\n\nBased on the information above, we can deduce the two substituents on the benzene ring:\n1.  A **halogen atom** (–X).\n2.  A substituent containing **2 carbons and a carbonyl group**. The most common and stable arrangement for this is an **acetyl group** (–COCH₃).\n\nCombining these parts, the most likely molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The total formula would be C₈H₇XO, which is consistent with the requirements.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. Let's consider the ¹H NMR spectrum for the most symmetrical and common arrangement, the **para (1,4) substitution**.\n\n*   **Structure:** 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone).\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** Due to the para substitution, the four protons on the benzene ring are divided into two chemically equivalent sets. This typically results in two distinct signals, each appearing as a doublet and integrating to 2 protons. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield).\n*   **Substituent Protons:** The acetyl group (–COCH₃) has three equivalent protons on the methyl group. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a singlet, integrating to 3 protons.\n\nTherefore, the predicted ¹H NMR spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone is:\n*   A doublet for 2H in the aromatic region (~7.6-8.0 ppm).\n*   Another doublet for 2H in the aromatic region (~7.4-7.7 ppm).\n*   A singlet for 3H in the aliphatic region (~2.3-2.6 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This option corresponds to (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde. While this structure fits the carbon count and functional groups, the aldehyde (CHO) and adjacent methylene (CH₂) protons would typically split each other into a triplet and a doublet, respectively. The observation of two singlets is atypical.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 7-8 ppm), so it cannot represent an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the prediction for 4-haloacetophenone. It shows the characteristic para-substituted aromatic pattern of two doublets for two protons each and a methyl singlet for three protons. The chemical shifts are well within the expected ranges.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows 1 aromatic proton, which is inconsistent.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula, functional groups, and substitution pattern derived from the problem description point to 4-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data in option C is the only one that correctly and unambiguously represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   **Base Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means we start with a benzene ring (C6).\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** indicates one substituent contains this functional group.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond** means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain the C=O group and both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms. The only common and stable group that fits this is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   The structure is a haloacetophenone.\n\n**2. Determine the Substitution Pattern:**\n\nThe problem is to identify the correct 1H NMR data. Let's analyze the patterns given in the options.\n\n*   Options A and C show a pattern of `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm). This is a classic, simplified pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. Due to symmetry, the two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   Ortho or meta substitution would lead to more complex splitting patterns with potentially four distinct signals.\n\nBased on the options, the compound is **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** We expect two signals in the aromatic region (~7.0-8.0 ppm). Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, so the protons will be deshielded (shifted downfield). The pattern will be two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Acetyl Group Protons:** The `-COCH3` group has a methyl group. These 3 protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3 protons**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s) ... 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) ...**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the typical range for aromatic protons.

Option C is the only choice that matches this prediction.\nThe correct choice is: C\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided about the compound.**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H4) that has two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is F, Cl, Br, or I) is present.\n\n**Step 2: Propose a plausible chemical structure.**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, one substituent is a halogen (-X) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen (from the carbonyl group).\n*   The most common and stable functional group that fits the \"2 carbons and a C=O\" description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n*   The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a halogen on the ring, a carbonyl group, and is di-substituted. This fits all the given information.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons on the ring. The splitting pattern of these protons depends on the positions of the substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n*   The options provided (especially C and D) show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H). This highly symmetric pattern is characteristic of **para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution)**. In a para-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and each proton has only one adjacent proton to couple with, resulting in two doublets.\n*   Let's assume the compound is **para-haloacetophenone**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (on the ring):**\n    *   There will be 4 aromatic protons in total.\n    *   They will appear as two signals because of the ring's symmetry.\n    *   Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, so the protons will be deshielded and appear downfield (typically between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm).\n    *   We expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H. For example: δ ≈ 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and δ ≈ 7.6 ppm (2H, d).\n*   **Aliphatic Protons (on the substituents):**\n    *   The only aliphatic protons are on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent (-COCH3).\n    *   This methyl group has 3 protons, so its signal will integrate to 3H.\n    *   It is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will not be split, appearing as a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm. We expect a signal like: δ ≈ 2.3 ppm (3H, s).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This option shows only 1 proton in the aromatic region. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches the expected signal for an acetyl group's methyl protons.\n    *   This option is fully consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). If the compound were an aldehyde (e.g., para-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde, X-C6H4-CH2CHO), the aldehyde proton would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 protons, appearing as a triplet, not a singlet. Similarly, the CH2 protons would appear as a doublet, not a singlet. The multiplicities in this option are inconsistent with a plausible structure. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only NMR data that matches the deductions from the molecular formula and FTIR data is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O double bond.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** This tells us that one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Substituents**\n\n*   We have two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This accounts for 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both remaining carbon atoms (2 carbons) and the carbonyl group.\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   Therefore, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**3. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   Combining the benzene ring with the two substituents, the compound must be a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   Let's check if this structure fits all the criteria:\n    *   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl group) = 8. Yes.\n    *   Carbonyl group: Yes, in the acetyl group.\n    *   Aromatic-halogen bond: Yes, the halogen is directly on the ring.\n*   The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO, which means the molecule has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the ring, 3 in the methyl group).\n\n**4. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nNow we must find the 1H NMR spectrum that matches a haloacetophenone structure. Let's assume the most symmetric isomer, para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution), as it gives a simple, recognizable NMR pattern.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at **9.9 ppm** is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO). Our structure is a ketone, not an aldehyde. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (approximately 6.5-8.5 ppm). This spectrum cannot belong to an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, doublet)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, doublet)** are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The two sets of equivalent protons split each other into doublets. The chemical shifts are downfield, which is consistent with the presence of two electron-withdrawing groups (the halogen and the acetyl group).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, singlet)** is characteristic of a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (-COCH₃)**. It is a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbon atom to cause splitting.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a p-haloacetophenone. The total number of protons is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which is correct.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The pattern of signals is not consistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option C, showing a para-substituted aromatic pattern and a methyl ketone singlet, is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The compound is based on a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbons.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Deduce Possible Structures:**\n    *   Based on the information, a halogen (X) is one substituent.\n    *   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. Two common structures fit this description:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃). This would form a **haloacetophenone**.\n        *   A formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO). This would form a **halophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Both of these potential structures have a total of 8 carbon atoms (6 from the ring + 2 from the side chain), a carbonyl group, and a halogen attached to the ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Options A and B both show two doublets around 7.6-7.8 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons (2H). This pattern is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. Options C and D do not fit this description. Option C lacks any aromatic signals (6.5-8.5 ppm) and is incorrect. Option D's pattern is inconsistent with a di-substituted ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region & Functional Groups:**\n        *   **Option A:** Shows a singlet at 9.9 ppm (1H) and a singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H). The signal at 9.9 ppm is definitive for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). The signal at 3.7 ppm is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. This data perfectly matches the structure of a **(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The integration (1+2+2+2 = 7 protons) is correct for this structure. For example, the reported spectrum for 2-(4-bromophenyl)acetaldehyde shows peaks at 9.70 ppm (t, 1H), 7.50 ppm (d, 2H), 7.08 ppm (d, 2H), and 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). This closely matches the data in option A.\n        *   **Option B:** Shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H). This signal is characteristic of a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl** (-COCH₃). This data corresponds to a **4-haloacetophenone**. The integration (2+2+3 = 7 protons) is also correct for this structure. For example, the reported spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows peaks around 7.6-7.9 ppm and a methyl singlet around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Option C & D:** These are incorrect as they do not show the characteristic peaks for an aromatic compound as described.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both options A and B represent plausible structures that fit the initial description. However, they describe two different compounds: (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde and 4-haloacetophenone, respectively. Since the question provides a specific set of data options, we must choose the one that is listed. Both are valid spectra for compounds fitting the criteria, but only one can be the correct answer choice. Reviewing the choices, Option A provides a complete and consistent set of data for (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\nThe data presented in option A is:\n*   **9.9 ppm (1H, s):** Aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n*   **7.8 ppm (2H, d) & 7.6 ppm (2H, d):** Para-substituted aromatic ring protons.\n*   **3.7 ppm (2H, s):** Methylene protons (-CH₂-) adjacent to the ring and the carbonyl.\n\nThis set of data is a perfect match for a (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde, which fulfills all the conditions given in the prompt.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which is a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means a halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**, with the general formula **X-C₆H₄-COCH₃**. This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring, fitting all the given criteria.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Substitution Pattern and Expected ¹H NMR\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. The ¹H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** These protons appear in the downfield region, typically between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm.\n    *   For **ortho** or **meta** substitution, there would be four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex pattern of signals.\n    *   For **para** (1,4) substitution, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in a simpler and very characteristic pattern: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a single sharp peak (a singlet). This signal is typically found around 2.3–2.6 ppm.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare the expected spectrum with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is incorrect for a benzene derivative.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 6.9 ppm is low for an acetophenone derivative. More importantly, the singlet at 1.3 ppm integrates to 2H, which is inconsistent with a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are the classic A₂B₂ pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons, shifting them further downfield (7.8 ppm) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen (7.6 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is exactly what is expected for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-Bromoacetophenone shows a singlet at 2.60 ppm and two signals for the aromatic protons at 7.61-7.63 ppm and 7.83-7.84 ppm. Similarly, 4-Chloroacetophenone shows a methyl singlet at 2.61 ppm and doublets at 7.45 ppm and 7.91 ppm. The values in option C are consistent with these reported spectra.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. While an aldehyde contains a carbonyl group, the rest of the structure required to fit this NMR data would contradict the condition of having an \"aromatic-halogen bond\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data presented in option C is the only one that correctly represents all the structural features of the described compound, specifically pointing to a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule based on the information provided and then determine which of the given ¹H NMR spectra corresponds to that structure.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆).\n*   **Total Carbons:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the substituents must contain the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Di-substituted:** There are two groups attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the two substituents are a halogen atom (-X) and a group containing a carbonyl and a methyl group. The most plausible structure for this second substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Data\n\nNow we need to analyze the provided ¹H NMR options to see which one matches the structure of a haloacetophenone. A key feature of the ¹H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted benzene ring is the pattern of the aromatic protons (in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). The substitution can be *ortho*, *meta*, or *para*.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not the methyl ketone we deduced. This spectrum would better fit a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The integration of the aromatic region is only 1H, which is incorrect for a di-substituted benzene ring (it should have 4 aromatic protons).\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (> 6.5 ppm), so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **para (1,4) substituted** benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are shifted further downfield (deshielded) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The signal at **2.3 ppm** is a singlet integrating to 3 protons. This is the exact expected chemical shift and multiplicity for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ¹H NMR data in option D perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **p-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet for the methyl group around 2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons at approximately 7.45 ppm and 7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows the methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm and aromatic signals at 7.62 and 7.83 ppm. The values in option D are well within the expected range for this class of compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n    *   **Molecular Framework:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** \"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\". Since the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n        *   \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X). This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This fits the criteria (2 carbons, one C=O).\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also fits the criteria (2 carbons, one C=O).\n        *   **Carboxymethyl group (-CH2COOH):** This fits, but carboxylic acids have a very characteristic broad OH peak in the FTIR and a very downfield proton (>10 ppm) in the 1H NMR, which is not suggested by all options.\n    *   Based on these possibilities, the most likely molecular structures are a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) or a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) should show signals for 4 aromatic protons, typically in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum shows no signals in the aromatic region (> 6.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H). A di-substituted benzene ring must have four. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**:\n        *   The signal at **9.9 ppm (1H, s)** is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest the structure is a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n        *   The signal at **3.7 ppm (2H, s)** would correspond to the -CH2- group.\n        *   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** are from the 4 aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets suggests *para* substitution.\n        *   **Critique:** In a phenylacetaldehyde structure, the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group is insulated from the ring by a -CH2- group. Its effect on the aromatic proton chemical shifts is weakened. The aromatic protons for a compound like *p*-chlorophenylacetaldehyde appear around 7.2-7.3 ppm. The shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are too far downfield for this structure.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**:\n        *   The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH3). This suggests the structure is a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n        *   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** are from the 4 aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets suggests *para* substitution.\n        *   **Critique:** In a *p*-haloacetophenone structure, the strongly electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring, causing the ortho protons to shift significantly downfield. The halogen also influences the shifts. This combination perfectly explains the downfield aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. For instance, the actual spectrum of *p*-bromoacetophenone is ~7.82 (d), ~7.60 (d), ~2.59 (s). Option D is an excellent match for this structure.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecule that fits all the given information (di-substituted aromatic, 8 carbons, C=O, Ar-X) and matches the NMR data is a *para*-haloacetophenone. Option D provides the spectrum that corresponds to this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and all 2 remaining carbon atoms. The most logical structure for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**3. Consider the Positional Isomers**\n\nSince the benzene ring is di-substituted, there are three possible isomers:\n*   **ortho-haloacetophenone** (1,2-substitution)\n*   **meta-haloacetophenone** (1,3-substitution)\n*   **para-haloacetophenone** (1,4-substitution)\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Isomers**\n\nWe need to predict the signals (chemical shift, integration, splitting) for the protons in the molecule. The molecule has protons on the aromatic ring (4H) and on the acetyl group's methyl (3H), for a total of 7 protons.\n\n*   **Acetyl Group (-COCH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Because the methyl group is attached to a carbonyl, it will be deshielded and appear around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** The pattern for the 4 aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern.\n    *   **ortho-isomer:** All 4 aromatic protons are in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex spectrum with four distinct signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not the simple patterns shown in the options.\n    *   **meta-isomer:** This would also lead to a complex pattern, likely with four distinct signals for the 4 non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **para-isomer:** This isomer has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent (let's call them Hₐ).\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent (let's call them Hₑ).\n        *   Each Hₐ proton is coupled only to an adjacent Hₑ proton, so the Hₐ signal will be a **doublet (d)** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Similarly, each Hₑ proton is coupled only to an adjacent Hₐ proton, so the Hₑ signal will be a **doublet (d)** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing and will deshield its ortho protons (Hₐ) significantly, pushing them downfield (higher ppm value) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen (Hₑ). We expect the aromatic signals to be in the **7.0-8.0 ppm** range.\n\n**5. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\nOur predicted spectrum for the most likely isomer, **para-haloacetophenone**, is:\n*   A doublet for 2H (aromatic)\n*   Another doublet for 2H (aromatic)\n*   A singlet for 3H (acetyl methyl) at ~2.3 ppm\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone. We have two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group. The downfield doublet at 7.8 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the deshielding carbonyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The integration of 2H for the singlet at 1.3 ppm is also incorrect for a methyl group.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. A 3H singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone (-COCH₃). The problem's constraints (8 carbons, di-substituted ring) strongly point to a ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the 1H NMR data in option A is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   **Atom Count:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, which means the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the possible chemical structure(s):**\n    *   We have a benzene ring as the core structure.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). A halogen atom contributes 0 carbon atoms to the total count.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The most common and stable chemical group that fits the formula C2HnO and contains a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Let's verify this proposed structure: **Haloacetophenone**.\n        *   Total Carbons: 6 (from the benzene ring) + 2 (from the acetyl group) = 8. This matches the requirement.\n        *   Substituents: A halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). This is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   Functional Groups: The structure contains an aromatic-halogen bond and a carbonyl group (from the ketone). This matches the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the substitution pattern and predict the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents can be in the *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4) positions.\n    *   Let's examine the aromatic proton signals in the answer choices. Options A and D both show a `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern (two doublets, each integrating to two protons) in the aromatic region (chemical shift > 7 ppm).\n    *   This specific pattern is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude the compound is a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** We expect two signals for the 4 aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be shifted downfield (higher ppm value). The two protons ortho to the halogen will be slightly more upfield (lower ppm value). They split each other, so we expect two doublets. A typical range would be approximately 7.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The structure has an acetyl group, -COCH3. The three protons of this methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s) integrating to 3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Compare the prediction with the given options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This data does not match our structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts are incorrect. The aromatic signals are missing (should be > 7 ppm).\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option also lacks any signals in the aromatic region. It cannot be correct.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This chemical shift and multiplicity are a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH**3**).\n        *   This dataset is a perfect match for our deduced structure, **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and basic structure.**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   It is di-substituted, meaning two hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced by other groups. This gives a C6H4 core.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen atom directly attached to the benzene ring).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the two substituents.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the carbonyl group and both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms. The most plausible functional group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The general structure is X-C6H4-C(=O)CH3.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) from the 1H NMR data.**\n    *   The aromatic region of a 1H NMR spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) is very informative about the substitution pattern on a benzene ring.\n    *   Let's look at the aromatic signals in the given options:\n        *   A) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   B) 6.9 (1H, s) (signals at 4.6-4.8 are not aromatic)\n        *   C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   D) No aromatic signals.\n    *   A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature for a **para (1,4) di-substituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer makes the two protons ortho to the first substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the second substituent equivalent. This results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by its single, non-equivalent neighbor.\n    *   Therefore, the compound must be a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the complete 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone and compare it with the options.**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n              O\n              ||\n              C-CH3\n              |\n          /¯¯¯\\_/¯¯¯\\\n         |     |     |\n         \\___/¯\\___/\n              |\n              X (Halogen)\n        ```\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** As determined in Step 3, there will be two doublets, representing a total of 4 protons. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the two protons ortho to it will be more deshielded (further downfield, higher ppm). The halogen is also electron-withdrawing, so the two protons ortho to it will also be downfield. We expect two signals in the ~7.5-8.0 ppm range.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The compound has a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the carbonyl carbon. These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl ketone (R-C(=O)CH3) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the given options against the prediction.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the 4 aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons in the expected chemical shift range for a methyl ketone.\n        *   This option is a perfect match for the structure of para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Incorrect number of aromatic protons and incorrect splitting. The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too far upfield for a typical aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n        *   The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` does not match the expected methyl singlet. This option describes a different compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is the only choice that is fully consistent with all the information provided for a di-substituted C8 aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Parent Structure**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄). This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring.\n*   **Total Carbons**: The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups**: The FTIR data reveals two key functional groups:\n    1.  A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    2.  An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n*   **Substituents**: Based on the functional groups, one substituent on the benzene ring is a halogen atom (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon. Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl-containing Substituent**: The most common and stable substituent containing two carbons and a carbonyl group is the **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n*   **Final Structure**: Combining these pieces of information, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions. The provided NMR data options will help determine the specific arrangement. Let's analyze the expected signals for a haloacetophenone (C₆H₄(X)(COCH₃)):\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**: There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern will depend on the substitution pattern. They typically appear in the range of 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃)**: There are 3 protons in the acetyl group's methyl group. Since this methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and not to any carbon with protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Its chemical shift is typically around **2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Given NMR Options\n\n**A) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n*   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. This would imply the structure is a halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). While this structure also has 8 carbons, the multiplicity is incorrect. The -CH₂- and -CHO protons would couple, leading to a doublet and a triplet, not two singlets.\n\n**B) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n*   The chemical shifts around 4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons, which are typically found above 6.5 ppm. This option is inconsistent with an aromatic structure.\n\n**C) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n*   Similar to option B, the signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The methyl singlet at 1.3 ppm is too shielded (upfield) for an acetyl group, which is typically found around 2.5 ppm.\n\n**D) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are a classic pattern for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The two pairs of chemically non-equivalent protons split each other into doublets. The chemical shifts are in the expected range for an aromatic ring with two electron-withdrawing groups.\n*   **Aliphatic Region**: The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H perfectly matches the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n*   **Overall Consistency**: This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. It accounts for the correct number of protons (4 aromatic + 3 methyl = 7 total), correct multiplicities (two doublets and a singlet), and plausible chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data in option D precisely describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone, which fits all the criteria given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound, a step-by-step structural elucidation is necessary based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Deducing the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms. The most common and stable structure fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This group has exactly two carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Isomers and Predicting NMR Spectra**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as three possible isomers: ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-). The 1H NMR splitting pattern is highly dependent on this substitution.\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-Isomers:** These isomers are unsymmetrical. They would show complex splitting patterns in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Para-Isomer:** This isomer (e.g., 4'-haloacetophenone) is symmetrical about the axis passing through both substituents. This symmetry results in a much simpler 1H NMR spectrum:\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the halogen are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   This leads to two distinct signals in the aromatic region, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. Each doublet would integrate to 2H.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is isolated and has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3H.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the NMR Data Options**\n\nLet's compare the predicted spectrum for the para-isomer with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, and a singlet for 3 protons. This pattern perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone**. The reported chemical shifts are also consistent; for example, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4'-Bromoacetophenone is reported as δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61(d, 2H), 2.57 (s, 3H). Similarly, 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.43 (d, 2H), 2.59 (s, 3H).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This contradicts the acetyl group structure. Also, a 3H singlet for the methyl group is absent.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This data does not correspond to a di-substituted benzene ring. The signals and splitting patterns are inconsistent with an aromatic structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), indicating it is not an aromatic compound.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option that correctly represents the 1H NMR data for the described compound (a para-haloacetophenone) is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo identify the correct 1H NMR data, we must first deduce the structure of the compound from the given information.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Core Structure:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6). It is di-substituted and contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This leaves two carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n2.  **Functional Groups from FTIR:** The FTIR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\n3.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nNow, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options. The molecule has two sets of protons: those on the aromatic ring and those on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3H. Their chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Their chemical shift is in the aromatic region, typically 6.5-8.0 ppm. The splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm). The peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too far upfield. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Similar to A, this option does not show a pattern consistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. The integration of 2H for a singlet at 1.3 ppm is also unusual for the proposed structure. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two signals in the aromatic region, `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons more significantly than the halogen, which accounts for the two distinct doublets. For example, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows doublets at approximately 7.9 ppm and 7.4 ppm. Likewise, 4-bromoacetophenone shows doublets around 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons:** The signal `2.3 (3H, s)` is a singlet integrating to three protons at a chemical shift consistent with a methyl group next to a carbonyl.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest a different structure, such as a *para*-halophenylacetaldehyde (-CH2CHO substituent). However, in such a structure, the methylene protons (-CH2-) and the aldehyde proton (-CHO) are adjacent and would split each other, resulting in a doublet and a triplet, respectively. Since the data shows two singlets, this option is inconsistent with the expected splitting patterns.\n\nBased on this analysis, the data in option C is the only one that correctly represents the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct structure and its corresponding 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. This leaves 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring itself.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR peak for a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **FTIR peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X):** The other substituent is a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br) directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: two carbons and one oxygen in a carbonyl group. The only possible arrangement for a C₂ substituent with a carbonyl group attached to a ring is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n3.  **Consider the isomerism (ortho, meta, para):**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will be simplest for the most symmetrical isomer, which is the *para* (1,4) substituted compound. A *para*-disubstituted ring with two different substituents will show two distinct signals for the aromatic protons. Due to symmetry, the two protons next to substituent A are equivalent, and the two protons next to substituent B are equivalent. These two groups of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex splitting patterns, not two simple doublets.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (around 7.0-8.0 ppm):** We expect to see two signals, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, and both appearing as doublets. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be the most downfield (highest ppm value).\n        *   A doublet for 2H around 7.8 ppm.\n        *   A doublet for the other 2H slightly more upfield, around 7.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** We have a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a carbonyl. This methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with, so it will appear as a singlet. It will integrate to 3 hydrogens. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   A singlet for 3H around 2.3 ppm.\n\n5.  **Compare the prediction with the given options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This perfectly matches our prediction: two doublets in the aromatic region for a *para*-substituted ring and a singlet for a methyl ketone group.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde, not a ketone. An aldehyde would only have 7 total carbons (p-halobenzaldehyde), which contradicts the problem statement.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals are not in the correct region for an aromatic compound of this type, and the integration (1H + 2H + 2H on the ring) is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nThe correct 1H NMR data corresponds to a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound, we must first deduce its structure based on the given information.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (6 carbons).\n*   **Di-substituted:** There are two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group:** A C=O group is present.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. A chemically stable and common group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The base structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Options:\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given ¹H NMR data to see which one matches the predicted structure of a haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Expected features of a haloacetophenone spectrum:**\n    *   A signal for the methyl (CH₃) protons of the acetyl group. This should be a singlet (s) integrating to 3 hydrogens (3H), typically in the range of 2.0-2.7 ppm.\n    *   Signals for the aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted ring, there will be 4 aromatic protons. Their splitting pattern will depend on whether the substitution is ortho, meta, or para. A para (1,4) substitution often leads to a symmetrical pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. The chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm). Electron-withdrawing groups like a carbonyl and a halogen will shift these protons downfield.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, which is highly characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also features a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n        *   Spectral data for known para-haloacetophenones like 4-chloroacetophenone (δ ~7.9 (d, 2H), ~7.4 (d, 2H), 2.6 (s, 3H)) and 4-bromoacetophenone (δ ~7.8 (d, 2H), ~7.6 (d, 2H), 2.6 (s, 3H)) are very similar to this option. This is a strong match.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data is inconsistent. It lacks the typical aromatic signals in the 7-8 ppm range and the characteristic 3H singlet for a methyl ketone. The signals at ~4.7 ppm and a 2H singlet are not expected.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic proton region (6.5-8.0 ppm), which contradicts the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (p-halophenylacetaldehyde, X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), it would also have 8 carbons and fit the general description. However, this option does not contain the 3H singlet expected from the more common acetyl group (-COCH₃) structure which is a ketone. While p-halophenylacetaldehyde is a possibility, the spectrum for p-bromo-phenylacetaldehyde is reported as δ 9.70 (t, 1H), 7.50 (d, 2H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). The splitting of the aldehyde and methylene protons in this literature data (triplet and doublet, respectively) does not match the singlets described in option D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOption A provides the most accurate and consistent ¹H NMR data for a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen, which is best identified as a para-haloacetophenone. The two doublets in the aromatic region and the 3-proton singlet for the methyl ketone are the key identifying features.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Features:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. This means the two substituents together must contain 2 additional carbons (8 total - 6 ring = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR...carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's call it 'X'.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is `-X` (a halogen). This substituent has 0 carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons AND the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible structures for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group:\n        *   **Acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)**: This has two carbons and a carbonyl. This is a very common and stable substituent.\n        *   **2-Oxoethyl group (`-CH₂CHO`)**: This also has two carbons and a carbonyl (an aldehyde). This is another possibility.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Molecular Structures and Predict their ¹H NMR Spectra:**\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Acetyl group + Halogen on a benzene ring.**\n        *   Structure: Haloacetophenone. The most symmetrical arrangement is `para` (1,4-substitution), which would be **4-halo-acetophenone**.\n        *   Let's predict the ¹H NMR for 4-halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃):\n            *   **Aromatic Protons**: The `para` substitution creates symmetry. There will be two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. This gives a characteristic pattern of two doublets (`2H, d` and `2H, d`). The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be downfield (higher ppm, ~7.8-8.0 ppm). The protons closer to the halogen will be slightly more upfield (~7.5-7.7 ppm).\n            *   **Acetyl Protons**: The methyl group (`-CH₃`) is next to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so it will be a singlet (`s`). It will have an integration of `3H`. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.8 ppm (2H, d), ~7.6 ppm (2H, d), ~2.3 ppm (3H, s).\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: 2-Oxoethyl group + Halogen on a benzene ring.**\n        *   Structure: Halo-phenylacetaldehyde. Again, let's assume a `para` substitution for symmetry: **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Let's predict the ¹H NMR for 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO):\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (`-CHO`)**: This gives a very characteristic signal far downfield (~9.5-10.0 ppm). It's a singlet (`s`) or a triplet (`t`) and integrates to `1H`.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (`-CH₂-`)**: These are adjacent to the aldehyde proton, so they should be split into a doublet (`d`). They integrate to `2H`. The chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n            *   **Aromatic Protons**: Similar to the first case, we'd expect two doublets (`2H, d` and `2H, d`) in the aromatic region (~7.0-7.8 ppm).\n        *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~9.9 ppm (1H, s/t), ~7.8 ppm (2H, d), ~7.6 ppm (2H, d), ~3.7 ppm (2H, d).\n\n4.  **Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum matches our prediction for 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde. It has the aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm, the methylene protons at 3.7 ppm, and the para-substituted aromatic pattern. However, the multiplicity for the `-CH₂CHO` group is given as two singlets (`s`), which is unusual. They should typically couple to form a doublet and a triplet. While not impossible (if the coupling constant is near zero), it is anomalous.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum is a **perfect textbook match** for our prediction for 4-halo-acetophenone. All chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns (multiplicity) are exactly as expected.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. It lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. The integration for the aromatic proton (1H) does not fit a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4H).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both A and B correspond to structures that fit the initial description. However, the spectrum in option B is a classic, unambiguous match for 4-halo-acetophenone. The spectrum in option A represents 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde but with questionable multiplicity. In chemical identification problems, the perfect fit is the intended correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the problem to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n    1.  **Compound requirements:**\n        - Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene with 2 groups).\n        - 8 carbon atoms total.\n        - Contains a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n        - Contains an aromatic-halogen bond (halogen on the ring).\n\n    2.  **Structure Deduction:**\n        - The ring has 6 carbons.

This is a benzene ring with two groups attached.\n*   **Atom Count:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n*   **Summary of deduced facts:** The molecule is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom (-X) and one other group that contains 2 carbon atoms and a carbonyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Propose possible structures**\n\nLet's figure out the substituent that contains 2 carbons and a C=O group.\n*   **Possibility 1: An acetyl group (-COCH₃).** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. If this and a halogen are attached to a benzene ring, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This fits perfectly. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**.\n*   **Possibility 2: A formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO).** This group also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. If this and a halogen are attached to a benzene ring, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (formylmethyl) = 8. This also fits. The resulting compound would be a **halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the general patterns in the NMR options**\n\nLooking at the NMR options, options A and C show a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: `~7.8 (2H, d)` and `~7.6 (2H, d)`.\n*   **What this pattern means:** Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   So, we can confidently assume our compound is a **para-isomer**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the para-isomers of our candidate structures**\n\n*   **Candidate 1: para-Haloacetophenone**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The ring is attached to a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing and is directly attached to the ring. This will strongly *deshield* the aromatic protons, moving their signals far downfield (to a high ppm value). We would expect the two doublets to be in the ~7.5 - 8.0 ppm range.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** There is a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the carbonyl. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Its typical chemical shift is around **2.1 - 2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets between 7.5-8.0 ppm (total 4H), and one singlet around 2.3 ppm (3H).\n\n*   **Candidate 2: para-Halo-phenylacetaldehyde**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is highly deshielded and gives a unique signal very far downfield, typically **9-10 ppm**. It will be a singlet (s) or a triplet (t).\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The methylene protons (-CH₂-) are in a benzylic position (next to the ring). Their signal would be around **3.5 - 4.0 ppm**. It would be a singlet (s) or a doublet (d).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The ring is attached to a halogen (-X) and a -CH₂CHO group. The group directly attached is the -CH₂-, which is not strongly electron-withdrawing. The electronic effect is insulated by the CH₂. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be much less deshielded than in Candidate 1. Their chemical shifts would be expected around **7.1 - 7.4 ppm**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predictions with the given options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This has the aldehyde proton (9.9 ppm) and the methylene proton (3.7 ppm) signals that match Candidate 2 (para-Halo-phenylacetaldehyde).\n    *   **However**, the aromatic proton signals (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield. They do not match a ring substituted with a -CH₂- group. This option has an internal inconsistency.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   These chemical shifts and splitting patterns are not consistent with a di-substituted aromatic compound. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The aromatic signals (`7.8`, `7.6` ppm) are strongly deshielded, which is perfectly consistent with a ring directly attached to an electron-withdrawing acetyl group.\n    *   The aliphatic signal `2.3 (3H, s)` is a perfect match for a methyl ketone (-COCH₃).\n    *   This spectrum is a textbook match for **para-Haloacetophenone (Candidate 1)**. All features are consistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   These are not aromatic chemical shifts. Incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in option C is the only one that is fully consistent with a plausible structure (para-haloacetophenone) that meets all the criteria given in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nAn in-depth analysis of the problem leads to the following conclusion:\n\n1.  **Structure Determination:**\n    *   **Aromatic Core:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it's based on a benzene ring with two substituents (C6H4).\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The total carbon count is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contribute a total of 2 carbons.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is indicated.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The substituents must be a halogen atom (-X, 0 carbons) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl. The most common and stable such group is the acetyl group (-COCH3). Therefore, the molecule is a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n\n2.  **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   For a haloacetophenone, there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group, totaling **7 protons**.\n    *   The most symmetrical isomer is the **para-substituted** (1,4) isomer. This symmetry would simplify the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum into two signals, each being a **doublet** (due to splitting from a single adjacent proton) and each integrating to **2H**. These signals appear in the aromatic region (~7-8 ppm).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl, which has no protons. Thus, its signal will be a **singlet** and integrate to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s):** Incorrect. This spectrum lacks the classic aromatic pattern and a 3H singlet for a methyl group.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s):** Incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3).\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s):** **Correct.** This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for a para-haloacetophenone. It has two 2H doublets in the aromatic region (7.6 and 7.8 ppm) and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, consistent with a methyl ketone. The total proton count is 2+2+3 = 7.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s):** Incorrect. This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) and is therefore inconsistent with the structure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that matches the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound, let's break down the given information and analyze the possible structure.\n\n### **1. Structural Analysis**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbons.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O) present:** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond present:** A halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the most plausible structure is a halo-acetophenone. This consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This structure has the required C₆ ring, a C₂ substituent containing a carbonyl (acetyl group), for a total of 8 carbons.\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. A para-substituted ring is highly symmetrical and gives a characteristic, simple ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Predicting the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for a **para-halo-acetophenone** (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone):\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing 2 hydrogens. These signals appear as doublets due to splitting by their neighbors. They are located in the downfield region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm) because of the deshielding effect of the aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing acetyl group.\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not to any other protons. Therefore, it will appear as a singlet (a single peak with no splitting). This signal will integrate to 3 hydrogens and typically appears around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\nSo, the predicted spectrum is: two doublets in the aromatic region (each for 2H) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (for 3H).\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    This option does not fit. The integration (number of hydrogens) and signal locations do not match an aromatic ketone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    This spectrum is a perfect match for a para-halo-acetophenone. It shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is characteristic of para-substitution. The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group. The total hydrogen count (2+2+3=7) is correct for C₈H₇XO.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This would correspond to a halo-phenylacetaldehyde. However, the methylene (-CH₂) and aldehyde (-CHO) protons should show coupling (doublet and triplet, respectively), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This option lacks any signals in the aromatic proton region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), which immediately disqualifies it since the compound is defined as aromatic.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data presented in option B is fully consistent with the structure of a para-halo-acetophenone, which satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo identify the correct ¹H NMR data, we must first deduce the most likely structure of the compound based on the information provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Compound's Structure:\n1.  **Core Structure**: A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring implies a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄).\n2.  **Total Carbons**: The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR)**:\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n### Deducing the Substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most plausible and common structure for a C₂-carbonyl substituent is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n\nCombining these parts, the most probable structure is a **haloacetophenone**. Assuming a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which leads to a simple and symmetrical NMR spectrum, a likely candidate is 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone.\n\n### Predicting the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Haloacetophenone:\nA para-substituted haloacetophenone has two sets of protons:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons**: Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, there are two distinct types of aromatic protons. Each type is adjacent to the other, resulting in two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm). Since there are four protons on the ring in total, each doublet will integrate to 2H.\n2.  **Methyl Protons**: The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will appear as a singlet. This signal is typically found in the 2.0-3.0 ppm range.\n\nSo, the predicted spectrum is: two doublets (each 2H) and one singlet (3H).\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals are not in the typical aromatic region and the integration and splitting patterns do not match our predicted structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for a para-substituted haloacetophenone. It has two doublets in the aromatic region integrating to 2H each (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) and a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm (`2.3 (3H, s)`). This is confirmed by spectral data for compounds like 4-chloroacetophenone, which shows a singlet for the methyl group around 2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), which contradicts the compound being an aromatic ring.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Decoding the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents. This ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl group:** One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and a two-carbon chain containing a carbonyl group. The most plausible structure for the second substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This leads to a haloacetophenone molecule. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Potential 1H NMR Spectra\n\nThe two substituents, a halogen and an acetyl group, can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. Let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each, focusing on the `para`-isomer (1,4-dihaloacetophenone), as it often results in a simpler, more recognizable spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** `para`-haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** Due to the symmetry of a para-substituted ring, the four aromatic protons are divided into two equivalent sets. This typically results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet, and each integrating to 2H. These signals are found in the aromatic region, generally between 6.5-8.0 ppm.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will appear as a singlet (a single unsplit peak). The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This option does not match our predicted structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have four). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`:** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring. The signals are in the correct aromatic region.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`:** This is a singlet representing three protons at a chemical shift characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for `para`-haloacetophenone. For example, the reported spectrum of 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows doublets around 7.89 and 7.43 ppm, and a singlet for the methyl group at 2.59 ppm, which is very close to the values in this option.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm) and is therefore incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data in option C is the only one that correctly represents a di-substituted, 8-carbon aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and a halogen. The structure is specifically a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for the ring part is C6H4.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\":** The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\":** One of the substituents contains a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\":** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\nCombining these facts:\n*   One substituent is -X.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and simple group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\nNow, we must consider the substitution pattern: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Options Based on the Deduced Structure:**\n\nThe general structure is a haloacetophenone. Let's predict the expected 1H NMR signals:\n*   An **acetyl group (-COCH3)** will show up as a **singlet** (since there are no adjacent protons) integrating to **3H**, typically in the chemical shift range of **δ 2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n*   The **aromatic protons** (4H on the C6H4 ring) will appear in the **δ 7.0-8.0 ppm** region. The splitting pattern will depend on the substitution (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Para (1,4) substitution:** Due to the symmetry, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This results in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) or Meta (1,3) substitution:** These isomers lack the symmetry of the para isomer and would produce a more complex pattern with up to four distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 7-8 ppm). The signals at δ 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are incorrect for protons on a benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** We see two doublets at δ 7.8 and 7.6, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** We see a singlet at δ 2.3, integrating to 3H. This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons (making them appear further downfield, ~δ 7.8) relative to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. While this is a carbonyl group, the problem also states there is an *aromatic-halogen bond*. A structure like p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde would fit the carbon count and NMR signals, but the halogen would be on a methyl group (aliphatic), not the aromatic ring. Thus, this option contradicts the given information.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring. The signals at δ 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic proton region, and the integration (2H singlet for what should be a 3H methyl) is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only structure that fits all the descriptive information (8 carbons, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl, aromatic-halogen bond) is a **para-haloacetophenone**. The NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: The other substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X) and a second substituent that contains 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   The most straightforward and common chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This group has exactly 2 carbons and one carbonyl.\n    *   Let's check the total carbon count with this structure: 6 carbons (ring) + 2 carbons (acetyl group) = 8 carbons. This matches the information given.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular structure is a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Consider the Possible Isomers and Predict their 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n    *   The molecule has a total of 7 protons: 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers:** In these isomers, all 4 aromatic protons would be in different chemical environments, leading to a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not simple doublets.\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This isomer (4-haloacetophenone) has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n        *   This results in a characteristic splitting pattern in the aromatic region: **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is electron-withdrawing, so it will deshield the protons ortho to it, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield).\n        *   The halogen is also electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will also be downfield. We expect the aromatic protons to be in the range of ~7.3-8.0 ppm.\n        *   The methyl protons (-CH3) are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which deshields them. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**, integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone:** Aromatic region with two doublets (2H each) and an aliphatic region with one singlet (3H).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure that would fit this data is 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO), which also has 8 carbons. However, the aromatic protons in this compound would be expected at a lower chemical shift (around 7.2-7.3 ppm) because the -CH2CHO group is less electron-withdrawing than a directly attached -COCH3 group. The high shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) make this option inconsistent.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data does not show the expected pattern for a disubstituted benzene ring (typically 4 protons in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This data lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The integration (2H + 2H = 4H) is correct for the aromatic protons.\n        *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm, which is perfectly characteristic of a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl** (-COCH3).\n        *   The total proton count is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which matches our derived structure.\n        *   This spectrum is a textbook match for a **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a 4-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option D perfectly matches the expected spectrum for this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process used to solve this problem.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the Information to Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the molecule's core is a benzene ring that has two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The entire molecule has 8 carbons. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the functional groups on the molecule is a carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This confirms that one of the substituents is a halogen atom (like F, Cl, Br, or I) that is bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the Molecular Structure from the Deduced Pieces**\n\n*   Substituent 1 is a halogen (-X). A halogen atom contains 0 carbons.\n*   Substituent 2 must therefore contain all of the remaining atoms: the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only stable and common structure for this is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Combining these pieces, the molecule must be a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for a Haloacetophenone**\n\nNow, we need to think about what the 1H NMR spectrum of this molecule would look like. We consider the different types of protons and their expected signals.\n\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃)**:\n    *   There are 3 protons in this group.\n    *   They are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, their signal will not be split by any neighboring protons.\n    *   This will result in a **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**.\n    *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-)**:\n    *   There are 4 protons on the disubstituted ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of these protons is a key clue to the substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n    *   For a ***para* (1,4) substitution**, the molecule is symmetrical. This high degree of symmetry results in a characteristic and simple pattern: **two doublets (d)**, where each doublet represents **2H**.\n    *   For *ortho* or *meta* substitution, the protons are less symmetrical, leading to more complex splitting patterns that would not be described as two simple doublets.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options**\n\nWe will now compare our prediction (a 3H singlet ~2.3 ppm and two 2H doublets in the aromatic region) with the choices.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl methyl group (a singlet, integrating to 3H, at the correct chemical shift).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 hydrogens, is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **This option is fully consistent with the structure of *p*-haloacetophenone.**\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. The compound also lacks the required 3H singlet. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A disubstituted benzene ring must have 4 protons in the aromatic region (typically >6.5 ppm). This spectrum does not show this. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic proton region. It cannot represent an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only data set that matches all the features deduced from the problem description is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two other groups (substituents) attached to it.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak indicates a **carbonyl group (C=O)**.\n    *   A peak indicates an **aromatic-halogen bond (C-X)**, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Identify the Substituents and Propose a Structure:**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    1.  A halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    2.  A group containing the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's find a group with the formula C₂ and C=O. The most common and stable such group is the **acetyl group**, -C(=O)CH₃.\n*   Combining these pieces, the molecule is a **halo-acetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n    *   This structure has a di-substituted benzene ring. (✓)\n    *   It has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 total carbons. (✓)\n    *   It has a carbonyl group. (✓)\n    *   It has an aromatic-halogen bond. (✓)\n    *   The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means it should have 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the ring, 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**3. Analyze the Possible Isomers and Predict their ¹H NMR Spectra:**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can have three positional isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-isomers:** These isomers are asymmetric. They would have four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region (typically four separate signals with complex splitting like doublets, triplets, etc.).\n*   **Para-isomer:** The para-halo-acetophenone (4-halo-acetophenone) is highly symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-C4 axis.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs. The two protons next to the acetyl group (Hₐ) are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen (Hₑ) are equivalent.\n    *   The Hₐ protons will couple with their adjacent Hₑ protons, appearing as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The Hₑ protons will couple with their adjacent Hₐ protons, appearing as another **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will not be split and will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n\n*   **Predicted ¹H NMR Spectrum for para-halo-acetophenone:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~7.5-8.0 ppm): One doublet (2H) and another doublet (2H).\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.0-2.5 ppm): One singlet (3H).\n    *   Total protons: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and a singlet in the aliphatic region for 3H.\n    *   The chemical shifts are appropriate: ~7.7 ppm for aromatic protons next to electron-withdrawing groups and ~2.3 ppm for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH₃).\n    *   This data is a perfect match for the predicted spectrum of **para-halo-acetophenone**.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest a structure like para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which also fits the initial description.\n    *   However, in such a structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) should be split by the adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-), appearing as a triplet (t). Similarly, the methylene protons should be split by the aldehyde proton, appearing as a doublet (d). The data lists both as singlets (s), which is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons, which typically appear above 6.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not one. The chemical shifts are also not characteristic of the proposed aromatic structure. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting all the given criteria is A. The compound is a para-halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms total:** A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contribute a total of 2 carbons.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   Based on the constraints, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and the remaining two carbon atoms. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these parts, the molecule is a halo-acetophenone. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substitution Pattern and its NMR Signature:**\n    *   The problem describes a di-substituted ring, which can be ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-). The ¹H NMR splitting pattern of the aromatic protons is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution** would result in four distinct and complex signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Meta-substitution** would also result in complex patterns, typically with four signals (or three if one proton is uniquely isolated).\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4-)** is the most symmetrical. It creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring. This results in two signals, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), which appear as doublets due to coupling with their single adjacent proton. This \"two doublets, each 2H\" pattern is highly characteristic of para-substitution.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the ¹H NMR Data Options:**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `7.8 ppm (2H, d)` and `7.6 ppm (2H, d)` are in the aromatic region and perfectly match the pattern for a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH₃) and the halogen are both electron-withdrawing, which shifts the aromatic protons downfield (greater than 7 ppm). The protons closer to the strongly withdrawing carbonyl group would be further downfield (around 7.8 ppm) than those closer to the halogen (around 7.6 ppm).\n        *   The signal at `2.3 ppm (3H, s)` corresponds to the three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) in the acetyl substituent. It is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with. Its chemical shift is typical for a methyl ketone.\n        *   This data is fully consistent with a 4'-haloacetophenone structure. For example, published data for 4'-chloroacetophenone shows peaks at δ 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.43 (d, 2H), and 2.59 (s, 3H), and data for 4'-bromoacetophenone shows peaks at δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), and 2.57 (s, 3H). The values in option A are very close to these experimental values.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts are too low for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals and their integrations do not match an aromatic compound with an acetyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 ppm` is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. An aldehyde-containing compound that fits the C8 and halogen requirement, such as a halomethylbenzaldehyde, would not have the specified aromatic-halogen bond. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only ¹H NMR data that correctly represents the structure of a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond (specifically a 4'-haloacetophenone) is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a detailed analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Molecular Clues\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. This leaves four protons on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** A benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 substituent C).\n*   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n*   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (like F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n### Step 2: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\nLet's combine the clues to build the molecule:\n*   We need two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and both substituents together must have a total of two carbon atoms.\n*   Since the halogen itself has no carbons, the carbonyl-containing substituent must have exactly two carbons.\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group. The total carbon count is 6 (benzene ring) + 2 (acetyl group) = 8, which matches the description.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Potential Isomers and their 1H NMR Spectra\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can have three possible arrangements: ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-isomers:** These arrangements are unsymmetrical and would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely appearing as complex multiplets.\n*   **Para-isomer:** The 1,4-substitution pattern is symmetrical. This symmetry results in a much simpler 1H NMR spectrum for the aromatic region. The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent in two sets of two. This typically gives rise to two distinct signals, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), and each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Given 1H NMR Options\n\nNow, let's compare the predicted spectra with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets (d) at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H, are the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet (s) at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3H, is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a carbonyl, as in an acetyl group. The chemical shift is in the expected range.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This data perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. For example, published data for 4-chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.90 (d, 2H), 7.44 (d, 2H), and 2.59 (s, 3H), and for 4-bromoacetophenone at δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), and 2.57 (s, 3H). The data in option A is highly consistent with these known values.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum suggests a para-substituted ring with an aldehyde group (δ 9.9 ppm) and a -CH₂- group (δ 3.7 ppm). This would correspond to a para-halophenylacetaldehyde. However, the methylene (-CH₂-) protons and the aldehyde (-CHO) proton would be coupled, leading to a doublet and a triplet respectively, not two singlets. This option is incorrect due to the splitting pattern.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons. This option only shows one proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with the required structure.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only option that correctly describes the compound is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the given information and then predict its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **1. Molecular Structure Determination**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The FTIR data shows the presence of a carbonyl group. This group accounts for one carbon atom.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** The FTIR data also indicates a halogen atom is directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\nBased on this, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A substituent containing one carbonyl group and the remaining carbon atom. This forms an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nThe molecule is therefore a haloacetophenone. The general formula is C₈H₇XO, which fits the provided information.\n\n### **2. ¹H NMR Spectrum Prediction**\n\nNow, we need to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. Let's consider the possible substitution patterns (ortho, meta, para) on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This group has three equivalent protons on the methyl group. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)**, integrating to **3H**. Due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group, its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.0–2.7 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** The benzene ring has four protons. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution:** Would result in four distinct and complex signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Meta-substitution:** Would also result in four distinct and complex signals.\n    *   **Para-substitution:** This pattern is highly symmetric. The four aromatic protons are present as two chemically equivalent sets. This leads to a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2H**. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are expected to be further downfield than the protons ortho to the halogen.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's compare our predictions with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). The singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl group next to a carbonyl. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Again, the signals are not in the expected regions, and the integration (2H singlet) does not match a methyl group. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a methyl ketone. The 2H singlet at 3.7 ppm is also inconsistent with an acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This signal perfectly matches the acetyl methyl group—a singlet integrating to 3H in the correct chemical shift region.\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for an aromatic ring substituted with an acetyl group and a halogen. For example, the ¹H NMR spectrum of 4-chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.57 (d, 2H), 7.09 (d, 2H), and 2.28 (s, 3H). While the exact shifts vary, the pattern described in option D is characteristic and correct.\n\nTherefore, the data in option D corresponds to a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information and candidate responses.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must deduce the structure of the unknown compound from the given description:\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached (a C₆H₄ core). A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is present in one of the substituents.\n*   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\nCombining these facts:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains 0 carbons.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow, we need to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The two substituents can be in the *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* position. For multiple-choice questions of this type, the most symmetrical isomer, **para (1,4)-substitution**, is most likely as it gives the simplest and most characteristic spectrum.\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone**:\n*   **Acetyl Group (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** A para-substituted ring is symmetrical. This results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons. These two sets split each other, producing a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. Both the acetyl group and the halogen are electron-withdrawing, so the aromatic protons will be shifted downfield into the 7.0-8.0 ppm range.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our predicted spectrum against the choices provided in the question prompt:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone. It shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and a 3H singlet at a chemical shift appropriate for a methyl ketone. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical chemical shift range for aromatic protons (which is >6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows 1H in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH₃).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data in option A is the only choice that correctly represents this structure, with the characteristic two doublets for a para-substituted aromatic ring and a singlet for the acetyl methyl group.

Deduce the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the two substituents are:\n1.

A group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nThe only common and stable 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\nSince it is a di-substituted ring, the substituents can be in the ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) position. Let's analyze the expected 1H NMR for these possibilities, focusing on the most symmetrical case first, which often appears in such problems.\n\n*   **Para-substituted (1,4-haloacetophenone):** This structure is symmetrical.\n    *   There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be one signal (a doublet).\n    *   The two protons ortho to the halogen will be another signal (a doublet).\n    *   The methyl protons (-CH3) of the acetyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so they will appear as a singlet integrating to 3H.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields its ortho protons more strongly (higher ppm value) than the halogen does. This pattern fits perfectly.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3H, is characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (-COCH3).\n    *   This data is fully consistent with the structure of a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would imply the 2-carbon substituent is -CH2CHO.\n    *   However, in a -CH2CHO group, the aldehyde proton (CHO) should be split by the adjacent methylene protons (CH2), appearing as a triplet. The data shows a singlet (1H, s). This is a significant inconsistency. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum does not show the expected pattern for a di-substituted benzene ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons). The signals are also in unusual regions for this type of compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B is the only one that accurately represents the 1H NMR spectrum of a compound that fits all the given criteria: a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo identify the correct 1H NMR data, let's first determine the possible structure of the compound based on the given information.\n\n### **Structural Analysis**\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The compound is based on a benzene ring with two substituents.\n2.  **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms, which means the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n4.  **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the halogen is one substituent, and the other substituent must contain two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable structure that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). To have the simplest and most distinct NMR spectrum presented in the options, a para (1,4) substitution pattern is the most likely arrangement.\n\nThe proposed structure is **p-haloacetophenone** (for example, 4-chloroacetophenone).\n\n### **1H NMR Prediction and Analysis of Options**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a p-haloacetophenone and compare it with the given choices.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-substituted benzene ring, the protons are split into two distinct sets. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent protons (ortho to the acetyl group), causing them to appear downfield (at a higher ppm value). The halogen is also electron-withdrawing. This pattern typically results in two doublets in the aromatic region (usually between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm). Since there are four protons on the ring, we expect to see a 2H doublet and another 2H doublet.\n*   **Methyl Protons:** The acetyl group's methyl protons (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a singlet. This signal is expected to have an integration of 3H and a chemical shift of around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct data for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   It also shows a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is the expected chemical shift and multiplicity for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a p-haloacetophenone. For instance, the actual reported shifts for 4-chloroacetophenone are approximately 7.90 ppm (d, 2H), 7.45 ppm (d, 2H), and 2.55 ppm (s, 3H), which is in very close agreement with this option.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, but this option shows only one proton in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deciphering the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n\nLet's combine these facts:\n*   Substituent 1: A halogen atom (-X). This has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   Substituent 2: Must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nSo, the compound is a halo-acetophenone.\n\n**2. Determining the Substitution Pattern from NMR Data:**\n\nThe problem states the ring is di-substituted, which means the two groups can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. Let's look at the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) of the NMR options:\n\n*   **A)** 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> Two signals, each representing 2 protons. This symmetry (two sets of two equivalent protons) is characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution**.\n*   **B)** No signals in the aromatic region. Incorrect.\n*   **C)** One signal for 1 proton. Incorrect for a di-substituted ring.\n*   **D)** 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) -> Also indicates a **para (1,4) substitution**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **para-haloacetophenone** (or 4-haloacetophenone).\n\n**3. Predicting the Full 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nNow let's predict the full spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone and compare it with options A and D.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons**: We've established this will be two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the 7-8 ppm range. Both A and D match this.\n*   **Substituent Protons**: The only other protons are in the acetyl group's methyl (-CH₃).\n    *   These 3 protons are on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group, but not adjacent to any other proton-bearing carbon.\n    *   Therefore, they should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (R-CO-CH₃) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Options:**\n\n*   **Option A**: `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`\n    *   Aromatic part: Matches the para-substitution pattern.\n    *   Aliphatic part: `2.3 (3H, s)` perfectly matches the predicted signal for the acetyl methyl group in terms of chemical shift, integration (3H), and splitting (singlet). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option D**: `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`\n    *   This option has a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. It also lacks the 3H singlet for the methyl group. This does not match our deduced structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a 4-haloacetophenone, and its 1H NMR spectrum is correctly described by option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical information to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n    1.  **Analyze the compound description:**\n        - Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring: A benzene ring with two groups.\n        - 8 total carbon atoms: 6 in the ring, 2 in the substituents.\n        - FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\n\n    2.  **Deduce the structure:**\n        - One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n        - The other must have 2 carbons and a C=O group.

A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Deduce the possible structure of the compound.**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   A 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl (C=O) is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).**\n\n*   We need to look at the patterns in the aromatic region of the provided 1H NMR options.\n*   Options A and C both show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (e.g., `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`).\n*   This specific pattern (two doublets of equal integration) is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and they split each other into two doublets.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** As established, the para-substitution will result in two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm). Each doublet will integrate to 2H. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than those closer to the halogen.\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the methyl protons will not be split and will appear as a **singlet**. This signal will integrate to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl ketone (Ar-COCH₃) is around **2.0-2.7 ppm**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. The peak at 3.7 ppm is for 2H, not 3H. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the correct range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the four protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm, which is exactly what is expected for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n    *   This option is a perfect match for our deduced structure of 4-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the correct range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that matches all the structural features derived from the problem description is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided about the compound to determine its chemical structure.\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the compound has a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. The core formula is C6H4.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group (C=O).\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\nNow, let's piece this information together:\n*   We have two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The only common chemical group that fits this description (2 carbons, 1 carbonyl) is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure perfectly matches all the given criteria.\n\n**2. Predict the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow that we have the structure, we can predict what its 1H NMR spectrum should look like. A haloacetophenone molecule has two main sets of protons:\n\n*   **The Acetyl Methyl Protons (-COCH3)**: These three protons are on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically in the range of **2.0-2.6 ppm**, and the signal will integrate to **3H**.\n*   **The Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**: There are four protons on the benzene ring. Their chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region, typically **7.0-8.5 ppm**. The splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**3. Analyze the Given NMR Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our prediction.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This is a perfect match for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two signals in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **para (1,4-) disubstituted** benzene ring. This high degree of symmetry is expected for a para-isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The chemical shifts are incorrect for the proposed structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde, its substituents would be -CHO and a halogen -X. This structure (X-C6H4-CHO) only has 7 carbon atoms, which contradicts the given information of 8 total carbons.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. For example, a 1H singlet in the aromatic region is not expected for this type of compound.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The key features are the 3H singlet for the acetyl group and the characteristic pattern of two 2H doublets in the aromatic region, indicating a para-substituted ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆H₄). This accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This leaves 2 carbons for the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This means one substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I), and the other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the remaining two carbons.\n*   **Substituents:** The halogen substituent has zero carbon atoms. Therefore, the second substituent must contain both carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Compound Identity:** The compound is a haloacetophenone (C₈H₇XO).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Substitution Pattern and Expected NMR\n\nThe two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n\n*   **Acetyl Group Signal:** The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) in the acetyl substituent are equivalent and not coupled to any other protons. They will appear as a sharp **singlet (s)**, integrating to 3H, typically in the chemical shift range of 2-3 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Proton Signals:**\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4):** This arrangement is symmetrical. There are two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a simple pattern of **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm), with each doublet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution (1,2):** This arrangement is unsymmetrical, and all four aromatic protons are chemically different. This would lead to a complex pattern of four signals, likely multiplets, in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Meta-substitution (1,3):** This arrangement is also unsymmetrical and would produce a more complex spectrum than the para isomer, likely with four distinct signals.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare the predicted spectra with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is characteristic of an acetyl group's methyl protons.\n    *   It also shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons. This pattern is the hallmark of a para-substituted (1,4) benzene ring.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **p-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows a singlet at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets at ~7.45 ppm and ~7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4'-Bromoacetophenone shows a singlet at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets at ~7.6 ppm and ~7.8 ppm. The values in option A are consistent with these known compounds.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks the characteristic 3H singlet for an acetyl group and the typical aromatic signals. The chemical shifts are not in the expected range for this type of compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   While there is a 3H singlet, its chemical shift (1.3 ppm) is too low for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. The other signals are not in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. An aldehyde would not fit the 8-carbon total with the remaining signals. This option does not match the deduced structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data presented in option A is the only one that correctly represents the signals for such a structure: a singlet for the acetyl methyl group and two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) is directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   Based on the criteria, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these gives the molecular formula C₈H₇XO and the structure of a haloacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The problem describes a di-substituted ring. The relative positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the pattern of the signals in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Para (1,4) substitution:** This arrangement is symmetrical. It would produce two distinct signals for the aromatic protons, with each signal integrating to 2 protons (2H). Due to coupling with adjacent protons, these signals would appear as doublets.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) substitution:** This arrangement is asymmetrical and would result in four separate signals for the four aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H with more complex splitting.\n    *   **Meta (1,3) substitution:** This is also an asymmetrical arrangement that would produce four distinct 1H signals in the aromatic region.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. While a structure like p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde has 8 carbons and a carbonyl, the halogen is not directly attached to the aromatic ring, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option also lacks the characteristic signals for a di-substituted benzene ring and is therefore incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are a classic sign of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is characteristic of the methyl protons in an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-Bromoacetophenone is: δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61(d, 2H), 2.57 (s, 3H). Similarly, the spectrum for 4-Chloroacetophenone is: δ 7.91 (d, 2H), 7.45 (d, 2H), 2.61 (s, 3H). The data in option D is highly consistent with these known compounds.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the NMR data in option D is the only one that correctly represents a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆).\n    *   It is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   The total carbon count is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbons.\n    *   FTIR data confirms a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the ring).\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). This substituent has 0 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and both of the remaining 2 carbons. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its structure is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data Options:**\n    *   The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This molecule has protons on the aromatic ring (4H) and protons on the methyl group (3H).\n    *   Protons on an aromatic ring typically appear in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   The protons of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group) typically appear as a singlet around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This would correspond to a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which is an isomer. However, the description of the methylene (-CH₂) and aldehyde (-CHO) protons as singlets is generally inaccurate, as they would couple to each other.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts are mostly outside the typical aromatic proton region. This data does not match an aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region, `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet at `2.3 (3H, s)`. A singlet integrating to three protons in this chemical shift region is perfectly characteristic of an acetyl methyl group (-COCH₃).\n        *   This data is an excellent match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) and cannot be correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option C accurately describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone, which fits all the conditions given in the problem description.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by two other groups (substituents). The formula for this core is -C6H4-.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: A carbonyl group is a C=O double bond.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents attached directly to the aromatic ring is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I). Let's denote it as -X.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and all 2 of the remaining carbon atoms.\n*   The most common and stable group that fits this description is the **acetyl group**: -COCH3. It has exactly two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n**3. Consider the Positional Isomers**\n\nThe two substituents (acetyl and halogen) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring:\n*   **ortho (1,2-substitution)**: The groups are on adjacent carbons.\n*   **meta (1,3-substitution)**: The groups are separated by one carbon.\n*   **para (1,4-substitution)**: The groups are on opposite sides of the ring.\n\nThe pattern of signals in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this substitution pattern.\n*   For *ortho* and *meta* substitution, the molecule is asymmetrical. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublets, triplets).\n*   For *para* substitution, the molecule is symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons. This symmetry leads to a much simpler spectrum: two signals, each being a doublet, and each integrating to 2H.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data Options**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for our proposed structure (a haloacetophenone) and compare it with the options.\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. They should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n*   **Aromatic protons (-C6H4-)**: There are 4 protons on the ring. Their chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region, typically **6.5-8.5 ppm**. Both the acetyl group and the halogen are electron-withdrawing, which will shift these protons downfield (to higher ppm values).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on this prediction:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a perfect match for the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift, integration (3H), and splitting (singlet) are all correct.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriately downfield due to the electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This data perfectly matches the structure of a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. An aldehyde group only has one carbon, which contradicts the \"8 carbon atoms in total\" information (C6 ring + C1 aldehyde + C(X) = 7 carbons). Also, there is no 3H singlet for the methyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too far upfield.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Incorrect. This does not represent an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`), whereas a di-substituted benzene ring must have four.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOption A is the only choice that is fully consistent with all the information provided: a di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, a halogen, and the resulting NMR signal patterns for a *para*-substituted acetophenone derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H4) that has two groups attached to it.\n*   **Molecular Formula Constraint:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, one substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n*   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable functional group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond, satisfying all the given conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow, we need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in three different ways on the ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4). The NMR spectrum will reveal the substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Signal 1: The Acetyl Methyl Group (-COCH3)**\n    *   The three protons on this methyl group are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will not be split.\n    *   This will appear as a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   It will integrate to **3H**.\n    *   Its chemical shift is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm** because it's attached to a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: The Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**\n    *   The pattern of these signals depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   ***ortho* or *meta* substitution:** These isomers lack symmetry, resulting in four unique aromatic protons. This would produce a complex set of signals (multiplets), not simple patterns.\n        *   ***para* (1,4) substitution:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is a pair of doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks the key features. There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), and there is no 3H singlet for the acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a methyl ketone. An aldehyde group only has one carbon, which would mean the compound is a C7 species (e.g., p-halobenzaldehyde), contradicting the 8-carbon requirement. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the described aromatic compound. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic ring with a carbonyl and a halogen is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    *   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it is a benzene ring with two substituents (a C₆H₄ core).\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The spectrum shows a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond.\" This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the ring.\n    *   **Assembling the Pieces:** The halogen substituent (-X) contains 0 carbon atoms. Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion on Structure:** The compound is a haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the possible isomers and predict their ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three ways: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **The Acetyl Group Protons:** In all three isomers, the methyl group (-CH₃) is not adjacent to any other protons, so it will always appear as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.2-2.7 ppm.\n    *   **The Aromatic Protons:** The di-substituted ring has 4 protons.\n        *   For *ortho* and *meta* isomers, the molecule is asymmetrical. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely with complex splitting patterns.\n        *   For the ***para* isomer**, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons adjacent to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the halogen equivalent to each other. This symmetry results in a very clean and characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted spectra with the given options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not the methyl protons of a ketone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical chemical shift range for aromatic protons (which is ~6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. It does not show the correct number of aromatic protons, and the singlet at 1.3 ppm integrates to 2H, not the 3H required for a methyl group.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **This is the correct answer.** It perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:\n            *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern of two doublets for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n            *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift that is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the given information to deduce the molecular structure.**\n    *   The compound has a **di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**. This is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is **8**. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)**. This means one substituent is a halogen atom (like -Cl, -Br, etc.) attached directly to the ring, and the other substituent contains the carbonyl group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   Since a halogen atom contains no carbon, the second substituent must be a group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable such group is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO. This molecule has 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure.**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring can have ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) substitution. For multiple-choice questions, the most symmetrical isomer, **para-substitution**, is often used because it gives the simplest, most recognizable spectrum.\n    *   Let's consider the structure of **4-haloacetophenone**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** Due to the symmetry of the para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This results in two signals in the aromatic region (typically > 7.0 ppm). Each signal corresponds to 2 protons and appears as a **doublet** due to splitting by its single neighboring proton. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be shifted significantly downfield (e.g., ~7.8-8.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the halogen will also be downfield (e.g., ~7.5-7.7 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (-CH3):** The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). Since the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons, this signal will be a **singlet**. It will integrate to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Summary of Prediction for 4-haloacetophenone:**\n        1.  A doublet, ~7.8 ppm, integrating to 2H.\n        2.  A doublet, ~7.6 ppm, integrating to 2H.\n        3.  A singlet, ~2.3 ppm, integrating to 3H.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the prediction with the given options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s):** The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s):** This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm), each for 2H, which is characteristic of a para-substituted ring. It also shows a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is perfect for a methyl ketone. This option is an excellent match for our predicted spectrum of 4-haloacetophenone.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s):** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This is inconsistent with the most likely structure.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s):** The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The splitting pattern and integrations do not match a di-substituted benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone, which fits all the criteria given in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo identify the correct 1H NMR data, we must first deduce the most likely structure of the compound based on the provided information.\n\n### Structural Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄).\n2.  **Total Carbons**: The molecule contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n3.  **Functional Groups**: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\nBased on these points, we can determine the nature of the two substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nThe most common and stable substituent fitting the \"2 carbons and a carbonyl\" description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃). This gives us a haloacetophenone structure (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n\nAnother possibility could be a formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO), leading to a halophenylacetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n### 1H NMR Data Interpretation\n\nNow, let's analyze the given NMR options in the context of these possible structures. The options B and C both show a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This \"two-doublet\" pattern is highly characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring, which creates a symmetrical molecule.\n\n*   **Option A and D** can be eliminated. Option D lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Option A shows only one proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons).\n\nWe are left with options B and C, which correspond to the two plausible *para*-substituted structures:\n\n*   **Structure for Option C**: *p*-haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group directly attached to the ring, which strongly deshields the aromatic protons, shifting them downfield. The provided shifts of 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm are consistent with this. For example, the aromatic protons of *p*-chloroacetophenone are found at approximately 7.89 ppm and 7.43 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl protons**: The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are adjacent to a carbonyl, but not to any other protons, so they appear as a singlet. A chemical shift of ~2.3-2.6 ppm is typical for an acetyl group's methyl protons. The value of 2.3 ppm in option C is a very reasonable value.\n    *   The data in option C: **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)** is fully consistent with the structure of a *p*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Structure for Option B**: *p*-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n    *   **Aldehyde proton**: The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   **Methylene protons**: The signal at 3.7 ppm is appropriate for methylene protons (-CH₂) situated between an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: In this structure, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is separated from the ring by a -CH₂- group. This separation reduces its deshielding effect on the aromatic protons compared to acetophenone. Therefore, the aromatic proton signals would be expected at a higher field (lower ppm value), typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The shifts of 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm given in option B are too far downfield for this structure. For instance, the aromatic protons of 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (a similar structure) appear around 7.3 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical shifts for the aromatic protons in option C (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are much more consistent with the strong deshielding effect of a carbonyl group directly attached to the aromatic ring, as in *p*-haloacetophenone. The data in option B, while correctly identifying an aldehyde, presents aromatic shifts that are inconsistent with the proposed structure. Therefore, the compound is a *p*-haloacetophenone, and the correct NMR data is provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n*   **Substitution:** It is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\nBased on this information, one substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). The other substituent must contain the two carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure satisfies all the given conditions: it's a di-substituted benzene ring, has 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the acetyl group), contains a carbonyl group, and has an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Options\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given 1H NMR data options based on the predicted structure of a haloacetophenone. The substitution can be ortho, meta, or para. A common pattern in these problems involves the highly symmetric para (1,4) substitution.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. A structure like p-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO) would have 8 carbons. However, the aldehyde proton should be a triplet (split by the adjacent CH2 group), and the CH2 protons should be a doublet (split by the CHO proton). The data shows two singlets, which contradicts the expected splitting pattern.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are shifted further downfield (deshielded) compared to the two protons closer to the halogen.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3 protons, is in the typical chemical shift range for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of a 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone). For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet for the methyl group at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons at ~7.45 ppm and ~7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows a methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm and aromatic signals around 7.62 ppm and 7.83 ppm. The values in option C are consistent with this structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which would have 4 aromatic protons). The other signals are not in the expected regions for the proposed structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that correctly corresponds to a di-substituted, 8-carbon aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The structure is a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n*   **Di-substituted:** There are two substituents on the benzene ring, so the core is C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nLet's deduce the substituents. One substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, which include two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most plausible structure for this second substituent is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n\nCombining these parts, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 carbons in the ring and 2 in the acetyl group, totaling the required 8 carbons.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nFor a haloacetophenone, we expect signals from two types of protons:\n\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically in the range of 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-):** There are four protons on the di-substituted ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4):** This arrangement is symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are split into two chemically distinct sets. This typically results in two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution (1,2):** This would result in a more complex pattern, likely with four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Meta-substitution (1,3):** This would also lead to a complex pattern, generally showing four distinct signals.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nLet's compare our expected spectrum with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This signal perfectly matches the expected singlet for the 3 protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region (downfield of 7 ppm) is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. For instance, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows two doublets for the aromatic protons at approximately 7.91 ppm and 7.45 ppm, and a singlet for the methyl protons at 2.61 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows aromatic signals around 7.83 ppm and 7.61 ppm, with the methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm. The data in option A is highly consistent with a para-haloacetophenone structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (usually > 6.5 ppm). The integration and splitting patterns do not match our expected structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option B, the signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are incorrect for aromatic protons. The singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl ketone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts the structure we deduced (an acetophenone).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option A, featuring a singlet for three protons around 2.3 ppm and two doublets for two protons each in the aromatic region, is the only choice that accurately represents this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The general formula for the ring portion is C6H4.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n    *   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One substituent is a halogen atom (like -Cl, -Br, -I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. A halogen atom has 0 carbons.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Substituents and the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on the C6H4 ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This accounts for 0 of the 2 carbons needed for the substituents.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The simplest and most common 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Possible Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    The molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring, so it can exist as ortho, meta, or para isomers. Let's consider the expected 1H NMR patterns for the aromatic protons (the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring):\n    *   **Ortho-isomer:** The 4 aromatic protons would be non-equivalent and would show a complex multiplet pattern.\n    *   **Meta-isomer:** The 4 aromatic protons would also show a complex pattern, although sometimes one proton might appear as a broad singlet.\n    *   **Para-isomer:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. The 4 aromatic protons are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H at 6.9 ppm), which contradicts a di-substituted ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic signature of a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n        *   **Alkyl Region:** It shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H. This is the expected signal for the methyl (-CH3) protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3), which are a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. The chemical shift is also appropriate.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the structure of **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This molecule contains an aldehyde, not a ketone as deduced. If the molecule were 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (C8H7XO), it would fit some of the data, but critically, the halogen would be on a methyl group (Ar-CH2-X), not directly on the ring. The problem explicitly states an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** was detected by FTIR. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is 4-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two doublets in the aromatic region for the para-substituted ring and a singlet for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. Option C is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms (C₆H₄).\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a C=O double bond. This must be part of one of the substituents.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** The FTIR data also indicates a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n### **2. Determine the Possible Structure**\n\nBased on the information above, we can deduce the two substituents on the benzene ring:\n1.  A **halogen atom** (–X).\n2.  A substituent containing **2 carbons and a carbonyl group**. The most common and stable arrangement for this is an **acetyl group** (–COCH₃).\n\nCombining these parts, the most likely molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The total formula would be C₈H₇XO, which is consistent with the requirements.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. Let's consider the ¹H NMR spectrum for the most symmetrical and common arrangement, the **para (1,4) substitution**.\n\n*   **Structure:** 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone).\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** Due to the para substitution, the four protons on the benzene ring are divided into two chemically equivalent sets. This typically results in two distinct signals, each appearing as a doublet and integrating to 2 protons. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield).\n*   **Substituent Protons:** The acetyl group (–COCH₃) has three equivalent protons on the methyl group. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a singlet, integrating to 3 protons.\n\nTherefore, the predicted ¹H NMR spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone is:\n*   A doublet for 2H in the aromatic region (~7.6-8.0 ppm).\n*   Another doublet for 2H in the aromatic region (~7.4-7.7 ppm).\n*   A singlet for 3H in the aliphatic region (~2.3-2.6 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This option corresponds to (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde. While this structure fits the carbon count and functional groups, the aldehyde (CHO) and adjacent methylene (CH₂) protons would typically split each other into a triplet and a doublet, respectively. The observation of two singlets is atypical.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 7-8 ppm), so it cannot represent an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the prediction for 4-haloacetophenone. It shows the characteristic para-substituted aromatic pattern of two doublets for two protons each and a methyl singlet for three protons. The chemical shifts are well within the expected ranges.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows 1 aromatic proton, which is inconsistent.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula, functional groups, and substitution pattern derived from the problem description point to 4-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data in option C is the only one that correctly and unambiguously represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   **Base Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means we start with a benzene ring (C6).\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** indicates one substituent contains this functional group.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond** means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain the C=O group and both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms. The only common and stable group that fits this is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   The structure is a haloacetophenone.\n\n**2. Determine the Substitution Pattern:**\n\nThe problem is to identify the correct 1H NMR data. Let's analyze the patterns given in the options.\n\n*   Options A and C show a pattern of `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm). This is a classic, simplified pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. Due to symmetry, the two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   Ortho or meta substitution would lead to more complex splitting patterns with potentially four distinct signals.\n\nBased on the options, the compound is **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** We expect two signals in the aromatic region (~7.0-8.0 ppm). Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, so the protons will be deshielded (shifted downfield). The pattern will be two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Acetyl Group Protons:** The `-COCH3` group has a methyl group. These 3 protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3 protons**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s) ... 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) ...**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons in the exact region expected for a methyl ketone.\n    *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for para-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) ...**\n    *   Similar to B, the chemical shifts are not in the typical aromatic proton range. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The data in option C is the only one consistent with the structure deduced from the provided information.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided information to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n    \n    1.  **Deduce Structure:**\n        - Aromatic ring: 6 carbons.\n        - Total carbons: 8.

This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H4) that has two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is F, Cl, Br, or I) is present.\n\n**Step 2: Propose a plausible chemical structure.**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, one substituent is a halogen (-X) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen (from the carbonyl group).\n*   The most common and stable functional group that fits the \"2 carbons and a C=O\" description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n*   The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a halogen on the ring, a carbonyl group, and is di-substituted. This fits all the given information.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons on the ring. The splitting pattern of these protons depends on the positions of the substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n*   The options provided (especially C and D) show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H). This highly symmetric pattern is characteristic of **para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution)**. In a para-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and each proton has only one adjacent proton to couple with, resulting in two doublets.\n*   Let's assume the compound is **para-haloacetophenone**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (on the ring):**\n    *   There will be 4 aromatic protons in total.\n    *   They will appear as two signals because of the ring's symmetry.\n    *   Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, so the protons will be deshielded and appear downfield (typically between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm).\n    *   We expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H. For example: δ ≈ 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and δ ≈ 7.6 ppm (2H, d).\n*   **Aliphatic Protons (on the substituents):**\n    *   The only aliphatic protons are on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent (-COCH3).\n    *   This methyl group has 3 protons, so its signal will integrate to 3H.\n    *   It is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will not be split, appearing as a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm. We expect a signal like: δ ≈ 2.3 ppm (3H, s).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This option shows only 1 proton in the aromatic region. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches the expected signal for an acetyl group's methyl protons.\n    *   This option is fully consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). If the compound were an aldehyde (e.g., para-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde, X-C6H4-CH2CHO), the aldehyde proton would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 protons, appearing as a triplet, not a singlet. Similarly, the CH2 protons would appear as a doublet, not a singlet. The multiplicities in this option are inconsistent with a plausible structure. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only NMR data that matches the deductions from the molecular formula and FTIR data is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O double bond.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** This tells us that one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Substituents**\n\n*   We have two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This accounts for 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both remaining carbon atoms (2 carbons) and the carbonyl group.\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   Therefore, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**3. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   Combining the benzene ring with the two substituents, the compound must be a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   Let's check if this structure fits all the criteria:\n    *   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl group) = 8. Yes.\n    *   Carbonyl group: Yes, in the acetyl group.\n    *   Aromatic-halogen bond: Yes, the halogen is directly on the ring.\n*   The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO, which means the molecule has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the ring, 3 in the methyl group).\n\n**4. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nNow we must find the 1H NMR spectrum that matches a haloacetophenone structure. Let's assume the most symmetric isomer, para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution), as it gives a simple, recognizable NMR pattern.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at **9.9 ppm** is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO). Our structure is a ketone, not an aldehyde. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (approximately 6.5-8.5 ppm). This spectrum cannot belong to an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, doublet)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, doublet)** are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The two sets of equivalent protons split each other into doublets. The chemical shifts are downfield, which is consistent with the presence of two electron-withdrawing groups (the halogen and the acetyl group).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, singlet)** is characteristic of a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (-COCH₃)**. It is a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbon atom to cause splitting.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a p-haloacetophenone. The total number of protons is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which is correct.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The pattern of signals is not consistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option C, showing a para-substituted aromatic pattern and a methyl ketone singlet, is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The compound is based on a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbons.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Deduce Possible Structures:**\n    *   Based on the information, a halogen (X) is one substituent.\n    *   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. Two common structures fit this description:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃). This would form a **haloacetophenone**.\n        *   A formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO). This would form a **halophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Both of these potential structures have a total of 8 carbon atoms (6 from the ring + 2 from the side chain), a carbonyl group, and a halogen attached to the ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Options A and B both show two doublets around 7.6-7.8 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons (2H). This pattern is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. Options C and D do not fit this description. Option C lacks any aromatic signals (6.5-8.5 ppm) and is incorrect. Option D's pattern is inconsistent with a di-substituted ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region & Functional Groups:**\n        *   **Option A:** Shows a singlet at 9.9 ppm (1H) and a singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H). The signal at 9.9 ppm is definitive for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). The signal at 3.7 ppm is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. This data perfectly matches the structure of a **(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The integration (1+2+2+2 = 7 protons) is correct for this structure. For example, the reported spectrum for 2-(4-bromophenyl)acetaldehyde shows peaks at 9.70 ppm (t, 1H), 7.50 ppm (d, 2H), 7.08 ppm (d, 2H), and 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). This closely matches the data in option A.\n        *   **Option B:** Shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H). This signal is characteristic of a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl** (-COCH₃). This data corresponds to a **4-haloacetophenone**. The integration (2+2+3 = 7 protons) is also correct for this structure. For example, the reported spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows peaks around 7.6-7.9 ppm and a methyl singlet around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Option C & D:** These are incorrect as they do not show the characteristic peaks for an aromatic compound as described.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both options A and B represent plausible structures that fit the initial description. However, they describe two different compounds: (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde and 4-haloacetophenone, respectively. Since the question provides a specific set of data options, we must choose the one that is listed. Both are valid spectra for compounds fitting the criteria, but only one can be the correct answer choice. Reviewing the choices, Option A provides a complete and consistent set of data for (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\nThe data presented in option A is:\n*   **9.9 ppm (1H, s):** Aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n*   **7.8 ppm (2H, d) & 7.6 ppm (2H, d):** Para-substituted aromatic ring protons.\n*   **3.7 ppm (2H, s):** Methylene protons (-CH₂-) adjacent to the ring and the carbonyl.\n\nThis set of data is a perfect match for a (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde, which fulfills all the conditions given in the prompt.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which is a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means a halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**, with the general formula **X-C₆H₄-COCH₃**. This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring, fitting all the given criteria.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Substitution Pattern and Expected ¹H NMR\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. The ¹H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** These protons appear in the downfield region, typically between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm.\n    *   For **ortho** or **meta** substitution, there would be four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex pattern of signals.\n    *   For **para** (1,4) substitution, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in a simpler and very characteristic pattern: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a single sharp peak (a singlet). This signal is typically found around 2.3–2.6 ppm.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare the expected spectrum with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is incorrect for a benzene derivative.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 6.9 ppm is low for an acetophenone derivative. More importantly, the singlet at 1.3 ppm integrates to 2H, which is inconsistent with a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are the classic A₂B₂ pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons, shifting them further downfield (7.8 ppm) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen (7.6 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is exactly what is expected for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-Bromoacetophenone shows a singlet at 2.60 ppm and two signals for the aromatic protons at 7.61-7.63 ppm and 7.83-7.84 ppm. Similarly, 4-Chloroacetophenone shows a methyl singlet at 2.61 ppm and doublets at 7.45 ppm and 7.91 ppm. The values in option C are consistent with these reported spectra.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. While an aldehyde contains a carbonyl group, the rest of the structure required to fit this NMR data would contradict the condition of having an \"aromatic-halogen bond\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data presented in option C is the only one that correctly represents all the structural features of the described compound, specifically pointing to a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule based on the information provided and then determine which of the given ¹H NMR spectra corresponds to that structure.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆).\n*   **Total Carbons:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the substituents must contain the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Di-substituted:** There are two groups attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the two substituents are a halogen atom (-X) and a group containing a carbonyl and a methyl group. The most plausible structure for this second substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Data\n\nNow we need to analyze the provided ¹H NMR options to see which one matches the structure of a haloacetophenone. A key feature of the ¹H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted benzene ring is the pattern of the aromatic protons (in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). The substitution can be *ortho*, *meta*, or *para*.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not the methyl ketone we deduced. This spectrum would better fit a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The integration of the aromatic region is only 1H, which is incorrect for a di-substituted benzene ring (it should have 4 aromatic protons).\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (> 6.5 ppm), so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **para (1,4) substituted** benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are shifted further downfield (deshielded) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The signal at **2.3 ppm** is a singlet integrating to 3 protons. This is the exact expected chemical shift and multiplicity for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ¹H NMR data in option D perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **p-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet for the methyl group around 2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons at approximately 7.45 ppm and 7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows the methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm and aromatic signals at 7.62 and 7.83 ppm. The values in option D are well within the expected range for this class of compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n    *   **Molecular Framework:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** \"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\". Since the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n        *   \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X). This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This fits the criteria (2 carbons, one C=O).\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also fits the criteria (2 carbons, one C=O).\n        *   **Carboxymethyl group (-CH2COOH):** This fits, but carboxylic acids have a very characteristic broad OH peak in the FTIR and a very downfield proton (>10 ppm) in the 1H NMR, which is not suggested by all options.\n    *   Based on these possibilities, the most likely molecular structures are a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) or a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) should show signals for 4 aromatic protons, typically in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum shows no signals in the aromatic region (> 6.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H). A di-substituted benzene ring must have four. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**:\n        *   The signal at **9.9 ppm (1H, s)** is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest the structure is a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n        *   The signal at **3.7 ppm (2H, s)** would correspond to the -CH2- group.\n        *   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** are from the 4 aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets suggests *para* substitution.\n        *   **Critique:** In a phenylacetaldehyde structure, the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group is insulated from the ring by a -CH2- group. Its effect on the aromatic proton chemical shifts is weakened. The aromatic protons for a compound like *p*-chlorophenylacetaldehyde appear around 7.2-7.3 ppm. The shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are too far downfield for this structure.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**:\n        *   The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH3). This suggests the structure is a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n        *   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** are from the 4 aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets suggests *para* substitution.\n        *   **Critique:** In a *p*-haloacetophenone structure, the strongly electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring, causing the ortho protons to shift significantly downfield. The halogen also influences the shifts. This combination perfectly explains the downfield aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. For instance, the actual spectrum of *p*-bromoacetophenone is ~7.82 (d), ~7.60 (d), ~2.59 (s). Option D is an excellent match for this structure.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecule that fits all the given information (di-substituted aromatic, 8 carbons, C=O, Ar-X) and matches the NMR data is a *para*-haloacetophenone. Option D provides the spectrum that corresponds to this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and all 2 remaining carbon atoms. The most logical structure for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**3. Consider the Positional Isomers**\n\nSince the benzene ring is di-substituted, there are three possible isomers:\n*   **ortho-haloacetophenone** (1,2-substitution)\n*   **meta-haloacetophenone** (1,3-substitution)\n*   **para-haloacetophenone** (1,4-substitution)\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Isomers**\n\nWe need to predict the signals (chemical shift, integration, splitting) for the protons in the molecule. The molecule has protons on the aromatic ring (4H) and on the acetyl group's methyl (3H), for a total of 7 protons.\n\n*   **Acetyl Group (-COCH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Because the methyl group is attached to a carbonyl, it will be deshielded and appear around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** The pattern for the 4 aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern.\n    *   **ortho-isomer:** All 4 aromatic protons are in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex spectrum with four distinct signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not the simple patterns shown in the options.\n    *   **meta-isomer:** This would also lead to a complex pattern, likely with four distinct signals for the 4 non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **para-isomer:** This isomer has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent (let's call them Hₐ).\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent (let's call them Hₑ).\n        *   Each Hₐ proton is coupled only to an adjacent Hₑ proton, so the Hₐ signal will be a **doublet (d)** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Similarly, each Hₑ proton is coupled only to an adjacent Hₐ proton, so the Hₑ signal will be a **doublet (d)** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing and will deshield its ortho protons (Hₐ) significantly, pushing them downfield (higher ppm value) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen (Hₑ). We expect the aromatic signals to be in the **7.0-8.0 ppm** range.\n\n**5. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\nOur predicted spectrum for the most likely isomer, **para-haloacetophenone**, is:\n*   A doublet for 2H (aromatic)\n*   Another doublet for 2H (aromatic)\n*   A singlet for 3H (acetyl methyl) at ~2.3 ppm\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone. We have two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group. The downfield doublet at 7.8 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the deshielding carbonyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The integration of 2H for the singlet at 1.3 ppm is also incorrect for a methyl group.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. A 3H singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone (-COCH₃). The problem's constraints (8 carbons, di-substituted ring) strongly point to a ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the 1H NMR data in option A is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   **Atom Count:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, which means the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the possible chemical structure(s):**\n    *   We have a benzene ring as the core structure.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). A halogen atom contributes 0 carbon atoms to the total count.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The most common and stable chemical group that fits the formula C2HnO and contains a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Let's verify this proposed structure: **Haloacetophenone**.\n        *   Total Carbons: 6 (from the benzene ring) + 2 (from the acetyl group) = 8. This matches the requirement.\n        *   Substituents: A halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). This is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   Functional Groups: The structure contains an aromatic-halogen bond and a carbonyl group (from the ketone). This matches the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the substitution pattern and predict the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents can be in the *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4) positions.\n    *   Let's examine the aromatic proton signals in the answer choices. Options A and D both show a `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern (two doublets, each integrating to two protons) in the aromatic region (chemical shift > 7 ppm).\n    *   This specific pattern is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude the compound is a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** We expect two signals for the 4 aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be shifted downfield (higher ppm value). The two protons ortho to the halogen will be slightly more upfield (lower ppm value). They split each other, so we expect two doublets. A typical range would be approximately 7.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The structure has an acetyl group, -COCH3. The three protons of this methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s) integrating to 3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically in the range of **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Compare the prediction with the given options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This data does not match our structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts are incorrect. The aromatic signals are missing (should be > 7 ppm).\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option also lacks any signals in the aromatic region. It cannot be correct.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This chemical shift and multiplicity are a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH**3**).\n        *   This dataset is a perfect match for our deduced structure, **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and basic structure.**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   It is di-substituted, meaning two hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced by other groups. This gives a C6H4 core.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen atom directly attached to the benzene ring).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the two substituents.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the carbonyl group and both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms. The most plausible functional group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The general structure is X-C6H4-C(=O)CH3.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) from the 1H NMR data.**\n    *   The aromatic region of a 1H NMR spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) is very informative about the substitution pattern on a benzene ring.\n    *   Let's look at the aromatic signals in the given options:\n        *   A) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   B) 6.9 (1H, s) (signals at 4.6-4.8 are not aromatic)\n        *   C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   D) No aromatic signals.\n    *   A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature for a **para (1,4) di-substituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer makes the two protons ortho to the first substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the second substituent equivalent. This results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by its single, non-equivalent neighbor.\n    *   Therefore, the compound must be a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the complete 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone and compare it with the options.**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n              O\n              ||\n              C-CH3\n              |\n          /¯¯¯\\_/¯¯¯\\\n         |     |     |\n         \\___/¯\\___/\n              |\n              X (Halogen)\n        ```\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** As determined in Step 3, there will be two doublets, representing a total of 4 protons. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the two protons ortho to it will be more deshielded (further downfield, higher ppm). The halogen is also electron-withdrawing, so the two protons ortho to it will also be downfield. We expect two signals in the ~7.5-8.0 ppm range.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The compound has a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the carbonyl carbon. These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl ketone (R-C(=O)CH3) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the given options against the prediction.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the 4 aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons in the expected chemical shift range for a methyl ketone.\n        *   This option is a perfect match for the structure of para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Incorrect number of aromatic protons and incorrect splitting. The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too far upfield for a typical aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n        *   The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` does not match the expected methyl singlet. This option describes a different compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is the only choice that is fully consistent with all the information provided for a di-substituted C8 aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Parent Structure**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄). This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring.\n*   **Total Carbons**: The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups**: The FTIR data reveals two key functional groups:\n    1.  A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    2.  An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n*   **Substituents**: Based on the functional groups, one substituent on the benzene ring is a halogen atom (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon. Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl-containing Substituent**: The most common and stable substituent containing two carbons and a carbonyl group is the **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n*   **Final Structure**: Combining these pieces of information, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions. The provided NMR data options will help determine the specific arrangement. Let's analyze the expected signals for a haloacetophenone (C₆H₄(X)(COCH₃)):\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**: There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern will depend on the substitution pattern. They typically appear in the range of 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃)**: There are 3 protons in the acetyl group's methyl group. Since this methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and not to any carbon with protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Its chemical shift is typically around **2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Given NMR Options\n\n**A) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n*   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. This would imply the structure is a halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). While this structure also has 8 carbons, the multiplicity is incorrect. The -CH₂- and -CHO protons would couple, leading to a doublet and a triplet, not two singlets.\n\n**B) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n*   The chemical shifts around 4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons, which are typically found above 6.5 ppm. This option is inconsistent with an aromatic structure.\n\n**C) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n*   Similar to option B, the signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The methyl singlet at 1.3 ppm is too shielded (upfield) for an acetyl group, which is typically found around 2.5 ppm.\n\n**D) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are a classic pattern for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The two pairs of chemically non-equivalent protons split each other into doublets. The chemical shifts are in the expected range for an aromatic ring with two electron-withdrawing groups.\n*   **Aliphatic Region**: The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H perfectly matches the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n*   **Overall Consistency**: This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. It accounts for the correct number of protons (4 aromatic + 3 methyl = 7 total), correct multiplicities (two doublets and a singlet), and plausible chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data in option D precisely describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone, which fits all the criteria given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound, a step-by-step structural elucidation is necessary based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Deducing the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms. The most common and stable structure fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This group has exactly two carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Isomers and Predicting NMR Spectra**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as three possible isomers: ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-). The 1H NMR splitting pattern is highly dependent on this substitution.\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-Isomers:** These isomers are unsymmetrical. They would show complex splitting patterns in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Para-Isomer:** This isomer (e.g., 4'-haloacetophenone) is symmetrical about the axis passing through both substituents. This symmetry results in a much simpler 1H NMR spectrum:\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the halogen are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   This leads to two distinct signals in the aromatic region, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. Each doublet would integrate to 2H.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is isolated and has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3H.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the NMR Data Options**\n\nLet's compare the predicted spectrum for the para-isomer with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, and a singlet for 3 protons. This pattern perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone**. The reported chemical shifts are also consistent; for example, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4'-Bromoacetophenone is reported as δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61(d, 2H), 2.57 (s, 3H). Similarly, 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.43 (d, 2H), 2.59 (s, 3H).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This contradicts the acetyl group structure. Also, a 3H singlet for the methyl group is absent.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This data does not correspond to a di-substituted benzene ring. The signals and splitting patterns are inconsistent with an aromatic structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), indicating it is not an aromatic compound.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option that correctly represents the 1H NMR data for the described compound (a para-haloacetophenone) is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo identify the correct 1H NMR data, we must first deduce the structure of the compound from the given information.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Core Structure:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6). It is di-substituted and contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This leaves two carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n2.  **Functional Groups from FTIR:** The FTIR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\n3.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nNow, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options. The molecule has two sets of protons: those on the aromatic ring and those on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3H. Their chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Their chemical shift is in the aromatic region, typically 6.5-8.0 ppm. The splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm). The peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too far upfield. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Similar to A, this option does not show a pattern consistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. The integration of 2H for a singlet at 1.3 ppm is also unusual for the proposed structure. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two signals in the aromatic region, `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons more significantly than the halogen, which accounts for the two distinct doublets. For example, the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows doublets at approximately 7.9 ppm and 7.4 ppm. Likewise, 4-bromoacetophenone shows doublets around 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons:** The signal `2.3 (3H, s)` is a singlet integrating to three protons at a chemical shift consistent with a methyl group next to a carbonyl.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest a different structure, such as a *para*-halophenylacetaldehyde (-CH2CHO substituent). However, in such a structure, the methylene protons (-CH2-) and the aldehyde proton (-CHO) are adjacent and would split each other, resulting in a doublet and a triplet, respectively. Since the data shows two singlets, this option is inconsistent with the expected splitting patterns.\n\nBased on this analysis, the data in option C is the only one that correctly represents the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct structure and its corresponding 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. This leaves 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring itself.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR peak for a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **FTIR peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X):** The other substituent is a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br) directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: two carbons and one oxygen in a carbonyl group. The only possible arrangement for a C₂ substituent with a carbonyl group attached to a ring is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n3.  **Consider the isomerism (ortho, meta, para):**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will be simplest for the most symmetrical isomer, which is the *para* (1,4) substituted compound. A *para*-disubstituted ring with two different substituents will show two distinct signals for the aromatic protons. Due to symmetry, the two protons next to substituent A are equivalent, and the two protons next to substituent B are equivalent. These two groups of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex splitting patterns, not two simple doublets.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (around 7.0-8.0 ppm):** We expect to see two signals, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, and both appearing as doublets. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be the most downfield (highest ppm value).\n        *   A doublet for 2H around 7.8 ppm.\n        *   A doublet for the other 2H slightly more upfield, around 7.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** We have a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a carbonyl. This methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with, so it will appear as a singlet. It will integrate to 3 hydrogens. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   A singlet for 3H around 2.3 ppm.\n\n5.  **Compare the prediction with the given options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This perfectly matches our prediction: two doublets in the aromatic region for a *para*-substituted ring and a singlet for a methyl ketone group.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde, not a ketone. An aldehyde would only have 7 total carbons (p-halobenzaldehyde), which contradicts the problem statement.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals are not in the correct region for an aromatic compound of this type, and the integration (1H + 2H + 2H on the ring) is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nThe correct 1H NMR data corresponds to a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound, we must first deduce its structure based on the given information.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (6 carbons).\n*   **Di-substituted:** There are two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group:** A C=O group is present.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. A chemically stable and common group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The base structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Options:\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given ¹H NMR data to see which one matches the predicted structure of a haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Expected features of a haloacetophenone spectrum:**\n    *   A signal for the methyl (CH₃) protons of the acetyl group. This should be a singlet (s) integrating to 3 hydrogens (3H), typically in the range of 2.0-2.7 ppm.\n    *   Signals for the aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted ring, there will be 4 aromatic protons. Their splitting pattern will depend on whether the substitution is ortho, meta, or para. A para (1,4) substitution often leads to a symmetrical pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. The chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm). Electron-withdrawing groups like a carbonyl and a halogen will shift these protons downfield.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, which is highly characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also features a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n        *   Spectral data for known para-haloacetophenones like 4-chloroacetophenone (δ ~7.9 (d, 2H), ~7.4 (d, 2H), 2.6 (s, 3H)) and 4-bromoacetophenone (δ ~7.8 (d, 2H), ~7.6 (d, 2H), 2.6 (s, 3H)) are very similar to this option. This is a strong match.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data is inconsistent. It lacks the typical aromatic signals in the 7-8 ppm range and the characteristic 3H singlet for a methyl ketone. The signals at ~4.7 ppm and a 2H singlet are not expected.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic proton region (6.5-8.0 ppm), which contradicts the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (p-halophenylacetaldehyde, X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), it would also have 8 carbons and fit the general description. However, this option does not contain the 3H singlet expected from the more common acetyl group (-COCH₃) structure which is a ketone. While p-halophenylacetaldehyde is a possibility, the spectrum for p-bromo-phenylacetaldehyde is reported as δ 9.70 (t, 1H), 7.50 (d, 2H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). The splitting of the aldehyde and methylene protons in this literature data (triplet and doublet, respectively) does not match the singlets described in option D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOption A provides the most accurate and consistent ¹H NMR data for a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen, which is best identified as a para-haloacetophenone. The two doublets in the aromatic region and the 3-proton singlet for the methyl ketone are the key identifying features.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Features:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. This means the two substituents together must contain 2 additional carbons (8 total - 6 ring = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR...carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's call it 'X'.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is `-X` (a halogen). This substituent has 0 carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons AND the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible structures for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group:\n        *   **Acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)**: This has two carbons and a carbonyl. This is a very common and stable substituent.\n        *   **2-Oxoethyl group (`-CH₂CHO`)**: This also has two carbons and a carbonyl (an aldehyde). This is another possibility.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Molecular Structures and Predict their ¹H NMR Spectra:**\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Acetyl group + Halogen on a benzene ring.**\n        *   Structure: Haloacetophenone. The most symmetrical arrangement is `para` (1,4-substitution), which would be **4-halo-acetophenone**.\n        *   Let's predict the ¹H NMR for 4-halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃):\n            *   **Aromatic Protons**: The `para` substitution creates symmetry. There will be two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. This gives a characteristic pattern of two doublets (`2H, d` and `2H, d`). The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be downfield (higher ppm, ~7.8-8.0 ppm). The protons closer to the halogen will be slightly more upfield (~7.5-7.7 ppm).\n            *   **Acetyl Protons**: The methyl group (`-CH₃`) is next to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so it will be a singlet (`s`). It will have an integration of `3H`. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.8 ppm (2H, d), ~7.6 ppm (2H, d), ~2.3 ppm (3H, s).\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: 2-Oxoethyl group + Halogen on a benzene ring.**\n        *   Structure: Halo-phenylacetaldehyde. Again, let's assume a `para` substitution for symmetry: **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Let's predict the ¹H NMR for 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO):\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (`-CHO`)**: This gives a very characteristic signal far downfield (~9.5-10.0 ppm). It's a singlet (`s`) or a triplet (`t`) and integrates to `1H`.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (`-CH₂-`)**: These are adjacent to the aldehyde proton, so they should be split into a doublet (`d`). They integrate to `2H`. The chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n            *   **Aromatic Protons**: Similar to the first case, we'd expect two doublets (`2H, d` and `2H, d`) in the aromatic region (~7.0-7.8 ppm).\n        *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~9.9 ppm (1H, s/t), ~7.8 ppm (2H, d), ~7.6 ppm (2H, d), ~3.7 ppm (2H, d).\n\n4.  **Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum matches our prediction for 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde. It has the aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm, the methylene protons at 3.7 ppm, and the para-substituted aromatic pattern. However, the multiplicity for the `-CH₂CHO` group is given as two singlets (`s`), which is unusual. They should typically couple to form a doublet and a triplet. While not impossible (if the coupling constant is near zero), it is anomalous.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum is a **perfect textbook match** for our prediction for 4-halo-acetophenone. All chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns (multiplicity) are exactly as expected.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. It lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect. The integration for the aromatic proton (1H) does not fit a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4H).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both A and B correspond to structures that fit the initial description. However, the spectrum in option B is a classic, unambiguous match for 4-halo-acetophenone. The spectrum in option A represents 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde but with questionable multiplicity.

This is a benzene ring with two groups attached.\n*   **Atom Count:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n*   **Summary of deduced facts:** The molecule is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom (-X) and one other group that contains 2 carbon atoms and a carbonyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Propose possible structures**\n\nLet's figure out the substituent that contains 2 carbons and a C=O group.\n*   **Possibility 1: An acetyl group (-COCH₃).** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. If this and a halogen are attached to a benzene ring, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This fits perfectly. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**.\n*   **Possibility 2: A formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO).** This group also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. If this and a halogen are attached to a benzene ring, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (formylmethyl) = 8. This also fits. The resulting compound would be a **halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the general patterns in the NMR options**\n\nLooking at the NMR options, options A and C show a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: `~7.8 (2H, d)` and `~7.6 (2H, d)`.\n*   **What this pattern means:** Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   So, we can confidently assume our compound is a **para-isomer**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the para-isomers of our candidate structures**\n\n*   **Candidate 1: para-Haloacetophenone**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The ring is attached to a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing and is directly attached to the ring. This will strongly *deshield* the aromatic protons, moving their signals far downfield (to a high ppm value). We would expect the two doublets to be in the ~7.5 - 8.0 ppm range.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** There is a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the carbonyl. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Its typical chemical shift is around **2.1 - 2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets between 7.5-8.0 ppm (total 4H), and one singlet around 2.3 ppm (3H).\n\n*   **Candidate 2: para-Halo-phenylacetaldehyde**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is highly deshielded and gives a unique signal very far downfield, typically **9-10 ppm**. It will be a singlet (s) or a triplet (t).\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The methylene protons (-CH₂-) are in a benzylic position (next to the ring). Their signal would be around **3.5 - 4.0 ppm**. It would be a singlet (s) or a doublet (d).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The ring is attached to a halogen (-X) and a -CH₂CHO group. The group directly attached is the -CH₂-, which is not strongly electron-withdrawing. The electronic effect is insulated by the CH₂. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be much less deshielded than in Candidate 1. Their chemical shifts would be expected around **7.1 - 7.4 ppm**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predictions with the given options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This has the aldehyde proton (9.9 ppm) and the methylene proton (3.7 ppm) signals that match Candidate 2 (para-Halo-phenylacetaldehyde).\n    *   **However**, the aromatic proton signals (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield. They do not match a ring substituted with a -CH₂- group. This option has an internal inconsistency.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   These chemical shifts and splitting patterns are not consistent with a di-substituted aromatic compound. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The aromatic signals (`7.8`, `7.6` ppm) are strongly deshielded, which is perfectly consistent with a ring directly attached to an electron-withdrawing acetyl group.\n    *   The aliphatic signal `2.3 (3H, s)` is a perfect match for a methyl ketone (-COCH₃).\n    *   This spectrum is a textbook match for **para-Haloacetophenone (Candidate 1)**. All features are consistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   These are not aromatic chemical shifts. Incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in option C is the only one that is fully consistent with a plausible structure (para-haloacetophenone) that meets all the criteria given in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nAn in-depth analysis of the problem leads to the following conclusion:\n\n1.  **Structure Determination:**\n    *   **Aromatic Core:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it's based on a benzene ring with two substituents (C6H4).\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The total carbon count is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contribute a total of 2 carbons.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is indicated.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The substituents must be a halogen atom (-X, 0 carbons) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl. The most common and stable such group is the acetyl group (-COCH3). Therefore, the molecule is a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n\n2.  **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   For a haloacetophenone, there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group, totaling **7 protons**.\n    *   The most symmetrical isomer is the **para-substituted** (1,4) isomer. This symmetry would simplify the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum into two signals, each being a **doublet** (due to splitting from a single adjacent proton) and each integrating to **2H**. These signals appear in the aromatic region (~7-8 ppm).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl, which has no protons. Thus, its signal will be a **singlet** and integrate to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s):** Incorrect. This spectrum lacks the classic aromatic pattern and a 3H singlet for a methyl group.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s):** Incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3).\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s):** **Correct.** This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for a para-haloacetophenone. It has two 2H doublets in the aromatic region (7.6 and 7.8 ppm) and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, consistent with a methyl ketone. The total proton count is 2+2+3 = 7.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s):** Incorrect. This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) and is therefore inconsistent with the structure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that matches the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound, let's break down the given information and analyze the possible structure.\n\n### **1. Structural Analysis**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbons.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O) present:** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond present:** A halogen atom (like Cl, Br, F) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nCombining these facts, the most plausible structure is a halo-acetophenone. This consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This structure has the required C₆ ring, a C₂ substituent containing a carbonyl (acetyl group), for a total of 8 carbons.\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. A para-substituted ring is highly symmetrical and gives a characteristic, simple ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Predicting the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for a **para-halo-acetophenone** (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone):\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing 2 hydrogens. These signals appear as doublets due to splitting by their neighbors. They are located in the downfield region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm) because of the deshielding effect of the aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing acetyl group.\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not to any other protons. Therefore, it will appear as a singlet (a single peak with no splitting). This signal will integrate to 3 hydrogens and typically appears around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\nSo, the predicted spectrum is: two doublets in the aromatic region (each for 2H) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (for 3H).\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    This option does not fit. The integration (number of hydrogens) and signal locations do not match an aromatic ketone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    This spectrum is a perfect match for a para-halo-acetophenone. It shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is characteristic of para-substitution. The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group. The total hydrogen count (2+2+3=7) is correct for C₈H₇XO.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This would correspond to a halo-phenylacetaldehyde. However, the methylene (-CH₂) and aldehyde (-CHO) protons should show coupling (doublet and triplet, respectively), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This option lacks any signals in the aromatic proton region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), which immediately disqualifies it since the compound is defined as aromatic.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data presented in option B is fully consistent with the structure of a para-halo-acetophenone, which satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo identify the correct ¹H NMR data, we must first deduce the most likely structure of the compound based on the information provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Compound's Structure:\n1.  **Core Structure**: A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring implies a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄).\n2.  **Total Carbons**: The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR)**:\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n### Deducing the Substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most plausible and common structure for a C₂-carbonyl substituent is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n\nCombining these parts, the most probable structure is a **haloacetophenone**. Assuming a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which leads to a simple and symmetrical NMR spectrum, a likely candidate is 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone.\n\n### Predicting the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Haloacetophenone:\nA para-substituted haloacetophenone has two sets of protons:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons**: Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, there are two distinct types of aromatic protons. Each type is adjacent to the other, resulting in two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm). Since there are four protons on the ring in total, each doublet will integrate to 2H.\n2.  **Methyl Protons**: The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will appear as a singlet. This signal is typically found in the 2.0-3.0 ppm range.\n\nSo, the predicted spectrum is: two doublets (each 2H) and one singlet (3H).\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals are not in the typical aromatic region and the integration and splitting patterns do not match our predicted structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for a para-substituted haloacetophenone. It has two doublets in the aromatic region integrating to 2H each (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) and a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm (`2.3 (3H, s)`). This is confirmed by spectral data for compounds like 4-chloroacetophenone, which shows a singlet for the methyl group around 2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), which contradicts the compound being an aromatic ring.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Decoding the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents. This ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl group:** One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and a two-carbon chain containing a carbonyl group. The most plausible structure for the second substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This leads to a haloacetophenone molecule. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Potential 1H NMR Spectra\n\nThe two substituents, a halogen and an acetyl group, can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. Let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each, focusing on the `para`-isomer (1,4-dihaloacetophenone), as it often results in a simpler, more recognizable spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** `para`-haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** Due to the symmetry of a para-substituted ring, the four aromatic protons are divided into two equivalent sets. This typically results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet, and each integrating to 2H. These signals are found in the aromatic region, generally between 6.5-8.0 ppm.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will appear as a singlet (a single unsplit peak). The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This option does not match our predicted structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have four). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`:** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring. The signals are in the correct aromatic region.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`:** This is a singlet representing three protons at a chemical shift characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for `para`-haloacetophenone. For example, the reported spectrum of 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows doublets around 7.89 and 7.43 ppm, and a singlet for the methyl group at 2.59 ppm, which is very close to the values in this option.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm) and is therefore incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data in option C is the only one that correctly represents a di-substituted, 8-carbon aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and a halogen. The structure is specifically a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for the ring part is C6H4.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\":** The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\":** One of the substituents contains a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\":** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\nCombining these facts:\n*   One substituent is -X.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and simple group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\nNow, we must consider the substitution pattern: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Options Based on the Deduced Structure:**\n\nThe general structure is a haloacetophenone. Let's predict the expected 1H NMR signals:\n*   An **acetyl group (-COCH3)** will show up as a **singlet** (since there are no adjacent protons) integrating to **3H**, typically in the chemical shift range of **δ 2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n*   The **aromatic protons** (4H on the C6H4 ring) will appear in the **δ 7.0-8.0 ppm** region. The splitting pattern will depend on the substitution (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Para (1,4) substitution:** Due to the symmetry, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This results in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) or Meta (1,3) substitution:** These isomers lack the symmetry of the para isomer and would produce a more complex pattern with up to four distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 7-8 ppm). The signals at δ 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are incorrect for protons on a benzene ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** We see two doublets at δ 7.8 and 7.6, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** We see a singlet at δ 2.3, integrating to 3H. This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons (making them appear further downfield, ~δ 7.8) relative to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. While this is a carbonyl group, the problem also states there is an *aromatic-halogen bond*. A structure like p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde would fit the carbon count and NMR signals, but the halogen would be on a methyl group (aliphatic), not the aromatic ring. Thus, this option contradicts the given information.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring. The signals at δ 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic proton region, and the integration (2H singlet for what should be a 3H methyl) is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only structure that fits all the descriptive information (8 carbons, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl, aromatic-halogen bond) is a **para-haloacetophenone**. The NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: The other substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X) and a second substituent that contains 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   The most straightforward and common chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This group has exactly 2 carbons and one carbonyl.\n    *   Let's check the total carbon count with this structure: 6 carbons (ring) + 2 carbons (acetyl group) = 8 carbons. This matches the information given.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular structure is a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Consider the Possible Isomers and Predict their 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n    *   The molecule has a total of 7 protons: 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers:** In these isomers, all 4 aromatic protons would be in different chemical environments, leading to a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not simple doublets.\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This isomer (4-haloacetophenone) has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n        *   This results in a characteristic splitting pattern in the aromatic region: **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is electron-withdrawing, so it will deshield the protons ortho to it, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield).\n        *   The halogen is also electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will also be downfield. We expect the aromatic protons to be in the range of ~7.3-8.0 ppm.\n        *   The methyl protons (-CH3) are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which deshields them. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**, integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone:** Aromatic region with two doublets (2H each) and an aliphatic region with one singlet (3H).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure that would fit this data is 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO), which also has 8 carbons. However, the aromatic protons in this compound would be expected at a lower chemical shift (around 7.2-7.3 ppm) because the -CH2CHO group is less electron-withdrawing than a directly attached -COCH3 group. The high shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) make this option inconsistent.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data does not show the expected pattern for a disubstituted benzene ring (typically 4 protons in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This data lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The integration (2H + 2H = 4H) is correct for the aromatic protons.\n        *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm, which is perfectly characteristic of a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl** (-COCH3).\n        *   The total proton count is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which matches our derived structure.\n        *   This spectrum is a textbook match for a **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a 4-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option D perfectly matches the expected spectrum for this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process used to solve this problem.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the Information to Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the molecule's core is a benzene ring that has two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The entire molecule has 8 carbons. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the functional groups on the molecule is a carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This confirms that one of the substituents is a halogen atom (like F, Cl, Br, or I) that is bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the Molecular Structure from the Deduced Pieces**\n\n*   Substituent 1 is a halogen (-X). A halogen atom contains 0 carbons.\n*   Substituent 2 must therefore contain all of the remaining atoms: the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only stable and common structure for this is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Combining these pieces, the molecule must be a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for a Haloacetophenone**\n\nNow, we need to think about what the 1H NMR spectrum of this molecule would look like. We consider the different types of protons and their expected signals.\n\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃)**:\n    *   There are 3 protons in this group.\n    *   They are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, their signal will not be split by any neighboring protons.\n    *   This will result in a **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**.\n    *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-)**:\n    *   There are 4 protons on the disubstituted ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of these protons is a key clue to the substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n    *   For a ***para* (1,4) substitution**, the molecule is symmetrical. This high degree of symmetry results in a characteristic and simple pattern: **two doublets (d)**, where each doublet represents **2H**.\n    *   For *ortho* or *meta* substitution, the protons are less symmetrical, leading to more complex splitting patterns that would not be described as two simple doublets.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options**\n\nWe will now compare our prediction (a 3H singlet ~2.3 ppm and two 2H doublets in the aromatic region) with the choices.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches our prediction for the acetyl methyl group (a singlet, integrating to 3H, at the correct chemical shift).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 hydrogens, is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **This option is fully consistent with the structure of *p*-haloacetophenone.**\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. The compound also lacks the required 3H singlet. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A disubstituted benzene ring must have 4 protons in the aromatic region (typically >6.5 ppm). This spectrum does not show this. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic proton region. It cannot represent an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only data set that matches all the features deduced from the problem description is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two other groups (substituents) attached to it.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak indicates a **carbonyl group (C=O)**.\n    *   A peak indicates an **aromatic-halogen bond (C-X)**, meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Identify the Substituents and Propose a Structure:**\n\n*   Based on the FTIR data, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    1.  A halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    2.  A group containing the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's find a group with the formula C₂ and C=O. The most common and stable such group is the **acetyl group**, -C(=O)CH₃.\n*   Combining these pieces, the molecule is a **halo-acetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n    *   This structure has a di-substituted benzene ring. (✓)\n    *   It has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 total carbons. (✓)\n    *   It has a carbonyl group. (✓)\n    *   It has an aromatic-halogen bond. (✓)\n    *   The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means it should have 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the ring, 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**3. Analyze the Possible Isomers and Predict their ¹H NMR Spectra:**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can have three positional isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-isomers:** These isomers are asymmetric. They would have four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region (typically four separate signals with complex splitting like doublets, triplets, etc.).\n*   **Para-isomer:** The para-halo-acetophenone (4-halo-acetophenone) is highly symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-C4 axis.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs. The two protons next to the acetyl group (Hₐ) are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen (Hₑ) are equivalent.\n    *   The Hₐ protons will couple with their adjacent Hₑ protons, appearing as a **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The Hₑ protons will couple with their adjacent Hₐ protons, appearing as another **doublet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will not be split and will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n\n*   **Predicted ¹H NMR Spectrum for para-halo-acetophenone:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~7.5-8.0 ppm): One doublet (2H) and another doublet (2H).\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.0-2.5 ppm): One singlet (3H).\n    *   Total protons: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and a singlet in the aliphatic region for 3H.\n    *   The chemical shifts are appropriate: ~7.7 ppm for aromatic protons next to electron-withdrawing groups and ~2.3 ppm for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH₃).\n    *   This data is a perfect match for the predicted spectrum of **para-halo-acetophenone**.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest a structure like para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), which also fits the initial description.\n    *   However, in such a structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) should be split by the adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-), appearing as a triplet (t). Similarly, the methylene protons should be split by the aldehyde proton, appearing as a doublet (d). The data lists both as singlets (s), which is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons, which typically appear above 6.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not one. The chemical shifts are also not characteristic of the proposed aromatic structure. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting all the given criteria is A. The compound is a para-halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms total:** A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contribute a total of 2 carbons.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   Based on the constraints, one substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and the remaining two carbon atoms. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these parts, the molecule is a halo-acetophenone. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substitution Pattern and its NMR Signature:**\n    *   The problem describes a di-substituted ring, which can be ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-). The ¹H NMR splitting pattern of the aromatic protons is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution** would result in four distinct and complex signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Meta-substitution** would also result in complex patterns, typically with four signals (or three if one proton is uniquely isolated).\n    *   **Para-substitution (1,4-)** is the most symmetrical. It creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring. This results in two signals, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), which appear as doublets due to coupling with their single adjacent proton. This \"two doublets, each 2H\" pattern is highly characteristic of para-substitution.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the ¹H NMR Data Options:**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `7.8 ppm (2H, d)` and `7.6 ppm (2H, d)` are in the aromatic region and perfectly match the pattern for a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH₃) and the halogen are both electron-withdrawing, which shifts the aromatic protons downfield (greater than 7 ppm). The protons closer to the strongly withdrawing carbonyl group would be further downfield (around 7.8 ppm) than those closer to the halogen (around 7.6 ppm).\n        *   The signal at `2.3 ppm (3H, s)` corresponds to the three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) in the acetyl substituent. It is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with. Its chemical shift is typical for a methyl ketone.\n        *   This data is fully consistent with a 4'-haloacetophenone structure. For example, published data for 4'-chloroacetophenone shows peaks at δ 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.43 (d, 2H), and 2.59 (s, 3H), and data for 4'-bromoacetophenone shows peaks at δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), and 2.57 (s, 3H). The values in option A are very close to these experimental values.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts are too low for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals and their integrations do not match an aromatic compound with an acetyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 ppm` is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. An aldehyde-containing compound that fits the C8 and halogen requirement, such as a halomethylbenzaldehyde, would not have the specified aromatic-halogen bond. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only ¹H NMR data that correctly represents the structure of a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond (specifically a 4'-haloacetophenone) is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a detailed analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Molecular Clues\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. This leaves four protons on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** A benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 substituent C).\n*   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n*   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (like F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n### Step 2: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\nLet's combine the clues to build the molecule:\n*   We need two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain a carbonyl group and both substituents together must have a total of two carbon atoms.\n*   Since the halogen itself has no carbons, the carbonyl-containing substituent must have exactly two carbons.\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group. The total carbon count is 6 (benzene ring) + 2 (acetyl group) = 8, which matches the description.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Potential Isomers and their 1H NMR Spectra\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can have three possible arrangements: ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-isomers:** These arrangements are unsymmetrical and would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely appearing as complex multiplets.\n*   **Para-isomer:** The 1,4-substitution pattern is symmetrical. This symmetry results in a much simpler 1H NMR spectrum for the aromatic region. The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent in two sets of two. This typically gives rise to two distinct signals, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), and each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Given 1H NMR Options\n\nNow, let's compare the predicted spectra with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets (d) at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H, are the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet (s) at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3H, is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a carbonyl, as in an acetyl group. The chemical shift is in the expected range.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This data perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. For example, published data for 4-chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.90 (d, 2H), 7.44 (d, 2H), and 2.59 (s, 3H), and for 4-bromoacetophenone at δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), and 2.57 (s, 3H). The data in option A is highly consistent with these known values.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum suggests a para-substituted ring with an aldehyde group (δ 9.9 ppm) and a -CH₂- group (δ 3.7 ppm). This would correspond to a para-halophenylacetaldehyde. However, the methylene (-CH₂-) protons and the aldehyde (-CHO) proton would be coupled, leading to a doublet and a triplet respectively, not two singlets. This option is incorrect due to the splitting pattern.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons. This option only shows one proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with the required structure.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only option that correctly describes the compound is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the given information and then predict its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **1. Molecular Structure Determination**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The FTIR data shows the presence of a carbonyl group. This group accounts for one carbon atom.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** The FTIR data also indicates a halogen atom is directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\nBased on this, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A substituent containing one carbonyl group and the remaining carbon atom. This forms an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nThe molecule is therefore a haloacetophenone. The general formula is C₈H₇XO, which fits the provided information.\n\n### **2. ¹H NMR Spectrum Prediction**\n\nNow, we need to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. Let's consider the possible substitution patterns (ortho, meta, para) on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This group has three equivalent protons on the methyl group. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)**, integrating to **3H**. Due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group, its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.0–2.7 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** The benzene ring has four protons. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution:** Would result in four distinct and complex signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Meta-substitution:** Would also result in four distinct and complex signals.\n    *   **Para-substitution:** This pattern is highly symmetric. The four aromatic protons are present as two chemically equivalent sets. This leads to a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2H**. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are expected to be further downfield than the protons ortho to the halogen.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's compare our predictions with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). The singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl group next to a carbonyl. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Again, the signals are not in the expected regions, and the integration (2H singlet) does not match a methyl group. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a methyl ketone. The 2H singlet at 3.7 ppm is also inconsistent with an acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This signal perfectly matches the acetyl methyl group—a singlet integrating to 3H in the correct chemical shift region.\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for an aromatic ring substituted with an acetyl group and a halogen. For example, the ¹H NMR spectrum of 4-chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.57 (d, 2H), 7.09 (d, 2H), and 2.28 (s, 3H). While the exact shifts vary, the pattern described in option D is characteristic and correct.\n\nTherefore, the data in option D corresponds to a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
