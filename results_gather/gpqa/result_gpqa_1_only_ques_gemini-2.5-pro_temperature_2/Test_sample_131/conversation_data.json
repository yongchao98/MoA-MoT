    "This problem requires us to determine the composition of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds by analyzing its 1H NMR spectrum. The key is to first predict the individual 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the given spectral data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure and predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.**\n\nAll four compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a **singlet**. The integration will be for 2 protons (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**. The integration will be for 12 protons (12H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This will result in **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C3, and C5) are in different chemical environments. This will result in **four separate singlets**, each with an integration of 3H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to each other, but due to being in a symmetrical environment (an AA' system), they typically appear as a **single singlet**. The integration will be for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the C1/C4 pair. This will result in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (from two methyl groups).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The methylene protons (-CH2-) will couple to the methyl protons (-CH3), resulting in a **quartet** for the -CH2- and a **triplet** for the -CH3-. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture.\n    *   This eliminates option A.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the proposed mixtures based on the combined 1H NMR spectrum.**\n\nThe experimental spectrum for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\n\n**B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic:** Would have up to 3 signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB, and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match the observed 2 signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Would have up to 6 signals (two 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-TMB, and four 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic:** Would have up to 3 signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match the observed 2 signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Would have up to 5 signals (one 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, and four 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\nLet's analyze this 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Combined, we expect two singlets. Since the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2 protons, their integrals will be equal. This gives **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (each 6H).\n    *   Combined, we expect three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n\nConclusion: The mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly accounts for all features of the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
