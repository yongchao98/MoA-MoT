    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Partition Function**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1.\n*   The total number of possible microstates is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n*   The energy of any given state is given by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n*   The partition function (Z) is defined as the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for that state:\n    Z = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\n    where β = 1/(kT).\n\n    Since some states might have the same energy (i.e., they are degenerate), we can group them and write the partition function as a sum over unique energy levels:\n    Z = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n    where g(E) is the degeneracy of the energy level E (the number of states with that energy).\n\n**2. Enumerate States and Calculate Energies**\n\nWe need to consider all 8 possible configurations of (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the energy for each one. We can group them by the number of 'up' (+1) and 'down' (-1) spins.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are the same**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   These two states both have an energy of -3J. So, the energy level E₁ = -3J has a degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two spins are up (+1), one is down (-1)**\n    *   There are three such states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n    *   Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   By symmetry, all three of these states will have the same energy E = +J.\n\n*   **Case 3: One spin is up (+1), two are down (-1)**\n    *   There are three such states: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   Let's calculate the energy for one of them, e.g., (+1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   Again, by symmetry, all three of these states have the same energy E = +J.\n\n*   **Summary of Energy Levels and Degeneracies**\n    *   We have found two distinct energy levels:\n    *   Energy level E₁ = -3J, with degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n    *   Energy level E₂ = +J, with degeneracy g₂ = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   (Check: Total number of states = g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This is correct.)\n\n**3. Construct the Partition Function**\n\nNow we can write down the partition function by summing the contributions from each energy level:\n\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
