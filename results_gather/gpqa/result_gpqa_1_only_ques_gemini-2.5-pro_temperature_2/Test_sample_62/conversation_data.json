    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Understand the Model and the Initial State\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule XY using the quantum rotation-vibration model (also known as the non-rigid rotor model). The energy levels of this model are given by two quantum numbers:\n*   `v`, the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J`, the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n\nThe energy of a state (v, J) is:\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J*(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   B is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I)\n*   I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\nThe \"fundamental state\" is the ground state, which has the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both `v` and `J` are zero.\n*   Initial State: (v₀=0, J₀=0)\n*   Initial Energy: E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n\n### 2. Determine the Final State\n\nThe molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For a photon to be absorbed by a typical heteronuclear diatomic molecule (like XY), certain selection rules must be followed:\n*   Δv = +1 (This corresponds to the fundamental vibrational transition)\n*   ΔJ = ±1\n\nStarting from the initial state J₀=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is impossible (J cannot be negative). Therefore, the only allowed rotational change is ΔJ = +1.\n\nThis means the transition must be from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n*   Final State: (v₁, J₁) = (1, 1)\n*   Final Energy: E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B*1*(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n*Note: While a pure rotational transition (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1) would lead to a lower energy state, (v=0, J=1), the momentum for such a transition is much smaller than the given options, indicating that the problem is asking for the rovibrational transition.*\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon's Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate ħω and B.\n\n### 4. Calculate Physical Constants of the Molecule\n\n**a. Reduced Mass (μ):**\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\nμ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\nConvert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\nμ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Moment of Inertia (I):**\nI = μR²\nR = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\nI = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²)\nI = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Rotational Constant (B):**\nB = ħ² / (2I)\nB = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\nB = (1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (2.4152 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\nB ≈ 4.6 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**d. Vibrational Energy Quantum (ħω):**\nħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s)\nħω = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 5. Calculate Total Energy and Photon Momentum\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for the photon's energy:\nΔE = ħω + 2B\nΔE = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + 2 * (4.6 x 10⁻²³ J)\nΔE = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J)\nΔE ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\nFinally, the momentum (p) of a photon is related to its energy (E) by E = pc, where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\np = ΔE / c\np = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
