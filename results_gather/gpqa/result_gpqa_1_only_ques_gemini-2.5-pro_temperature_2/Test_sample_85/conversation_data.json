    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (contains only single bonds, except for the carbonyl).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position. The ring oxygen is O1. This structure is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n\nThe structure is a δ-lactone (formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid). The chiral center is C4, which bears the ethyl group. The reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this molecule.\n\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(=O)(2)  C(6)H₂\n    |          |\n   C(3)H₂----C(5)H₂\n       \\    /\n        C(4)H-CH₂CH₃  <-- Chiral Center\n```\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options propose starting materials of the type \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's parse this name:\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`, where iBu = isobutyl, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂). This compound is a monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n\nThe structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`.\nThe chiral center in the starting material is at C3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reactions and Stereochemistry**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding how the starting material is transformed into the product and what happens to the stereocenter.\n\n*   **Key Principle:** The reactions (reduction of carbonyls) and the subsequent lactonization occur at the ends of the molecule (C1 and C5). The stereocenter at C3 is not directly involved in any bond-breaking or bond-forming steps. Therefore, its stereochemical configuration (R or S) will be retained throughout the reaction.\n\n*   The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    `...-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-...` --> reduction & cyclization --> `...-C(=O)(2)-CH₂(3)-CH(Et)(4)-...`\n\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:**\n    *   To obtain an (R)-product, we must start with an (R)-starting material.\n    *   To obtain an (S)-product, we must start with an (S)-starting material.\n\n**4. Apply the Stereochemical Principle to Each Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    Since the product has the (R) configuration, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration.\n    **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Reaction B:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    Since the product has the (S) configuration, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration.\n    **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\n\nCombining our findings:\n*   A is the (R)-isomer.\n*   B is the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n---\n**Note on the Reaction Mechanisms (For deeper understanding):**\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters more readily than carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains. The resulting molecule, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone product. This pathway is straightforward.\n    `HOOC-...-COOiBu --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-...-CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> Lactone`\n\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane (BH₃) is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids much faster than esters. Naively, this would reduce the C1 acid to an alcohol, giving a 5-hydroxy ester (`HO-CH₂-...-COOiBu`). Cyclization of this molecule would lead to a 7-membered lactone, which contradicts the product given. However, in this specific substrate, a special mechanism occurs. The BH₃ first reacts with the carboxylic acid to form an acyloxyborane (`-COO-BH₂`). This group can then coordinate to the ester carbonyl oxygen, leading to a directed, intramolecular reduction of the ester group. Upon workup, the carboxylic acid is regenerated. The net result is the same as the LiBH₄ reaction: the ester is reduced, and the acid is available for lactonization.\n    `HOOC-...-COOiBu --(BH₃)--> HOOC-...-CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> Lactone`\n\nSince both reaction pathways lead to the same type of transformation (reduction of the ester and cyclization with the acid), our stereochemical analysis is robust and correct.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Selection:**\n\nBased on the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Reaction A: (R)-product from A implies A is (R).\n*   Reaction B: (S)-product from B implies B is (S).\n\nThis directly leads to the answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
