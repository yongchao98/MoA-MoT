    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the genetic interactions based on the phenotypes of single and double mutants. Let's break down the data.\n\n**1. Analyze the single mutants:**\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function leads to a 25% reduction in resistance.\n*   **g2 (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance. This indicates G2 plays an essential and critical role in the pathway.\n*   **g3 (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function leads to a 50% reduction in resistance.\n\nFrom this, G2 is the most crucial gene for resistance.\n\n**2. Analyze the double mutants to understand epistasis and other interactions.**\n*Epistasis* is a genetic interaction where one gene's mutation masks the effect of a mutation in another gene. The gene that does the masking is called epistatic.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). The `g1` mutation (which would normally result in 75% resistance) has no effect in the absence of G2. This means `g2` is epistatic to `g1`. This strongly suggests that G2 acts upstream of G1 in the resistance pathway, or is an absolutely essential component of the same pathway.\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). Similar to the case above, the `g3` mutation has no effect when G2 is also knocked out. This means `g2` is also epistatic to `g3`.\n*   **Conclusion about G2:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and we know one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream, G2 is the most likely candidate for this TF. It likely activates or is required for the function of both G1 and G3. This rules out option D, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n**3. Analyze the g1g3 double mutant.**\n*   **g1 mutant resistance:** 75% (a loss of 25%)\n*   **g3 mutant resistance:** 50% (a loss of 50%)\n*   **g1g3 double mutant resistance:** 10% (a loss of 90%)\n*   **Interaction:** If the genes acted independently and additively, the expected loss of resistance in the double mutant would be the sum of individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75%. The expected resistance would be 100% - 75% = 25%. However, the observed resistance is much lower (10%). This phenomenon, where the double mutant shows a much more severe phenotype than the combined effects of the single mutants, is called **synergistic interaction**. Synergy often indicates that the two genes have **partially redundant functions** or act in parallel pathways that converge. When one is lost, the other can partially compensate, but when both are lost, the system fails more dramatically than expected. Therefore, the conclusion that `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy` is strongly supported by the data. This points towards option C.\n\n**4. Evaluate the options based on the analysis.**\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy means a gene affects multiple traits. We only have data on one trait (resistance), so we cannot conclude this.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: For this to be true, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). This is false.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a plausible hypothesis for co-regulation by G2, but it cannot be directly concluded from this experiment.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: For this to be true, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). This is false.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a TF`: Correct, based on our epistasis analysis.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct, based on the synergistic interaction seen in the `g1g3` mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This part is incorrect, as shown above (10% ≠ 75%). However, the first two statements in this option are the most accurate and robust conclusions that can be drawn from the entire dataset. It is likely there is a flaw in this part of the question's option, but overall it remains the best description.\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a TF`: Incorrect. Our analysis showed G2 is upstream.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Unsubstantiated.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is actually correct (`g1g2` phenotype = `g2` phenotype), but the main premise that G1 is the TF is wrong.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nOption C provides the two most accurate conclusions derived from the experimental data: that G2 is a transcription factor (due to epistasis over G1 and G3) and that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (due to their synergistic interaction). Despite the final clause being incorrect based on a strict definition of epistasis, this option represents the best overall summary of the genetic relationships.\n\n<<<C>>>"
