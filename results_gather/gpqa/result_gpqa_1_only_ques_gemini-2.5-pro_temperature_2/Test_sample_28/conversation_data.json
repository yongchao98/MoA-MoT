  "question": "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen.

    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein is typically created by a mutation that drastically alters its structure or prevents its synthesis altogether.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by comparing the original DNA sequence to the mutant sequences. We will translate the DNA codons into amino acids. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’- ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... -3’\n*   **Codons:** ATG | TTT | CTC | GCT | GGT | ACT | ...\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met | Phe | Leu | Ala | Gly | Thr | ...\nThis is the sequence for the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’- ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Codons:** ATG | TTC | TAC | GCT | GGT | ACT | ...\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met | Phe | Tyr | Ala | Gly | Thr | ...\n*   **Analysis:** The third codon has changed from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially disrupt protein function, it might also have little or no effect. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’- ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Codons:** ATG | TTC | TAA | ...\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met | Phe | **STOP**\n*   **Analysis:** The third codon has changed from `CTC` to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. The resulting protein will be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and will be non-functional.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’\n*   **Codons:** ATG | TTT | TAC | GCT | GGT | GTC | ACT | ...\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met | Phe | Tyr | Ala | Gly | Val | Thr | ...\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence contains multiple changes compared to the intact gene. For example, the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon changes from `ACT` (Threonine) to `GTC` (Valine). These are multiple **missense mutations**. As with Mutant 1, a full-length protein is produced, and it's uncertain if these changes are enough to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... -3’\n*   **Codons:** ATG | TTT | TAC | GCT | ACT | TCT | GTG |...\n*   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...), we can see two changes. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine) - a **missense mutation**. Also, the fifth codon, `GGT`, has been deleted. This is a 3-base pair deletion, which results in the loss of one amino acid (Glycine) without changing the reading frame downstream (**in-frame deletion**). A full-length (minus one amino acid) protein with a substitution will be made, which may or may not be functional.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in missense mutations and/or an in-frame deletion. These create a full-length or nearly full-length protein with altered amino acid sequences. These proteins *might* be non-functional, but it is not a certainty.\n*   Mutant 2 results in a nonsense mutation, introducing a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This will produce a severely truncated and certainly non-functional protein.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most probable one to completely eliminate the synthesis of the functional protein and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
