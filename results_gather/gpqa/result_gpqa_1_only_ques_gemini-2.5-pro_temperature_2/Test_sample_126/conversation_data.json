    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Molecule:**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   `nona-`: A 9-carbon parent chain.\n    *   `-2,6-diene`: Double bonds are located starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6. The double bonds are C2=C3 and C6=C7.\n    *   `5-butyl-`: A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    Let's draw the structure:\n    ```\n             CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ (Butyl)\n             |\n    CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n      1   2  3   4   5  6  7   8   9\n    ```\n    This molecule has 9 carbons in the main chain and 4 in the butyl group, for a total of 13 carbons (C₁₃H₂₄).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    The problem states the molecule is \"heated\". For a diene, heating strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction. The most common pericyclic reaction for an acyclic diene is the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically the **Cope rearrangement**.\n\n3.  **Check the Requirements for a Cope Rearrangement:**\n    The Cope rearrangement occurs in **1,5-dienes**. A 1,5-diene has a structure of the form `C=C-C-C-C=C`, where the two double bonds are separated by a single C-C sigma bond (the C3-C4 bond in hexa-1,5-diene).\n\n    Let's examine our starting molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. The double bonds are at C2=C3 and C6=C7. The carbons separating them are C4 and C5. This forms a `C=C-C-C-C=C` skeleton. This type of diene is a **1,6-diene** (the starting carbons of the double bonds are C2 and C6, separated by 4 positions), not a 1,5-diene. A 1,6-diene cannot directly undergo a standard Cope rearrangement.\n\n4.  **Consider the Reversibility of the Cope Rearrangement:**\n    The Cope rearrangement is a reversible equilibrium reaction.\n    Reactant ⇌ Product\n    It is possible that the starting molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, is the *product* of a Cope rearrangement, and that one of the options is the *reactant*. Since the reaction is reversible, heating the product will drive the reaction back towards the reactant.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Options:**\n    Let's look for a 1,5-diene among the options which could be the Cope rearrangement partner of our starting molecule.\n    *   A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene: A 1,6-diene.\n    *   B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene: A **1,5-diene**.\n    *   C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene: (Same as A), a 1,6-diene.\n    *   D) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene: A 1,6-diene.\n\n    Option (B) is the only 1,5-diene, making it the only candidate that can directly undergo a Cope rearrangement.\n\n6.  **Perform the Cope Rearrangement on the Candidate Molecule (Option B):**\n    Let's draw 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene and see what product its Cope rearrangement yields.\n    *   `deca-`: A 10-carbon parent chain.\n    *   `-1,5-diene`: Double bonds at C1=C2 and C5=C6.\n    *   `3-methyl`, `4-ethyl`: Substituents at C3 and C4.\n\n    Structure of (B):\n    ```\n            CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n            |     |\n    CH₂=CH - CH - CH - CH=CH - CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n      1  2   3    4    5  6      7  8  9  10\n    ```\n    This molecule has 10 carbons in the main chain + 1 (methyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 13 carbons (C₁₃H₂₄), matching our starting material.\n\n    Now, let's perform the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement on its hexa-1,5-diene core (C1 to C6).\n    *   **Bond breaking:** The C3-C4 sigma bond breaks.\n    *   **Bond forming:** A new sigma bond forms between C1 and C6.\n    *   **Pi bond shift:** The pi bonds shift from C1=C2 and C5=C6 to C2=C3 and C4=C5.\n\n    Let's trace the atoms to form the new product structure:\n    *   The methyl group on C3 and the C1-C2 part of the old chain will form one end of the new product chain: `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-`.\n    *   The ethyl group on C4 and the C5-C6 part of the old chain will form the other end: `-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The fragment `-(CH₂)₃CH₃` (butyl tail) was on C6. C6 is now bonded to C1. This C1-C6 link connects the two new ends, with the butyl tail still attached to C6.\n\n    Let's assemble the product molecule from these transformations:\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-` (from Me,C3,C2) + `-CH₂-` (from C1) + `-CH(C₄H₉)-` (from C6 + tail) + `-CH=CH-` (from C5,C4) + `-CH₂CH₃` (from Et)\n\n    Combining these gives:\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(C₄H₉)-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`\n\n    Let's name this product:\n    *   The longest carbon chain contains 9 carbons. -> **nona-**\n    *   The double bonds start at C2 and C6. -> **-2,6-diene**\n    *   A butyl group is on C5. -> **5-butyl-**\n    The product is **5-butylnona-2,6-diene**, which is exactly our starting molecule.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction is a reversible Cope rearrangement:\n    4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene (B)  ⇌  5-butylnona-2,6-diene (Starting Molecule)\n    Heating the starting molecule will shift the equilibrium, forming its Cope rearrangement partner. Therefore, heating 5-butylnona-2,6-diene will produce 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
