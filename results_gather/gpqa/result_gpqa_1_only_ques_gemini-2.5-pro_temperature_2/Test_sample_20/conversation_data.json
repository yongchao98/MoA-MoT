    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n    *   These α-carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have any α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, which is required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. The system is a stable conjugated diene-dione.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The hydrogens on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are α-hydrogens. In fact, they are doubly activated because each of these carbons is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, making the hydrogens very acidic and easily removed.\n    *   This compound readily undergoes tautomerization to form its enol form, **phloroglucinol (benzene-1,3,5-triol)**. The enol form is aromatic, which makes it extremely stable and the predominant form of the compound.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows extensive tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the trans-isomer of an alkene: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It has no chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   Since it has elements of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
