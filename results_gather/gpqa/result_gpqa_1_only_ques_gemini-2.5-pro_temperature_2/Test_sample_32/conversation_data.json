    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the EXO product of the given [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Diene:** 2,5-dimethylthiophene. This is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle that can act as a 4π electron component in a Diels-Alder reaction. The diene system consists of atoms C2, C3, C4, and C5. The methyl groups at positions 2 and 5 are electron-donating, which facilitates the reaction.\n*   **Dienophile:** Furan-2,5-dione, commonly known as maleic anhydride. It is a highly reactive 2π electron component due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two carbonyl groups conjugated with the double bond.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction) promoted by heat.\n\n**2. Determine the Connectivity of the Product**\nIn this Diels-Alder reaction:\n*   New sigma (σ) bonds form between C2 of the thiophene and one carbon of the maleic anhydride's double bond, and between C5 of the thiophene and the other carbon of the maleic anhydride's double bond.\n*   A new pi (π) bond forms between C3 and C4 of the original thiophene ring.\n*   This creates a bicyclic product. The sulfur atom from the thiophene forms a bridge across the newly formed six-membered ring. This is known as an **epithio** bridge.\n*   The maleic anhydride part becomes a fused anhydride ring.\n*   The product can be named as a derivative of isobenzofuran-1,3-dione. The addition of the thiophene results in a **4,7-epithio-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydroisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** core structure. The methyl groups from the diene are located at the bridgehead carbons, C4 and C7.\n\nBased on this structural analysis, we can eliminate options A and B because they describe an \"epoxy\" bridge (an oxygen bridge), which is incorrect. The bridge is formed by the sulfur atom from thiophene, making it an \"epithio\" bridge.\n\nThis leaves us with options C and D:\nC) (3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\nD) (3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (EXO vs. ENDO)**\nThe question explicitly asks for the **EXO product**.\n*   In the context of Diels-Alder reactions involving bridged systems, the EXO adduct is the one where the dienophile's substituents (here, the anhydride ring) are oriented *anti* (away from) the main bridge (the sulfur bridge).\n*   The EXO product is generally the thermodynamically more stable product due to reduced steric hindrance. Given that the reaction is conducted with heat, the formation of the thermodynamic product is favored.\n\n**4. Determine the Relative Stereochemistry of the EXO Adduct**\n*   **Symmetry:** Both reactants, 2,5-dimethylthiophene (C₂ᵥ) and maleic anhydride (C₂ᵥ), are symmetrical. The reaction is expected to proceed in a way that forms a symmetrical product.\n*   **Methyl Group Orientation:** For the EXO adduct, there are two main possibilities for the methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons (C4 and C7). They can be both *syn* (on the same side) or both *anti* (on the opposite side) to the sulfur bridge. The *anti* orientation would place them in close proximity to the bulky anhydride ring, causing significant steric strain. Therefore, the favored conformation is where both methyl groups are *syn* to the sulfur bridge.\n*   **Meso Compound:** In the EXO adduct where both methyl groups are *syn* to the S-bridge, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the S-bridge, the C5=C6 double bond, and the anhydride ring. This makes the product a **meso** compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having stereocenters.\n*   **Stereodescriptors for a Meso Compound:** In a meso compound with stereocenters related by a plane of symmetry, the stereocenters must have opposite R/S configurations. For our product, this means that C4 and C7 must be a pair (R,S) or (S,R), and C3a and C7a must also be a pair (R,S) or (S,R).\n    *   Option C: (3aR, 7aS) and (4S, 7R). This is consistent with a meso compound.\n    *   Option D: (3aR, 7aS) and (4R, 7S). This is also consistent with a meso compound.\n\n**5. Applying IUPAC Naming Rules to Differentiate C and D**\nBoth C and D describe a meso compound. They represent two possible diastereomers, but we have established that the sterically favored product has both methyl groups *syn* to the S-bridge. The remaining challenge is to determine the correct IUPAC name for this specific meso adduct.\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules for stereoisomers, when a choice exists in numbering, the numbering scheme is chosen to give the 'R' configuration the lowest possible locant.\n*   The numbering of the carbons in the outer ring (C4, C5, C6, C7) can proceed in two directions.\n*   Let's compare the descriptors for the bridgehead carbons C4 and C7 in the options.\n    *   **Option C:** (4S, 7R). The R configuration has the higher number (7).\n    *   **Option D:** (4R, 7S). The R configuration has the lower number (4).\n\nAccording to the IUPAC rule, option D is the correctly formulated name. Even without explicitly assigning the R/S configuration from first principles (which is complex), we can deduce that the correct name for the meso compound must follow this convention. Option C violates this rule and would be corrected to an equivalent (4R, 7S) name by re-numbering. Therefore, D is the correct choice.\n\nFinal Answer is D. It correctly identifies the core structure as an epithio-bridged adduct, and it provides the stereochemical descriptor for the meso-EXO product that follows standard IUPAC naming conventions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
