    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. The Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    ```\n          Br\n        /\n       (C1)\n      //  \\\\\n    (C2)-D (C6)-H\n     |    |\n    (C3)-H (C5)-H\n      \\\\  //\n       (C4)\n        |\n        H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). This is a very strong base and the classic condition for promoting an elimination-addition reaction on an aryl halide, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In our substrate, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n*   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nBecause the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, abstracting the proton (H) from C6 is kinetically favored over abstracting the deuteron (D) from C2. This is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE). However, both pathways are possible, and since the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider both.\n\n*   **Path A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  NH2⁻ removes the H from C6.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  NH2⁻ removes the D from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Formation of Final Products)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH2⁻) attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **From Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 makes this intermediate unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** NH2⁻ adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the -D at C2. This is **aniline-2-d**. (Product 1)\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** NH2⁻ adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the -D at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (C1'), the deuterium atom is at C3'. This product is **aniline-3-d**. (Product 2)\n\n*   **From Intermediate B (Benzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. This intermediate is symmetrical.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group on the ring and only hydrogens at all other positions. This is **aniline**. (Product 3)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have identified three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  Aniline-2-d\n2.  Aniline-3-d\n3.  Aniline\n\nThese three are different molecules (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
