    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify the final product, followed by an analysis of its structure to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂)\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Under neutral or acidic conditions, this reaction proceeds via an enol intermediate and typically results in monohalogenation at the alpha-position. The two alpha-positions (C2 and C6) of cyclohexanone are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** An α-haloketone treated with a strong base undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. The base removes an acidic proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the strained ring opens, leading to a ring contraction. The initial 6-membered ring becomes a 5-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   An alternative E2 elimination reaction to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely to be the intended pathway because the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride is characteristic for carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 3: 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid (-COOH) into an acid chloride (-COCl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Let's analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\nStructure:\n      H(a) O\n       \\ //\n        C--C1--H(b)\n          /   \\\n  (d)H-C2---C5-H(f)\n  (c)H-/     \\-H(e)\n      |       |\n  (h)H-C3-----C4-H(g)\n       \\-H(j) /-H(i)\n        \\---/\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry (Cₛ) that passes through the aldehyde group (C, O, H(a)), the C1 carbon, its hydrogen (H(b)), and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nThis plane of symmetry makes certain atoms and groups equivalent:\n*   Carbon C2 is equivalent to Carbon C5.\n*   Carbon C3 is equivalent to Carbon C4.\n*   Hydrogen atoms on C2 are equivalent to their corresponding counterparts on C5.\n*   Hydrogen atoms on C3 are equivalent to their corresponding counterparts on C4.\n\nLet's count the sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (H(a)):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. It lies on the plane of symmetry. This is one distinct set. (1H)\n2.  **Methine proton on C1 (H(b)):** This proton is attached to the ring carbon that bears the aldehyde group. It is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a second distinct set. (1H)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The two protons on C2 (H(c) and H(d)) are diastereotopic. This is because they are on a carbon adjacent to a prochiral center (C1), and they have different spatial relationships to the substituent on C1. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Similarly, the two protons on C5 (H(e) and H(f)) are diastereotopic. Due to the plane of symmetry, H(c) is equivalent to H(f), and H(d) is equivalent to H(e). This gives us two more distinct sets of protons.\n    *   Set 3: {H(d), H(e)} (2H)\n    *   Set 4: {H(c), H(f)} (2H)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similar to the above, the two protons on C3 (H(h) and H(j)) are diastereotopic. The two protons on C4 (H(g) and H(i)) are also diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes H(h) equivalent to H(g), and H(j) equivalent to H(i). This gives us another two distinct sets of protons.\n    *   Set 5: {H(h), H(g)} (2H)\n    *   Set 6: {H(j), H(i)} (2H)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\n1.  H(a)\n2.  H(b)\n3.  {H(d), H(e)}\n4.  {H(c), H(f)}\n5.  {H(h), H(g)}\n6.  {H(j), H(i)}\n\nThus, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
