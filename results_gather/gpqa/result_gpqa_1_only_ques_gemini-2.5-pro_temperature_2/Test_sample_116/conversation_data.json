    "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. The positions adjacent to this bond (ortho positions: 2, 2', 6, 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The steric hindrance caused by these four bulky ortho-substituents prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, combined with the lack of a plane of symmetry in the molecule, leads to a type of chirality called atropisomerism. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. Therefore, it is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon). Any molecule with a single chiral center is chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is diphenyl ketone, (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Chirality:** The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three atoms (two carbons and one oxygen), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, it has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and contains the C=O group. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
