    "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field and the Integral**\n\nThe vector field is given as `f(r)`.\n*   It is purely radial, so it can be written as `f(r) = f(r) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   The magnitude is given by `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n*   Therefore, the vector field is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`.\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, over a sphere `V` of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that for a suitable vector field `f` and a volume `V` bounded by a closed surface `S`:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nThis theorem converts the volume integral of the divergence into a surface integral of the flux through the boundary of the volume. This is often easier to calculate.\n\n*   The volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n**Important Note:** The vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where it is undefined. The Divergence Theorem technically requires the field to be well-behaved everywhere inside the volume. However, the theorem can still be used, and it correctly captures the contribution from the singularity, which can be thought of as a \"source\" at the origin. The standard physical interpretation (like with Gauss's Law for a point charge) relies on this application.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nLet's compute the flux `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So the field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere in spherical coordinates points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, the vector `dS` is `dS = r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n*   Now, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   Finally, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   Now, integrate with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of the surface integral is `4π`. By the Divergence Theorem, this is also the value of the volume integral of the divergence:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`), because the source of the divergence is concentrated entirely at the origin.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
