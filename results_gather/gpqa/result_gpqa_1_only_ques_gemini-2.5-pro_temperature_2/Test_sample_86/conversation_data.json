    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we start with a benzene ring (C6H4) that has two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have a halogen (-X) as one substituent. This substituent contains 0 carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Combining these parts, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n3.  **Predict the General 1H NMR Spectrum for Haloacetophenone:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry if it is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). *Ortho* (1,2) and *meta* (1,3) substitutions would lead to more complex spectra with 4 distinct aromatic signals.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the benzene ring. Their chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, typically δ 7.0 - 8.5 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not adjacent to any protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift is typically around δ 2.5 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        This spectrum is inconsistent. It shows only one aromatic proton, and the other signals do not match our predicted structure. The total proton count is 7H, which is correct, but the splitting and chemical shifts are wrong. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. A possible structure would be a halophenylacetaldehyde, which fits the carbon count and substituent types. However, the aromatic signals (two doublets) suggest a *para* substitution. For a phenylacetaldehyde, the carbonyl group is not directly conjugated with the ring, so its electron-withdrawing effect is much weaker. The aromatic protons would be expected at a lower chemical shift (closer to 7.2-7.4 ppm), not as far downfield as 7.6-7.8 ppm. This option is less likely.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets (d) at δ 7.8 ppm and δ 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet (s) at δ 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is a perfect match for an **acetyl methyl group (-COCH3)**.\n        *   **Overall Fit:** This spectrum corresponds perfectly to a *para*-haloacetophenone. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing and conjugated with the ring, which explains the downfield shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        This spectrum shows no signals in the aromatic region (δ 7-8 ppm), which contradicts the problem description of an aromatic compound. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption C provides the NMR data that is most consistent with the described molecule, *p*-haloacetophenone. The spectrum clearly shows the characteristic signals for a *para*-substituted aromatic ring and an acetyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
