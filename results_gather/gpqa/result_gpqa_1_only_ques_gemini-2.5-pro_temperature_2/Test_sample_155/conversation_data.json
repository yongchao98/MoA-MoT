    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n          CH3CH2CH2   H\n                     \\ /\n                      C=C\n                     / \\\n                    H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction is a stereospecific *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The stereochemical rule for epoxidation is: a *trans*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene reacts to form a 1:1 mixture of (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** The epoxide is protonated and then attacked by a water molecule. This attack occurs via an Sâ‚™2 mechanism, which means it is an *anti*-addition (the water molecule attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond).\n    *   The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: an anti-addition to the racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides (which came from a *trans*-alkene) results in a meso compound.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        *   (4R, 5R)-epoxide undergoes anti-opening to yield (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound).\n        *   (4S, 5S)-epoxide also undergoes anti-opening to yield (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (which is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n          CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                     \\ /\n                      C=C\n                     / \\\n                    H   H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: a *cis*-alkene yields a meso epoxide.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts to form meso-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is (4R, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** This is an *anti*-addition, just as in Reaction 1.\n    *   The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: an anti-addition to a meso-epoxide (which came from a *cis*-alkene) results in a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        *   Attack at carbon C4 (which is R) of the meso-epoxide inverts its configuration to S, giving the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at carbon C5 (which is S) of the meso-epoxide inverts its configuration to R, giving the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n    *   Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, the product is a 1:1 racemic mixture of **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These are two enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) are enantiomers.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) compounds.\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\nThe mixture of these three stereoisomers is analyzed by two HPLC methods.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time. The two enantiomers ((4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S)) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   In this chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase and can be separated. They will have different retention times.\n    *   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n    *   Given that the resolution is \"as high as theoretically possible,\" all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
