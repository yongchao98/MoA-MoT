    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C bonds in an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** The broad singlet (bs) in this region (10-13 ppm) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH group). The upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm indicates protons ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Side Chain:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to at least two different types of protons.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is a methine group (-CH-) adjacent to several other protons. The downfield shift suggests it is benzylic (attached to the benzene ring).\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n        1.  We have a benzene ring with a -COOH group.\n        2.  There is another substituent at the para (4) position.\n        3.  Let's piece together the alkyl group: We have a -CH group, a -CH₂ group, and two -CH₃ groups.\n            *   The -CH- is bonded to a -CH₃ (giving the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n            *   The -CH₂- is bonded to a -CH₃ (giving the 0.9 ppm triplet).\n            *   If the -CH- is bonded to the -CH₂-, we form a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        4.  This sec-butyl group is attached to the benzene ring at the benzylic position (the -CH- group), which is consistent with the 2.9 ppm chemical shift.\n        5.  Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent, particularly known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups (aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) down to the corresponding alkane.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The benzene ring will have a sec-butyl group and a methyl group at the 1 and 4 positions. The name of the product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group isomer.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is reduced, not retained.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the structure of our predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
