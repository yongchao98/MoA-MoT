    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the coupled angular momentum state $|l, m>$ and the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The 2-electron system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum, $L_z$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measured Quantities:** We are measuring the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenvalues of these operators are $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ respectively.\n\n3.  **Identify the Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to the final state where:\n    *   $m_1 = -1$ (since $m_1\\hbar = -\\hbar$)\n    *   $m_2 = -1$ (since $m_2\\hbar = -\\hbar$)\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the coupling of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n5.  **Analyze the States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The system is in a state with a total z-component quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   **Final (Measured) State:** The desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state with individual quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. For this outcome, the total z-component quantum number would be $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The initial state has a total $m = -1$, while the desired final state has a total $m = -2$. Due to the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during a measurement that projects onto the $|m_1, m_2>$ basis, it is impossible for a system in a state with $m = -1$ to be found in a state with a combined $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. The transition is forbidden.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is zero. The coupled state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not part of this superposition.\n\n<<<B>>>"
