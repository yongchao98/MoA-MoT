    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order:\n\n**Understanding the Reaction and Directing Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring dictates where the incoming bromine atom will attach (ortho, meta, or para position) and how fast the reaction occurs.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves. These are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups -CH3, -C2H5) or halogens (-Cl).\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position (one carbon away). These are typically deactivating groups with double or triple bonds connected to the ring (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR).\n\n**General Principle for Para-Isomer Yield**\n\n1.  Ortho, para-directors will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n2.  Meta-directors will produce very little of the para-isomer, with the vast majority being the meta-isomer.\n\nTherefore, the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear first in the list of increasing yield.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents**\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:**\n    1.  C6H5-CH3 (-CH3, methyl)\n    3.  C6H5-Cl (-Cl, chloro)\n    5.  C6H5-C2H5 (-C2H5, ethyl)\n*   **Meta-directors:**\n    2.  C6H5-COOC2H5 (-COOC2H5, ethoxycarbonyl)\n    4.  C6H5-NO2 (-NO2, nitro)\n    6.  C6H5-COOH (-COOH, carboxyl)\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (4, 2, 6) by Increasing Para Yield**\n\nFor meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\n*   **-NO2 (4):** The strongest deactivator, gives the least amount of para product.\n*   **-COOH (6):** Strongly deactivating, but less so than -NO2. Gives more para product than nitrobenzene.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2):** Slightly less deactivating than -COOH. Gives slightly more para product than benzoic acid.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 3, 5) by Increasing Para Yield**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric bulk makes it more difficult for the bromine to attack the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring attack at the more accessible para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n    *   Yield(para): 1 < 5\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5):** Halogens like chlorine have a very strong preference for para substitution. This is due to a combination of steric hindrance and the strong, distance-dependent inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), which deactivates the closer ortho positions more than the farther para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high para/ortho ratio. The para yield for chlorobenzene (~88%) is significantly higher than for toluene (~62%) or ethylbenzene (~64%).\n    *   Yield(para): (1, 5) < 3\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nThe meta-directors have the lowest para yields, and the ortho, para-directors have the highest. Combining the orders from Step 2 and Step 3:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order from lowest to highest weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
