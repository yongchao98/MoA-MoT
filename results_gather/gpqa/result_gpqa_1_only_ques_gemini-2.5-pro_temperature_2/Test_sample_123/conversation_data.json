    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and radioactive decay. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### 1. The Physics of Particle Decay\n\nThe decay of a population of unstable particles follows the exponential decay law:\n$N(t) = N_0 * e^{-t / \\tau_{lab}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $N(t)$ is the number of particles remaining at time $t$.\n*   $N_0$ is the initial number of particles.\n*   $\\tau_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 2. Time Dilation\n\nBecause the particles are traveling at ultra-relativistic speeds, their internal clocks run slower from our perspective in the lab. This effect is called time dilation. The mean lifetime measured in the lab ($\\tau_{lab}$) is related to the particle's intrinsic or \"proper\" lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma * \\tau$\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation gives:\n$N(t) = N_0 * e^{-t / (\\gamma * \\tau)}$\n\n### 3. Time of Flight\n\nThe particles are created at the center of the detector and must travel a distance equal to the radius, R = 30 meters, to reach the inner walls. Since they move at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed is approximately the speed of light, $v \\approx c$.\nThe time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n$t = R / v \\approx R / c$\n\n### 4. Fraction of Surviving Particles\n\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector is the number that survive the journey of time $t = R/c$. We find this by substituting the time of flight into our decay equation:\n$N/N_0 = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma\\tau)} = e^{-R / (c\\gamma\\tau)}$\n\nThis is our main equation. It links the survival fraction ($N/N_0$) to the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) and some constants (R, c, $\\tau$).\n\n### 5. Solving the Problem\n\nLet's apply this equation to the two scenarios given.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1 = 20$.\n*   Survival fraction, $N_1/N_0 = 1/3$.\n*   Detector Radius, R = 30 m.\n\nPlugging these in:\n$1/3 = e^{-R / (c * 20 * \\tau)}$\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2 = ?$.\n*   Survival fraction, $N_2/N_0 = 2/3$.\n*   Detector Radius, R = 30 m.\n\nPlugging these in:\n$2/3 = e^{-R / (c * \\gamma_2 * \\tau)}$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. Let's take the natural logarithm of both:\n1.  $\\ln(1/3) = -R / (c * 20 * \\tau)$\n2.  $\\ln(2/3) = -R / (c * \\gamma_2 * \\tau)$\n\nNotice that the term $-R / (c\\tau)$ is common to both equations. Let's find its value from the first equation:\n$-R / (c\\tau) = 20 * \\ln(1/3)$\n$-R / (c\\tau) = -20 * \\ln(3)$\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n$\\ln(2/3) = [-20 * \\ln(3)] / \\gamma_2$\n\nFinally, we can solve for the unknown Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{-20 * \\ln(3)}{\\ln(2/3)}$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{-20 * \\ln(3)}{\\ln(2) - \\ln(3)}$\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{20 * \\ln(3)}{\\ln(3) - \\ln(2)}$\nAlso, $\\ln(3) - \\ln(2) = \\ln(3/2)$. So:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{20 * \\ln(3)}{\\ln(3/2)}$\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical value:\n*   $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$\n*   $\\ln(3/2) = \\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.4055$\n\n$\\gamma_2 \\approx \\frac{20 * 1.0986}{0.4055} \\approx 54.19$\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to 54.\n\nTo increase the fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector from 1/3 to 2/3, we must increase their lifetime in the lab frame. This requires increasing their Lorentz factor. Our result ($\\gamma_2 \\approx 54.2$) is indeed higher than the initial factor of 20, which confirms our physical intuition. Comparing our result to the given options, 54 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
