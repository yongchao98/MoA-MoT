    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n### Reaction 1:\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base (NaOEt) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon to form the enolate nucleophile, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (α,β-unsaturated carbonyl):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH).\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    2.  A new C-C bond is formed between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    4.  Protonation of the α-carbon gives the final product **A**.\n*   **Product A Structure:** `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Naming Product A:** This compound can be named as a substituted propane-tricarboxylate. The main chain is C1-C2-C3, corresponding to the malonate carbon, the β-carbon of the acrylate, and the α-carbon of the acrylate, respectively. The three methyl carboxylate groups (`-COOCH₃`) and the p-tolyl group are substituents. A plausible (though non-systematic) IUPAC name is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. Comparing this to the other option `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate` which would correspond to `p-Tolyl-CH₂-CH(COOCH₃)-CH(COOCH₃)₂`, the first name corresponds to the correct product structure.\n\n### Reaction 2:\nThis reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, which proceeds via a Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is a nitrogen analog of an enol. The β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is nucleophilic.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The structure is CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile, forming a new C-C bond.\n    2.  An iminium ion intermediate is formed.\n    3.  The final step is hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This step hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Structure:** The piperidine is removed, and a ketone is formed at C1 of the cyclohexane ring. The substituent from the butenenitrile, `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`, is attached at C2 (the α-position to the new ketone). The product is a 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n*   **Naming Product B:** The structure is a butanenitrile with a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group at position 3. Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name given in the options, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, corresponds to the enol tautomer, but the keto form is the major stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction 3:\nThis problem requires working backward from the product to identify the reactant C.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n    2.  The product structure is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring substituted at the C2 position. The substituent is a `-(CH₂)₂C(=O)CH₃` group, which is called a 3-oxobutyl group.\n    3.  This `3-oxobutyl` group is formed from the Michael acceptor, `but-3-en-2-one` (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`), after it accepts a nucleophile and a proton.\n    4.  Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant **C**) must be the molecule that provides the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring and attacks from the C2 position.\n*   **Reactant C:** The C2 position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is an \"active methylene\" group, flanked by two carbonyls, making its protons highly acidic. In the presence of a base (KOH), this carbon is easily deprotonated to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which acts as the Michael donor. Thus, reactant **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n*   **B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n*   **C** is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
