    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the products of decomposition and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is passed through three tubes. We can identify what each tube absorbs and calculate the amount of each gaseous product.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper oxide (CuO). The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have reacted.\n    *   Mass increase = mass of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule (O₂) in the gas mixture, the moles of O₂ gas are:\n        Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This gas passed through all three tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**Summary of products:**\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of Gas C\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the original mixture.**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the gaseous products must have come from the original salts A and B.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Comes from H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Element in Gas C:** Let's calculate the mass of H and O.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Total initial mass was 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C's element(s) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   We have 0.10 mol of Gas C, with a mass of 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   The unreactive gas (passed through hot copper) with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol, formed from heating a salt, is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Therefore, Gas C is N₂.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.25 mol of O, and 0.20 mol of N.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\n*   The problem states the salts A and B are in an **equimolar mixture**. Let's say there are 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B.\n*   The salts completely decompose into gases (H₂O, O₂, N₂). This is characteristic of certain ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. Common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   **Salt A: NH₄NO₂** (Ammonium nitrite)\n        *   Formula: N₂H₄O₂. Atomic count: 2 N, 4 H, 2 O.\n        *   Decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   **Salt B: NH₄NO₃** (Ammonium nitrate)\n        *   Formula: N₂H₄O₃. Atomic count: 2 N, 4 H, 3 O.\n        *   Strong heating/decomposition: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\n*   Now, let's assume we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B and see if the product ratios match our findings.\n    *   From `n` mol of NH₄NO₂: `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n    *   From `n` mol of NH₄NO₃: `n` mol N₂ (`n/2 * 2`), `0.5n` mol O₂ (`n/2 * 1`), and `2n` mol H₂O (`n/2 * 4`).\n    *   **Total moles of products:**\n        *   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n        *   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 + `0.5n` = `0.5n`\n\n*   We compare this with the experimental moles:\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.10 mol  =>  2n = 0.10  =>  n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.20 mol =>  4n = 0.20  =>  n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol => 0.5n = 0.025 =>  n = 0.05 mol.\n    The value `n = 0.05` is consistent for all products, confirming our choice of salts.\n\n*   **Final mass check:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (from NH₄) + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen (from NO₂) + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (from NH₄) + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen (from NO₃) + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
