    "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge is placed inside the sphere such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\nThe properties of the image charge `q'` are:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Position:** It is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center to the original charge `q`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe total potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. An equivalent and often simpler method is to use the formula for electrostatic energy:\n\n`U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`\n\nFor a system of a point charge and a charged surface, this becomes:\n\n`U = (1/2) * [q * V_other + ∫ σ * V_surface dS]`\n\nWhere:\n*   `q` is the point charge.\n*   `V_other` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n*   `σ` is the induced surface charge density on the sphere.\n*   `V_surface` is the potential on the surface of the sphere.\n\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_surface` is zero. Therefore, the integral term is zero. The formula simplifies to:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_other`\n\n**3. Finding V_other**\n\n`V_other` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d` from the center) created by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this potential is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n*   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   The original charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n\nThe potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n\n`V_other = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n`V_other = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the potential equation:\n\n`V_other = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\n`V_other = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Energy Calculation**\n\nNow substitute this potential `V_other` back into the simplified energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
