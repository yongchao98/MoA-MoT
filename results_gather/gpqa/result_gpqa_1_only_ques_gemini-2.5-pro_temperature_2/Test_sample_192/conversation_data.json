    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax ($plx$) as $1/plx^5$. Let's use the variable 'p' for parallax. This statement means that the number of stars found within a small range of parallax, from $p$ to $p+dp$, which we can denote as $N(p)dp$, is proportional to $\\frac{1}{p^5}dp$.\n    Mathematically:\n    $N(p) \\propto \\frac{1}{p^5}$\n    where $N(p)$ is the number of stars per unit parallax.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, $r$ (per unit range of distance). This means we want to find the function $N(r)$, which represents the number of stars per unit distance, such that the number of stars in a small distance range $dr$ is $N(r)dr$.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The relationship between distance ($r$) and parallax ($p$) is inverse:\n    $p = \\frac{1}{r}$\n\n4.  **Transform the Distribution:**\n    The number of stars in a particular set is constant, regardless of whether we describe them by their distance or their parallax. Therefore, the number of stars in a small distance interval $dr$ must equal the number of stars in the corresponding parallax interval $dp$. Since distance increases as parallax decreases, one of $dr$ or $dp$ will be negative, so we must use their absolute values.\n    $N(r)dr = N(p)|dp|$\n\n    To find the relationship between $dr$ and $dp$, we differentiate the distance-parallax equation ($p = 1/r$):\n    $\\frac{dp}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}(r^{-1}) = -r^{-2} = -\\frac{1}{r^2}$\n\n    This gives us the relationship between the small intervals:\n    $dp = -\\frac{1}{r^2} dr$\n    And for their magnitudes:\n    $|dp| = \\frac{1}{r^2} dr$\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we can substitute the known relationships into our conservation equation, $N(r)dr = N(p)|dp|$:\n    \n    *   We know $N(p) \\propto \\frac{1}{p^5}$.\n    *   We know $|dp| = \\frac{1}{r^2} dr$.\n\n    Substitute these into the right side of the equation:\n    $N(r)dr \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{p^5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{r^2}dr\\right)$\n\n    To get everything in terms of $r$, we replace $p$ with $1/r$:\n    $N(r)dr \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{(1/r)^5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{r^2}dr\\right)$\n    $N(r)dr \\propto (r^5) \\left(\\frac{1}{r^2}dr\\right)$\n    $N(r)dr \\propto \\frac{r^5}{r^2}dr$\n    $N(r)dr \\propto r^3 dr$\n\n    This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance, $N(r)$, is proportional to $r^3$.\n\nSo, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as ~$r^3$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
