    "Here's a breakdown of the options to determine which planet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially Earth, which serves as our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** With the same composition but less mass, the force of gravity is weaker. This means the planet's materials are less compressed, resulting in a *lower* density than Earth.\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is the key. While the planet is made of the same materials as Earth, its significantly greater mass (5 times) means it has much stronger self-gravity. This intense gravity compresses the core and mantle materials far more tightly than on Earth. This gravitational compression leads to a significantly *higher* overall density.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n\nTherefore, the planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth will be the densest due to gravitational compression.\n\nThe correct choice is D, which corresponds to planet c.\n\n<<<D>>>"
