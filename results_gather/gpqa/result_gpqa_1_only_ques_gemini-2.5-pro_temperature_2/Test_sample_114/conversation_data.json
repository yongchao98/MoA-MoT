    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the System and Initial State\n\nLet's denote the rest mass of both the electron and the positron as $m$. The rest energy is $E_0 = mc^2$. The problem is set up along the horizontal x-axis.\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   It moves from left to right (positive x-direction).\n    *   Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   Its total energy is $E_e = \\gamma_e mc^2 = 4mc^2$.\n    *   To find its momentum, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   $(p_e c)^2 = E_e^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (4mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = 16(mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = 15(mc^2)^2$.\n    *   The momentum magnitude is $p_e c = \\sqrt{15} mc^2$, so $p_e = \\sqrt{15} mc$.\n    *   Since it moves in the positive x-direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_e = (\\sqrt{15} mc, 0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   It moves from right to left (negative x-direction).\n    *   Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   Its total energy is $E_p = \\gamma_p mc^2 = 2mc^2$.\n    *   Using the energy-momentum relation again:\n    *   $(p_p c)^2 = E_p^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (2mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = 4(mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = 3(mc^2)^2$.\n    *   The momentum magnitude is $p_p c = \\sqrt{3} mc^2$, so $p_p = \\sqrt{3} mc$.\n    *   Since it moves in the negative x-direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} mc, 0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   The total energy before the collision is the sum of the individual energies:\n        $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4mc^2 + 2mc^2 = 6mc^2$.\n    *   The total momentum before the collision is the vector sum of the individual momenta:\n        $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = (\\sqrt{15} mc - \\sqrt{3} mc, 0, 0) = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) mc, 0, 0)$.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State\n\nThe electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons.\n\n*   **Photons:**\n    *   Let the energies of the two photons be $E_{\\gamma1}$ and $E_{\\gamma2}$.\n    *   The problem states their energies are equal: $E_{\\gamma1} = E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$.\n    *   For a photon, the momentum magnitude is related to its energy by $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This implies they move symmetrically with respect to the horizontal x-axis. Let the angle they make with the x-axis be $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$, respectively.\n    *   Photon 1 momentum: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta, 0)$.\n    *   Photon 2 momentum: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma2} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, -p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta, 0)$.\n\n*   **Total Final System:**\n    *   The total energy after the annihilation is: $E_{final} = E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2} = 2E_\\gamma$.\n    *   The total momentum is: $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma2} = (2p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, 0, 0)$.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\nWe apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $6mc^2 = 2E_\\gamma \\implies E_\\gamma = 3mc^2$.\n    *   This gives us the energy of each photon. Now we can find the magnitude of each photon's momentum:\n        $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c = (3mc^2) / c = 3mc$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{final}$.\n    *   The y and z components are zero on both sides, which is consistent with our setup. We only need to equate the x-components.\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) mc = 2p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Now substitute the value of $p_\\gamma = 3mc$:\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) mc = 2(3mc) \\cos\\theta$.\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) mc = 6mc \\cos\\theta$.\n    *   We can cancel out the common factor of $mc$:\n    *   $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Angle\n\nNow we calculate the numerical value of $\\theta$.\n\n*   Using a calculator:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.8730$\n    *   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.7321$\n    *   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.8730 - 1.7321}{6} = \\frac{2.1409}{6} \\approx 0.3568$.\n    *   $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$.\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. One photon's direction makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal, and the other makes an angle $-\\theta$. The total angle between them is $\\alpha = \\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n\n*   $\\alpha = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 138\nB) 172\nC) 74\nD) 96\n\nThe calculated value of 138.2Â° is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
