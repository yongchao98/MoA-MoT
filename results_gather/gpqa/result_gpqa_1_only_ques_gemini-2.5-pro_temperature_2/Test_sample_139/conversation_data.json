    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Gas W:** The gas W is released from a reaction, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple gaseous molecules:\n    *   H₂ (¹H-¹H): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n    *   **D₂ (²H-²H): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Correct, p=n)**\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N-¹⁴N): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Correct, p=n)\n    *   O₂ (¹⁶O-¹⁶O): 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Correct, p=n)\n    *   CD₄ (¹²C(²H)₄): 6+4(1)=10 protons, 6+4(1)=10 neutrons. (Correct, p=n)\n    *   ND₃ (¹⁴N(²H)₃): 7+3(1)=10 protons, 7+3(1)=10 neutrons. (Correct, p=n)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W and a precipitate G\". The fact that heating G releases B, and B's melting point is ~277 K, is a critical clue.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (~277 K).\n    *   This strongly suggests **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   Substance B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This is characteristic of the dehydration of a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, Al(OH)₃ heated gives Al₂O₃ and H₂O. So, G is likely a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₙ.\n    *   G (M(OD)ₙ) is formed from the reaction of X with liquid Y. For the product to be a deuteroxide, the liquid reactant **Y must be D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O (Y) → W + M(OD)ₙ (G).\n    *   To release a gas from D₂O, X must be a very reactive substance, like an active metal, a metal hydride, or a complex metal hydride.\n    *   If the gas W has p=n, and the reactants are X and D₂O, the most plausible gas is **D₂**. For other gases like ND₃ or CD₄ to form, X would need to contain N or C, which complicates the rest of the puzzle unnecessarily (e.g., a nitride reacting with D₂O gives ND₃, but the keto acid clue doesn't fit). So, let's proceed with **W = D₂**.\n    *   The reaction becomes: X + D₂O → D₂ + M(OD)ₙ.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   **\"Its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This suggests a common reagent pair like LiH/LiD, NaBH₄/NaBD₄, or LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄.\n    *   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"** A keto acid has the structure R-CO-R'-COOH, which contains at least 3 oxygen atoms. A reagent that reduces this to a product with 2 oxygens must reduce both the ketone group (-CO-) to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH-) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which has exactly 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   The only common laboratory reagent powerful enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, and Substance X itself must be its deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, which fits the clue \"known for incorporating a heavier isotope (D) of one of its constituent elements (H)\".\n\n4.  **Verify All Clues with X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) reacts violently with D₂O (Y). The products would be LiOD (soluble), Al(OD)₃ (precipitate, G), and D₂ (gas, W).\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). Check.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ is a precipitate. Check.\n    *   **Heating G:** When Al(OD)₃ is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The released substance B is D₂O. Check.\n    *   **Melting Point of B:** D₂O melts at ~277 K. Check.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlD₄ reduces a keto acid to a diol, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. Check.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**. The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present in X.\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number): Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number): Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The question specifies to sum the masses of **all** instances of these elements: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\".\n    *   In the formula LiAlD₄, there is:\n        *   **One atom** of the heaviest element, Aluminum (Al). We use the mass number of its most common isotope, ²⁷Al, which is **27**.\n        *   **Four atoms** of the lightest element, Hydrogen, as Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium (²H) is **2**.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of all Al atoms) + (Mass of all D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
