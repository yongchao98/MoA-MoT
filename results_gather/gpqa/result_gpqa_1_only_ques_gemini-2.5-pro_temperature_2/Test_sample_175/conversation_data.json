    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   The initial state of the system (un-normalized) is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    ```\n    P = [ 0,    1/√2,   0   ]\n        [ 1/√2,   0,   1/√2 ]\n        [ 0,    1/√2,   0   ]\n    ```\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    ```\n    Q = [ 1, 0,  0 ]\n        [ 0, 0,  0 ]\n        [ 0, 0, -1 ]\n    ```\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the initial state vector `|ψ⟩`. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization factor is `1/√6`. So, the normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n**3. Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n\nTo find the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable, we need to project the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector of the operator.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of P for the eigenvalue 0.**\n    The possible measurement outcomes for P are its eigenvalues. We are interested in the outcome `p = 0`. Let's find the eigenvector `|p₀⟩` corresponding to this eigenvalue:\n    `P|p₀⟩ = 0 * |p₀⟩`\n    ```\n    [ 0,    1/√2,   0   ] [x]   [0]\n    [ 1/√2,   0,   1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n    [ 0,    1/√2,   0   ] [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    From the first and third rows, we get `(1/√2)y = 0`, which means `y = 0`.\n    From the second row, we get `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which simplifies to `x + z = 0` or `x = -z`.\n    If we choose `z = 1`, then `x = -1`. The un-normalized eigenvector is `[-1, 0, 1]^T`.\n    Normalizing this eigenvector: `√((-1)² + 0² + 1²) = √2`.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for `p = 0` is:\n    `|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0.**\n    The probability is the square of the magnitude of the projection of `|ψ_norm⟩` onto `|p₀⟩`:\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    `⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1] ) . ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√12) * [(-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1)]`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1) = 2/√12 = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**4. State Collapse and Probability of Measuring Q = -1**\n\nAfter measuring P and getting the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p₀⟩`. So, the new state of the system is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]^T`\n\nNow we measure Q on this new state `|ψ'⟩`. We want to find the probability of getting `q = -1`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue -1.**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `q = -1` is:\n    `|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1.**\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = ( [0, 0, 1] ) . ( (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√2) * [(0)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1)]`\n    `= (1/√2) * 1 = 1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = (1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**5. Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in each step:\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<D>>>"
