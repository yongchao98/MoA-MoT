    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $A$ is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$ for a sphere of radius R).\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 is:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information on Radii:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    Now we need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1/T_2$.\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Peak Wavelength (Wien's Displacement Law):** For a black body, the temperature is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max, emit}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{max, emit}$\n    where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant. This means the temperature is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength.\n    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} / \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$) are the same, not the emitted ones. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.\n    The relativistic Doppler effect formula relates the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$\n    where $v$ is the radial velocity (positive if moving away) and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Apply Doppler Effect to Each Star:**\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$. So, the observed peak wavelength is the same as the emitted peak wavelength:\n      $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. The observed peak wavelength is:\n      $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n\n8.  **Use the Condition of Equal Observed Wavelengths:** We are given $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$. Therefore:\n    $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}$\n    Rearranging this gives us the ratio of the *emitted* peak wavelengths:\n    $\\lambda_{max, emit, 2} / \\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio:** From step 5, we know $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} / \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$. So:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the equation from step 4:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}} \\right)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times \\left( \\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c} \\right)^2$\n\n11. **Plug in the Numerical Values:**\n    *   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $v_2/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) \\approx 0.002333$\n\n    Now, let's compute the ratio:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times \\left( \\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333} \\right)^2$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times \\left( \\frac{0.997667}{1.002333} \\right)^2$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times (0.995345)^2$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times 0.99071$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.2291$\n\n12. **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
