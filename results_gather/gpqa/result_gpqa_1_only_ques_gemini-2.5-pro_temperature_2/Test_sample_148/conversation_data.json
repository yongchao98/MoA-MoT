    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the observations to arrive at the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   The observation of two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace indicates the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be separated based on their different interactions with the stationary phase of the LC column.\n    *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both peaks have the *exact same mass*, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. This is a critical piece of information. It rules out impurities that have a different chemical formula, such as precursors (which would be smaller) or products of side-reactions like 'double coupling' (which would be larger).\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that we have a mixture of two isomers—molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   The NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   The fact that these two peaks have roughly equal integrals (summing to the expected 1H) indicates that the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   This corroborates the LC-MS finding of two isomers present in equal amounts.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would have a different (lower) mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is incorrect. A double-coupled product would have a different (higher) mass, contradicting the MS data.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard LC (which typically uses an achiral column) and are indistinguishable by standard NMR (in an achiral solvent). You would see only one peak in the LC and only one set of signals in the NMR. This option is inconsistent with the observations.\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point, solubility) and thus have different interactions with an LC column, allowing them to be separated. They also have different chemical environments for their atoms, leading to distinct signals in an NMR spectrum. A common source of diastereomers in peptide synthesis is racemization at a single chiral center (epimerization) or cis-trans isomerism about a peptide bond (particularly an X-Pro bond), which is a form of atropisomerism. Both scenarios would produce two compounds with the same mass but different structures that are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence—two separable species of the same mass that show distinct NMR signals—is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
