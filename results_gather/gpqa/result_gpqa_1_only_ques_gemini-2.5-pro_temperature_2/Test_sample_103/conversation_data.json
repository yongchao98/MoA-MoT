    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n    The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star \"wobbles\" back and forth along our line of sight. This motion causes a shift in the wavelength (`Δλ`) of its spectral lines. The amplitude of this wavelength shift is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (`K`).\n\n    *   `Δλ ∝ K`\n\n    Therefore, we can find the ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes for the two systems:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Relating Stellar Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n    The radial velocity amplitude `K` for a star in a circular orbit is given by the formula (assuming the system is viewed edge-on, `sin(i)=1`, which is a standard simplification in such problems unless stated otherwise):\n\n    `K = v_s = (2π / T) * a_s`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `v_s` is the orbital speed of the star.\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n    *   `a_s` is the radius of the star's orbit around the center of mass.\n\n    From the definition of the center of mass (`M_s * a_s = m_p * a_p`, where `a_p` is the planet's orbital radius) and knowing that the planet's orbit is much larger than the star's (`a_p ≈ a`, where `a` is the star-planet separation), we have:\n    `a_s ≈ a * (m_p / M_s)`\n\n    Substituting this into the equation for `K`:\n    `K ≈ (2π / T) * a * (m_p / M_s)`\n\n3.  **Using Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period `T` to the semi-major axis (or radius for a circular orbit) `a`. For a planet orbiting a much more massive star:\n\n    `T² = (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a³`\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    `a = (G * M_s * T² / (4π²))^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations**\n    Now we substitute the expression for `a` back into our equation for `K`:\n\n    `K ≈ (2π / T) * (G * M_s * T² / (4π²))^(1/3) * (m_p / M_s)`\n\n    Let's focus on the proportionality with `T`, as all other variables (`m_p`, `M_s`, `G`, `π`) are either constants or are the same for both systems.\n\n    `K ∝ (1/T) * (T²)^(1/3)`\n    `K ∝ T⁻¹ * T^(2/3)`\n    `K ∝ T⁻¹ᐟ³`\n\n    This crucial relationship shows that the stellar velocity amplitude `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period `T`. Intuitively, a planet in a tighter, shorter-period orbit will move faster and pull its star around more quickly, resulting in a larger `K`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of the Periods**\n    We can now set up a ratio for our two systems:\n\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3)`\n\n    We can also write this as:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    Now, we plug in the value for `K₂ / K₁` and solve for the desired ratio `T₂ / T₁`:\n\n    `1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    Cube both sides:\n    `(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂`\n    `2.744 = T₁ / T₂`\n\n    To find `T₂ / T₁`, we take the reciprocal:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744`\n\n    Alternatively, using fractions from the start is cleaner:\n    `T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3 = (5 / 7)³`\n    `T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
