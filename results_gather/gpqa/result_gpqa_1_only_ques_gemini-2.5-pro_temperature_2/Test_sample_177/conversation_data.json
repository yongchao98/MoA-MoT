    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and then use this information to decide whether the theory described by the interaction Lagrangian is renormalizable. We will work in natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$. In this system, mass, energy, and momentum all have dimensions of mass (M), and length and time have dimensions of inverse mass (M$^{-1}$).\n\n### Step 1: Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density\n\nThe action, $S$, is a dimensionless quantity. It is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$\n\nSince the action $S$ is dimensionless, its mass dimension is zero: $[S] = M^0$.\nThe four-volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of (length)$^4$. Since length has dimension M$^{-1}$, we have:\n$[d^4x] = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$\n\nFor the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension that cancels out the dimension of $d^4x$:\n$[S] = [d^4x][\\mathcal{L}] \\implies M^0 = M^{-4}[\\mathcal{L}]$\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$\n\n### Step 2: Mass Dimensions of the Fields\n\nWe determine the mass dimensions of the fields from their standard kinetic terms.\n\n**Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin,\\psi} = i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$. This term must have the same dimension as $\\mathcal{L}$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{kin,\\psi}] = [\\bar{\\psi}][\\gamma^\\mu][\\partial_\\mu][\\psi] = M^4$\n- The partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has dimension of momentum, so $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n- The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices, so $[\\gamma^\\mu] = M^0$.\n- The dimensions of $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ are the same, so $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$.\n\nSubstituting these into the dimensional equation:\n$[\\psi]^2 \\cdot M^0 \\cdot M^1 = M^4$\n$[\\psi]^2 = M^3$\n$[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$\n\n**Gauge field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the gauge field (e.g., electromagnetic field) is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin,A} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This term must also have dimension $M^4$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{kin,A}] = [F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$\nTaking the square root, we find the dimension of the field strength tensor:\n$[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$\n\n### Step 3: Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$\n\nNow we use the given interaction Lagrangian to find the mass dimension of $\\kappa$:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe dimension of this interaction term must also be $M^4$:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$\n\nWe need the dimension of $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n$[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$\n\nNow, substitute the known dimensions into the equation:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M^{3/2}] \\cdot [M^0] \\cdot [M^{3/2}] \\cdot [M^2] = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### Step 4: Renormalizability\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimensions of its coupling constants. The rule of thumb from power counting is as follows:\n- If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the interaction is \"super-renormalizable\".\n- If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension, the interaction is \"renormalizable\".\n- If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the interaction is \"non-renormalizable\".\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable. A negative mass dimension implies that at higher orders in perturbation theory, loop diagrams will have divergences that are increasingly severe, requiring the introduction of an infinite number of new counterterms to absorb them. This spoils the predictive power of the theory at high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n- Because the mass dimension of the coupling constant is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
