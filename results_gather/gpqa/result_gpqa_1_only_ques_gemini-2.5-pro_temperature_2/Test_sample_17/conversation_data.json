    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n**1. Understand the notation**\nThe bracket notation `[A/B]` for elemental abundances is defined as:\n`[A/B] = log10( (nA/nB)_star ) - log10( (nA/nB)_sun )`\nwhere `nA` and `nB` are the number densities of elements A and B. A key identity derived from this definition is:\n`[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\nThis allows us to relate different abundance ratios for the same star.\n\n**2. Calculate the silicon abundance for Star_1**\nWe are given for Star_1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nUsing the identity `[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`, we can find `[Si/H]_1`:\n`0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`\n\nBy definition, `[Si/H]_1` relates the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 to that in the Sun:\n`[Si/H]_1 = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n`0.3 = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\nSo, `log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`.\n\n**3. Calculate the silicon abundance for Star_2**\nWe are given for Star_2:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nUsing the identity `[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`, we can find `[Si/H]_2`:\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\nBy definition, `[Si/H]_2` relates the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 to that in the Sun:\n`[Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n`-0.3 = log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\nSo, `log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`.\n\n**4. Calculate the ratio of silicon abundances**\nThe question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms,\" which in this context means the ratio of the silicon abundance fractions `(nSi/nH)` in the two stars.\nLet the ratio `R = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\nTo find this ratio, we can take the logarithm:\n`log10(R) = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 )`\n`log10(R) = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_2 )`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions we found in steps 2 and 3:\n`log10(R) = (0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )) - (-0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ))`\n`log10(R) = 0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ) + 0.3 - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n`log10(R) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the ratio `R`, we take the antilog:\n`R = 10^0.6`\n\n`R â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nNote that the masses of the stars and the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg were extra information not needed for the final calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~1.2\nB) ~12.6\nC) ~3.9\nD) ~0.8\n\nOur calculated ratio of ~3.98 is best matched by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
