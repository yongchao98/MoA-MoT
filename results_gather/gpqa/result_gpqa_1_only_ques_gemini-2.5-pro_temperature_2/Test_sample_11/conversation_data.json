    "This is a problem of relativistic two-body decay. We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Decay: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n*   The initial Pi(+) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of Pi(+) (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of mu(+) (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered to be massless (m_νc² = 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Energy Before (E_before):** Since the Pi(+) is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    E_before = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **Energy After (E_after):** The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the products (muon and neutrino). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE).\n    E_after = E_μ + E_ν\n    E_after = (m_μc² + KE_μ) + (m_νc² + KE_ν)\n    Since m_νc² = 0, E_after = (m_μc² + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n\n*   **Equating Energies:**\n    m_πc² = m_μc² + KE_μ + KE_ν\n    139.6 MeV = 105.7 MeV + KE_μ + KE_ν\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV  ----(Equation 1)\n    This is the total kinetic energy released in the decay (Q-value).\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Momentum Before (p_before):** Since the Pi(+) is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    p_before = 0\n\n*   **Momentum After (p_after):** The two product particles must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Therefore, the magnitude of their momenta must be equal.\n    |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Using the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe relation is: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    E_ν² = (p_νc)² + (m_νc²)²\n    E_ν² = (pc)² + 0\n    E_ν = pc\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n\n*   **For the muon:**\n    We can solve for the energy of one of the particles directly. The total energy of the neutrino (E_ν) is given by:\n    E_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / (2 * m_πc²)\n    E_ν = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / (2 * 139.6)\n    E_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    E_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\n    E_ν = 29.784 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    So, KE_ν = 29.8 MeV.\n\n**4. Find the Kinetic Energy of the Muon**\nUsing Equation 1 from the energy conservation step:\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\nKE_μ = 4.1 MeV\n\nSlight rounding differences occur, a more precise calculation:\nKE_μ = 33.9 - 29.784 = 4.116 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of mu(+) (KE_μ) = **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of nu (KE_ν) = **29.8 MeV**\n\nThese values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
