    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Induction:**\n    *   A positive point charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of the conductor.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, this charge $+q$ will induce an equal and opposite charge on the nearest conducting surface. Thus, a total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. To see this, consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. The electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. Therefore, the net flux through this Gaussian surface is zero, which implies that the total charge enclosed must be zero. Since there is a charge $+q$ inside the cavity, there must be a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on its inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on its outer surface.\n\n2.  **Understand Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electrostatic fields produced by charges inside the shell. The charge distribution on the inner surface $(-q)$ arranges itself in such a way as to perfectly cancel the field of the point charge $(+q)$ for all points outside the cavity.\n    *   This means that for any point P outside the main conductor, the net electric field due to the original charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Field from the Outer Surface:**\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is due *only* to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   We established that the charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$. Due to the shielding effect, the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity. In the absence of any other external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   According to the shell theorem (which is a consequence of Gauss's law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a point charge of the same magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In this case, we have a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly on the outer sphere of radius $R$, whose center is at O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total charge on outer surface}}{(\\text{distance from center O})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), the position of its center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. The conductor effectively shields the outside world from the details within the cavity, and the external field is determined solely by the total charge induced on the outer surface and the geometry of that surface.\n\nThe correct answer is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
