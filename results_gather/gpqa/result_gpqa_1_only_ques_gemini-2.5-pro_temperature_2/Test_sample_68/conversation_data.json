    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle $X^0$ that decays after traveling a certain distance in a bubble chamber. The key physical principles are:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation.\n*   **Radioactive Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability distribution.\n\nAn individual decay can be observed only if the particle $X^0$ travels a distance, $L$, that is greater than the spatial resolution of the detector, let's call it $d$. The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. This means we need to find the value of $d$ such that the probability of the path length $L$ being greater than or equal to $d$ is at least 0.30.\n\n### 2. Calculating Relativistic Quantities\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($mc^2$).\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Rest mass $m_0c^2 = 3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}$\n\nThe Lorentz factor is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\, \\text{GeV}}{3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Mean Decay Length\nThe mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is dilated by the factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\nThe particle travels at a speed $v$ very close to the speed of light $c$. The mean distance traveled before decay, known as the mean decay length $\\lambda$, is given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$.\n\nA convenient formula for the mean decay length that combines these steps is:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\nwhere $p$ is the particle's momentum. The momentum can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n\nNow we can calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\, \\text{GeV}}{3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\times c \\tau_0$\n$\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n### 4. Applying the Observation Condition\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance $L$ or more before decaying follows an exponential distribution:\n$P(L' \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n\nWe want to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the required resolution, $d$, must be such that the probability of the path length $L$ being greater than or equal to $d$ is at least 0.30:\n$P(L \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the boundary condition for the resolution, we set the probability to 0.30:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for $d$:\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n$d \\approx \\lambda \\times 1.204$\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ we calculated:\n$d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\times 1.204$\n$d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\nA) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nThe value we calculated ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$) is very close to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$). The slight numerical difference (around 9%) is likely due to a minor inaccuracy in the values provided in the problem statement. However, the other options are off by several orders of magnitude, making D the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
