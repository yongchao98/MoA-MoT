    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3 and 4 to identify B, D, F, G, and H.**\n    *   **Clue 3:** C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). The regeneration of A indicates that A is a central component (like an element or stable oxide) and the ligands attached to it hydrolyze. For a single species B to hydrolyze into a strong and a weak acid, it must be a mixed compound. A prime candidate is Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), which reacts with water in a disproportionation reaction: `2NO₂ + H₂O -> HNO₃ (strong acid, F) + HNO₂ (weak acid, G)`. This fits the description perfectly. Another possibility would be an interhalogen like ClF (`ClF + H₂O -> HCl (strong) + HOF (weak)`) or nitrosyl chloride NOCl (`NOCl + H₂O -> HCl (strong) + HNO₂(weak)`).\n    *   **Clue 4:** D (gas) reacts with B (gas) in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n        *   If we test B = NO₂, a very common 1:1 reaction with another simple gas is with Nitric Oxide (NO): `NO₂(g) + NO(g) <=> N₂O₃(l)`. Dinitrogen trioxide (N₂O₃) is a deep blue liquid and can be used as a non-aqueous solvent. So, it's very likely that **B = NO₂**, **D = NO**, and **H = N₂O₃**.\n        *   If we test other candidates for B, it's harder to find a simple 1:1 reaction. For example, if B = ClF, a possible D would be F₂, reacting to form ClF₃ (`ClF + F₂ -> ClF₃`). While ClF₃ is a liquid, it's an extremely aggressive fluorinating agent, not typically just called a \"solvent\". The NOx pathway appears most coherent.\n\n2.  **Confirm the identities of the acids.**\n    *   With B identified as NO₂, the hydrolysis products are indeed **F = HNO₃** (Nitric acid, strong) and **G = HNO₂** (Nitrous acid, weak).\n\n3.  **Summarize the knowns and unknowns.**\n    *   **A**: An unknown solid.\n    *   **B**: NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **C**: A bright red product from the reaction `A(s) + 8NO₂(g) -> C`.\n    *   **D**: NO (Nitric oxide)\n    *   **E**: An extremely hazardous product from the reaction `C + 2NO(g) -> E`.\n    *   **F**: HNO₃\n    *   **G**: HNO₂\n    *   **H**: N₂O₃\n\n4.  **Analyze the formation of E and determine its identity and symmetry.**\n    *   The crucial reaction is **`C + 2D -> E`**, which translates to **`C + 2NO -> E`**.\n    *   We don't know the identity of the red solid C. However, we are asked for the molecular symmetry of E, suggesting that E is a specific, well-defined molecule.\n    *   The clue \"extremely hazardous\" is critical. Many simple nitrogen oxides are hazardous.\n    *   Let's consider possible products (E) from a reaction involving NO. NO can dimerize to N₂O₂, which exists as a planar *cis* isomer (`C₂ᵥ` symmetry) and a planar *trans* isomer (`C₂ₕ` symmetry). The *cis* isomer is generally the more stable form in the solid and liquid phase. `cis`-N₂O₂ is planar with a bent N-N-O angle. It has a C₂ rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes (one in the molecular plane, one bisecting the N-N bond). Therefore, its point group is **`C₂ᵥ`**.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **E = N₂O₂ (cis-dimer)**. The reaction would be `C + 2NO -> N₂O₂ + ...`. This suggests that C acts as a catalyst or is a reagent that is consumed. While we cannot determine the exact identity of A and C from the information given (the `A+8NO₂->C` reaction is highly unusual and may be fictitious or very obscure), the subsequent reaction `C + 2NO -> E` leading to the formation of a known hazardous substance is a plausible puzzle construct. Among simple molecules formed from NO, `cis-N₂O₂` has `C₂ᵥ` symmetry, which is one of the options.\n\n5.  **Evaluate other possible point groups for E.**\n    *   A) C₂: Possible for molecules like H₂O₂. Less common for small inorganic molecules.\n    *   B) D₄h: For square planar molecules like XeF₄. We found no consistent pathway to such a molecule.\n    *   C) D∞h: For linear molecules with an inversion center like CO₂ or I₃⁻. We found no consistent pathway here either.\n    *   D) C₂ᵥ: This point group includes many common bent or T-shaped molecules (H₂O, SO₂, O₃, ClF₃, cis-N₂O₂). The logical pathway derived points strongly towards NOx chemistry, making cis-N₂O₂ (`C₂ᵥ`) a strong candidate for the product E.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
