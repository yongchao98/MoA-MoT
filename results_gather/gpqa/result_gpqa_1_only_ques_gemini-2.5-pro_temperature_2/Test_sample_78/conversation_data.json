    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the provided NMR spectra of the product to deduce its structure. The product will have the same molecular formula as the starting material, Compound X, which is C11H12O, since the reaction is likely a rearrangement.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone, as there is no aldehyde proton in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two different methyl (CH₃) groups.\n    *   The remaining six signals are in the aromatic/alkene region (δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm).\n    *   The total number of carbons is 1+1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 11, which matches the molecular formula C11H12O. The presence of two signals corresponding to 2 carbons each (126.9 and 129.1 ppm) indicates some symmetry.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two separate singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These are two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, in the alkene region. They are coupled to each other, which points to a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   The total number of protons is 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 12, matching the formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   We have a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   We have a -CH=CH- group.\n    *   We have two methyl groups.\n    *   Let's put the pieces together. The most logical structure that accommodates all these fragments is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as 4'-methylchalcone analog or p-methylbenzalacetone).\n\n    Structure of the Product (P):\n    ```\n        CH₃\n         |\n        / \\\n       | o |---CH=CH---C(=O)---CH₃\n        \\ /\n         |\n    ```\n    This structure is consistent with all the NMR data:\n    *   Two non-equivalent methyl groups: one attached to the ketone (acetyl methyl) and one on the aromatic ring (tolyl methyl).\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted (p-tolyl) ring, which would give the characteristic AA'BB' pattern appearing as two doublets.\n    *   A trans-disubstituted alkene (-CH=CH-) where the two protons are in different environments and couple to each other, giving two doublets.\n    *   A ketone carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X**\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C11H12O) with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) in a nonpolar solvent. This is a rearrangement reaction. We need to find which of the given options for Compound X could plausibly rearrange to form the product we identified. The options are all epoxides (oxiranes). The transformation is an epoxide rearrangement.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide (C₁₀H₁₀O):** The molecular formula is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O):** This molecule's skeleton is `[Ph-CH=C(Me)]-C-C`. Our product's skeleton is `Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C-C`. This would require a major skeletal rearrangement, including migration of a methyl group from the chain onto the phenyl ring. This is highly unlikely under these reaction conditions.\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O):** The skeleton is `Ph-CH=CH-C(O)C-C`. The product is `Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C-C`. Similar to B, this requires a methyl group migration to the phenyl ring, which is an improbable transformation.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O):**\n    *   The structure is `p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   The carbon skeleton is `Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C-C`.\n    *   The product P is `p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   The carbon skeleton of this starting material is identical to the skeleton of the product. The transformation from D to P is an isomerization of the terminal `...-CH(O)CH₂` (epoxide) group to a `...-C(=O)CH₃` (methyl ketone) group. This is a well-known type of reaction called an epoxide-ketone rearrangement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most plausible reaction is the isomerization of **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** to **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. This reaction conserves the carbon skeleton and involves a known type of functional group transformation. The other options would require complex and energetically unfavorable rearrangements. Therefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
