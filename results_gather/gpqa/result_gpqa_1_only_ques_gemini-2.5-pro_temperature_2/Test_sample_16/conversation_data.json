    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical Reaction:** The problem involves the equilibrium between the calcium-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) and its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and the fully deprotonated form of EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The formation reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Define the Formation Constant ($K_f$):** The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction is given as $K_{f}$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$).\n    $K_{f} = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Consider the Dissociation:** We start with a solution of the complex, which will dissociate slightly back into its ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$   | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Apply the Equilibrium Expression:** Now we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_{f} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and Solve:** Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and the dissociation ('x') will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Finally, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions ($[Ca^{2+}]$) at equilibrium is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
