    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at **m/z = 158**, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion. Its relative intensity is 32% of the M+ peak (100%). This **M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1** is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine (Cl) atom**. (Natural abundance of chlorine is ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n\n*Conclusion from MS*: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is the hallmark of the **O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the characteristic region for a **C=O (carbonyl) stretch**. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*Conclusion from IR*: The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is in the highly deshielded region (far downfield). A chemical shift between 10-13 ppm is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. Its integration of 1H confirms this. It is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of **two doublets** with a **2H:2H integration ratio** is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring must be different, leading to two distinct sets of protons.\n    *   The protons at 8.02 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) because they are adjacent (ortho) to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.72 ppm are adjacent to the chlorine atom.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**\n\nCombining all the evidence:\n*   The compound is a **carboxylic acid** (from IR and ¹H NMR).\n*   It contains **one chlorine atom** (from MS).\n*   It has a **para-substituted benzene ring** (from ¹H NMR).\n*   The molecular weight is **156 g/mol** (from MS).\n\nLet's check the proposed structure, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, against this evidence.\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 1 and a -Cl atom at position 4.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7×12) + (5×1) + (35.5) + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This matches the mass spectrum.\n*   **Spectra:** As a para-substituted chlorinated carboxylic acid, it would produce exactly the MS, IR, and NMR signals observed.\n\nTherefore, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
