    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory.\n\n### Step 1: Define \"Detectable\"\n\nThe problem provides a clear definition of detectability:\n*   **Telescope:** A single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT). This is known as the 1-UT mode for ESPRESSO.\n*   **Instrument:** ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n*   **Condition:** Achieving a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) of at least 10.\n*   **Exposure Time:** 1 hour (3600 seconds).\n\nThe provided ESO link for ESPRESSO states its performance goal: \"The goal is to reach a S/N of 10 at magnitude V~20 in a one-hour exposure in the 1-UT mode.\"\nThis gives us a limiting apparent magnitude. Any star with an apparent V magnitude (Vmag) of 20 or brighter (i.e., Vmag ≤ 20) will be detectable.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Observability from Paranal\n\nFor a star to be observed, it must rise above the horizon at the telescope's location.\n*   **Location:** Paranal Observatory, Chile.\n*   **Latitude:** Approximately 24.6° South.\n\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC). Stars with a very high northern declination will never rise above the horizon at a southern hemisphere observatory. The approximate declination limit for an object to be visible from Paranal is below +65°. Any object with a declination close to the North Celestial Pole (+90°) is unobservable.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against the two criteria: 1) Is it observable from Paranal? 2) Is its apparent magnitude Vmag ≤ 20?\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (Vmag):** Vmag ≈ -0.74. This is extremely bright. Since -0.74 ≤ 20, it easily meets the brightness criterion.\n*   **Observability (DEC):** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41'. This is in the southern celestial sky and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (Vmag):** Vmag ≈ +1.98. This is very bright. Since +1.98 ≤ 20, it would meet the brightness criterion if it were visible.\n*   **Observability (DEC):** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of approximately +89° 15'. From Paranal's latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is permanently below the northern horizon and is impossible to observe.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not Detectable.\n\n**c) Star with M=15 mag at d=10 pc**\nTo find the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d), we use the distance modulus formula:\n`m - M = 5 * log₁₀(d/10 pc)` or `m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5`\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (Vmag):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5`\n    `m = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15`\n    The apparent magnitude is 15. Since 15 ≤ 20, it meets the brightness criterion.\n*   **Observability (DEC):** The star is at DEC = 0°, on the celestial equator. It is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**d) Star with M=15 mag at d=200 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (Vmag):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200) - 5`\n    `log₁₀(200) ≈ 2.30`\n    `m ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.30) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`\n    The apparent magnitude is ~21.5. Since 21.5 > 20, it is too faint to be detected under the specified conditions.\n*   **Observability (DEC):** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not Detectable.\n\n**e) Star with M=15 mag at d=5 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (Vmag):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5`\n    `log₁₀(5) ≈ 0.70`\n    `m ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.70) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`\n    The apparent magnitude is ~13.5. Since 13.5 ≤ 20, it meets the brightness criterion.\n*   **Observability (DEC):** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**f) Star with M=15 mag at d=50 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (Vmag):**\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50) - 5`\n    `log₁₀(50) ≈ 1.70`\n    `m ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.70) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`\n    The apparent magnitude is ~18.5. Since 18.5 ≤ 20, it meets the brightness criterion.\n*   **Observability (DEC):** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Detectable Stars\n\nLet's summarize our findings:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable** (not visible)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable** (too faint)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Detectable**\n\nThe stars that are detectable are (a), (c), (e), and (f). In total, there are **4** detectable stars.\n\n<<<D>>>"
