    "This problem requires us to calculate the relative concentration of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II), in a solution containing various cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. We can determine the percentage of each species by using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand (SCN⁻).\n\n**1. Understand the Species and Equilibria**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species in the solution:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe formation of each complex from the free Co²⁺ ion is described by its overall stability constant (βₙ):\n- Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺         ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n- Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]      ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n- Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻    ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n- Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]. The percentage is given by:\n% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100%\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration and the ligand concentration [SCN⁻]:\n- [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n- [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n- [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n- [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + ... + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe problem states that the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10⁻² M (0.01 M) and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. Since the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] to be equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M. The descriptor \"blue\" is a chemical property, but the chemical name \"dithiocyanato cobalt(II)\" unambiguously refers to the [Co(SCN)₂] species.\n\nGiven values:\n- [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n- β₁ = 9\n- β₂ = 40\n- β₃ = 63\n- β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the terms in the denominator (let's call the sum `S`):\n- Term 0 (for Co²⁺): 1\n- Term 1 (β₁[SCN⁻]): 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n- Term 2 (β₂[SCN⁻]²): 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n- Term 3 (β₃[SCN⁻]³): 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n- Term 4 (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴): 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the sum `S`:\nS = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator of our fraction is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex, which is Term 2.\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nCalculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert this fraction to a percentage:\n% [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
