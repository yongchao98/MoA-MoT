    "This problem requires calculating the minimum electrostatic potential energy of a system of 13 charged particles.\n\n**1. System Description**\n\n*   Number of particles: 13\n*   Charge of each particle: `q = 2e`, where `e = 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C` is the elementary charge. So, `q = 2 * 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C = 3.204354 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`.\n*   Central charge: One particle (`q_P`) is fixed at a point P.\n*   Shell charges: The other 12 particles (`q_i`, i=1 to 12) are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n*   Goal: Find the minimum energy of this configuration. The minimum energy state will occur when the 12 charges on the sphere arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion.\n\n**2. Electrostatic Potential Energy**\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. We can split this into two parts:\n1.  `U_center`: The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `U_sphere`: The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n`U_total = U_center + U_sphere`\n\n**3. Calculating `U_center`**\n\nThe central charge `q_P` is at a distance `R = 2 m` from each of the 12 shell charges. The potential energy between the central charge and one shell charge is `k * q^2 / R`, where `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²` is Coulomb's constant.\n\nSince there are 12 such interactions, the total energy is:\n`U_center = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nThis part of the energy is fixed by the given constraints.\n\n**4. Calculating `U_sphere` (Minimum Energy Configuration)**\n\nTo find the minimum energy for the entire system, we need to find the configuration of the 12 charges on the sphere that minimizes their mutual potential energy, `U_sphere`. This is a classic problem known as the Thomson problem. For `N=12` particles, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere is given by:\n`U_sphere = Sum_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ 12} (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij = k * q^2 * Sum_{i<j} (1 / r_ij)`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j` on the sphere.\n\nFor an icosahedron, the distances between vertices fall into three categories:\n*   30 pairs of adjacent vertices (edges) at distance `a`.\n*   30 pairs of next-nearest vertices at distance `b`.\n*   6 pairs of antipodal vertices at distance `2R`.\n\nThe relationship between these distances and the sphere's radius `R` is given by geometric properties of the icosahedron:\n*   Edge length: `a = R * sqrt(2 - 2/sqrt(5)) ≈ 1.05146 * R`\n*   Next-nearest neighbor distance: `b = a * φ`, where `φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618` is the golden ratio.\n*   Antipodal distance: `2R`\n\nThe sum term `Sum_{i<j} (1 / r_ij)` can be written as `(30/a + 30/b + 6/(2R))`.\nWe can write `U_sphere` in a more convenient form:\n`U_sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * L_12`\nwhere `L_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum for a unit sphere (`R=1`).\n`L_12 = R * Sum_{i<j} (1 / r_ij) = R * (30/a + 30/b + 3/R) = 30(R/a) + 30(R/b) + 3`\nUsing the geometric relations: `R/a ≈ 1/1.05146 ≈ 0.95106` and `R/b = R/(a*φ) ≈ 0.58778`.\n`L_12 = 30 * (0.95106) + 30 * (0.58778) + 3 = 28.5318 + 17.6334 + 3 = 49.1652`\nThis value `L_12 ≈ 49.165` is the standard result for the Thomson problem with N=12.\n\n**5. Calculating the Total Minimum Energy**\n\nNow we combine the two energy components:\n`U_total = U_center + U_sphere`\n`U_total = 12 * (k * q^2 / R) + (k * q^2 / R) * L_12`\nFactoring out the common term `(k * q^2 / R)`:\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + L_12)`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + 49.1652) = (k * q^2 / R) * 61.1652`\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nLet's use the standard rounded values for constants that are often used in such problems to match the provided options.\n*   `e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q = 2e = 3.204 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `k = 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n\nFirst, calculate the energy pre-factor:\n`q^2 = (3.204 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)² = 1.0265616 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n`k * q^2 / R = (8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C² * 1.0265616 × 10⁻³⁷ C²) / 2 m`\n`k * q^2 / R = (9.2268 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) / 2 m = 4.6134 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n\nNow, multiply by the dimensionless factor:\n`U_total = (4.6134 × 10⁻²⁸ J) * 61.1652`\n`U_total = 282.196 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n`U_total = 2.82196 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding this value to three decimal places gives `2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
