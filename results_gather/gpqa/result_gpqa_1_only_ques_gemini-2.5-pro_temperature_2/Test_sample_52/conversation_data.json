    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Identify Molecular Fragments:**\n\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two aromatic-H signals:** This suggests a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4). The presence of two signals often indicates a para (1,4) substitution pattern with different substituents, resulting in an AA'BB' system that appears as two distinct signals (often two doublets). This fragment accounts for **C6H4**.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and one -CH3 signal:** This pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)`\n        *   The proton H(b) is coupled to one proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group CH3(c) (giving a quartet). The signal for H(b) would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This matches the data.\n        *   The proton H(a) is coupled only to the proton H(b), so its signal would be a **doublet (d)**. This also matches the data.\n        *   The methyl group CH3(c) is coupled to H(b), so its signal would be a doublet. This accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals mentioned.\n        *   Therefore, we have a propenyl group fragment, which has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **A second -CH3 signal:** There is one more methyl group in the molecule. It could be part of the ester (e.g., -COOCH3) or attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that rules out groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n\n    *   **Absorption peaks indicating an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms (O2)** in the formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n\n    *   We have the following pieces: a benzene ring (C6H4), a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3 which is C3H5), a second methyl group (-CH3), and an ester linkage (-COO-).\n    *   Let's assemble them into a valid structure. A very common and logical arrangement is a methyl ester of a propenyl-substituted benzoic acid.\n    *   Structure: A propenyl group and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) are attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   **(CH3-CH=CH) — C6H4 — (COOCH3)**\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular formula for this structure:\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 1 (from COO) + 1 (from OCH3) = **11 carbons**.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from OCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 (from COO) = **2 oxygens**.\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The proposed structure has a benzene ring (DoU = 4), a carbon-carbon double bond (DoU = 1), and a carbon-oxygen double bond (DoU = 1).\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The formula is consistent with the structure deduced from the spectra.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   A) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7)\n    *   B) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6)\n    *   C) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6)\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5)\n\n    Our deduced formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. Let's briefly check the others. Option D (C11H14O2) has a DoU of 5, which would account for the aromatic ring and the ester's C=O bond, but not the vinyl C=C bond. Therefore, it cannot be correct. Option B (C12H14O2) could be formed, for example, by `ethyl p-propenylbenzoate`, but this contains a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. Our derived structure and formula are the only ones that fit all the given information.\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
