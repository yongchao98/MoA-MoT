    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy of the oscillator is conserved. The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy ($T$) and its potential energy ($U$).\n    $E_{total} = T + U$\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy**\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $T = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U$ stored in the spring is the integral of the force, $U(x) = \\int_0^x -F(x') dx' = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    So, the total conserved energy at any point $x$ with velocity $v$ is:\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Energy at Key Positions**\n    We can find the value of the total energy by analyzing the system at a point where the energies are easy to calculate. This happens at the points of maximum amplitude.\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        The mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n        When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n        The kinetic energy is $T = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        Therefore, the total energy of the system is $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The kinetic energy is at its maximum because the speed is maximum. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n        The kinetic energy is $T_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        At this point, the total energy is $E_{total} = T_{max} + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    This derived expression matches option C.\n\n    Let's check the other options:\n    A) This expression can lead to imaginary or unphysical speeds.\n    B) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ is the classical (non-relativistic) result, obtained by equating $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    D) This option is dimensionally inconsistent, as it subtracts a term with units of velocity squared from the dimensionless number 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the maximum speed is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
