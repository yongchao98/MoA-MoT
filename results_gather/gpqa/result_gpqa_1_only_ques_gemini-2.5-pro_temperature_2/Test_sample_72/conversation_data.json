    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe two astronauts are moving in the same direction. To find the relative speed between them in a relativistic context, we use the velocity subtraction formula from special relativity:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $v_1$ = velocity of the first astronaut = 0.6 c\n*   $v_2$ = velocity of the second astronaut = 0.5 c\n*   c = speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428 c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14 c**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its components. The total energy of a moving object is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_{0}c^2$\n\nwhere $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Rest mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n*   Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6 c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Rest mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n*   Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5 c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe relative speed is approximately **0.14 c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
