    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics**\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels under two different temperature conditions. This is governed by the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms over various energy states in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{(E_2 - E_1)}{kT}} $$\nwhere:\n-   $N_2$ and $N_1$ are the number of atoms in the higher energy level (level 2) and lower energy level (level 1), respectively.\n-   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n-   $E_2 - E_1 = \\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n-   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n-   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Identify the Key Information**\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n-   Temperature of the star without spots (T₁): 6000 K.\n-   Overall effective temperature of the star with spots (T₂): 5500 K.\n-   The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a photon of wavelength (λ): 1448 Å.\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio ($N_2/N_1$) changes. Since the ratio decreases when spots are present (i.e., when the temperature is lower), we are looking for the ratio of the population ratio at high temperature to the population ratio at low temperature.\n\nLet $R(T) = N_2/N_1$ at a given temperature T. We want to calculate the factor $F = R(T_1) / R(T_2)$.\n\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}} $$\n\nThe statistical weights ($g_2/g_1$) cancel out:\n$$ F = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} + \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)} $$\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the formula $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. A useful shortcut for astronomical calculations is $hc \\approx 12400 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{Å}$.\n\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{12400 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{Å}}{1448 \\text{ Å}} \\approx 8.5635 \\text{ eV} $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Term ΔE/k**\n\nWe will use the value of the Boltzmann constant in eV/K, which is $k \\approx 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}$.\n\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} $$\n\n**5. Calculate the Temperature-Dependent Part**\n\nNow we calculate the term in the parenthesis using the given temperatures $T_1 = 6000 \\text{ K}$ and $T_2 = 5500 \\text{ K}$.\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66000} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Factor**\n\nNow, we can compute the exponent and then the final factor.\n\n$$ \\text{Exponent} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) = 99379 \\text{ K} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{66000} \\text{ K}^{-1}\\right) \\approx 1.5057 $$\n\n$$ F = e^{1.5057} \\approx 4.507 $$\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5. The other information in the problem (stellar radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage) helps build a physically consistent scenario but is not directly needed for the calculation, as the relevant effective temperatures are provided.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~4.5\nB) ~2.9\nC) ~7.8\nD) ~1.1\n\nOur calculated factor of ~4.5 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
