    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₓ, where x is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic weight of fluorine is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (x * 19) / (M(Y) + x * 19)\n\n    Rearranging for the molecular weight of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19x = 19x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19x * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45x\n\n    We can test integer values for x, which corresponds to the oxidation state of Y.\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (around Calcium, Argon). Unlikely to form five fluorides with the described reactivity.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (around Bromine, Selenium). Let's check BrF₂: ɷF = (2*19)/(79.9+38) = 0.322, which is not a very good fit.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic weight of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's verify the mass fraction for SbF₃:\n        ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (or 31.88%). This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only ~0.25%. This is a very strong indication that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Verify Antimony's Chemistry.**\n    Antimony is known to form multiple fluorides (e.g., SbF₃, SbF₅, and mixed-valence compounds like Sb₂F₈, Sb₃F₁₃, which are indeed five binary compounds). It also fits the other chemical clues.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound A3.**\n    A3 is obtained by the fluorination of Y (Sb) and can also interact with xenon. The reaction of Sb with excess fluorine yields antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). SbF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent and is one of the few substances known to react with xenon (e.g., Xe + 2SbF₅ → [XeF][Sb₂F₁₁]). Thus, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. Let's calculate the molecular weights of the known antimony fluorides and compare them with the given ranges.\n    *   M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\n    *   M(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol\n    *   The other fluorides are much heavier.\n\n    Now let's check the given ranges:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 160-180\n\n    *   The molecular weight of **SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol)** falls perfectly into range **D) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of **SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol)** does not fall into any of the ranges. It is close to range C, but is outside of it.\n\n    This strongly suggests that A4 is SbF₃.\n\n5.  **Check Consistency of A4 = SbF₃.**\n    Let's check the remaining clues assuming A4 = SbF₃.\n    *   \"A hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\": SbF₃ is a white solid (giving a colorless solution) and is soluble in several solvents, making a concentrated solution plausible.\n    *   \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio... A5 can be obtained\": The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. This is a comproportionation reaction to a lower oxidation state. The product A5 would have the formula `Sb₂F₃`, corresponding to an average oxidation state of +1.5. While unusual, sub-halides of antimony are known, and this fits the requirement of forming another binary compound.\n    *   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\": A subfluoride like `Sb₂F₃` would be unstable in water and would likely disproportionate, for example into elemental antimony (Sb) and an antimony(III) species like Sb₂O₃ (via hydrolysis of SbF₃). This fits the description.\n\nConclusion:\nThe evidence from the mass fraction overwhelmingly points to Y=Sb and A2=SbF₃. When comparing the molecular weights of antimony fluorides with the given ranges, only SbF₃ (MW ≈ 178.8 g/mol) fits perfectly into one of the options (Range D: 160-180). Therefore, A4 must be SbF₃.\n\n<<<D>>>"
