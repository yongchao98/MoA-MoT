    "To solve this problem, we need to find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle of mass *m* moving in the given two-dimensional potential.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²cos²(θ)\n\nThis potential looks complex in polar coordinates, so let's try converting it to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nFirst, identify the terms: r² = x² + y² and r cos(θ) = x.\nSo, r²cos²(θ) = (r cos(θ))² = x².\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential V:\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k(x²)\n\nCombine the terms with x² and y²:\nV(x, y) = [(1/2)k + (3/2)k]x² + (1/2)ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + (1/2)ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)ky²\n\nThis potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning it is a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n\nWhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx² = (1/2)(4k)x²\nV_y(y) = (1/2)ky²\n\nBoth V_x(x) and V_y(y) are the potentials for a simple harmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian of the system is also separable: H = H_x + H_y. Therefore, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = (1/2)k'q² are given by the formula:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\nwhere the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k'/m).\n\nFor the oscillator in the x-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is k_x = 4k.\nThe angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\nThe energy levels are given by:\nE_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\nwhere n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nFor the oscillator in the y-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is k_y = k.\nThe angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k/m).\nThe energy levels are given by:\nE_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nwhere n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\nE = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow we compare this result with the given options:\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur calculated energy spectrum, E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m), matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
