    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how Maxwell's equations would change with the existence of magnetic monopoles.\n\n1.  **Maxwell's Equations in Our Universe:**\n    *   **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** The divergence of the electric field (**E**) is proportional to the electric charge density. This means electric field lines start and end on electric charges.\n    *   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** The divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero (∇ ⋅ **B** = 0). This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles). Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n    *   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** A changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (a curl in **E**).\n    *   **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** An electric current and/or a changing electric field creates a circulating magnetic field (a curl in **B**).\n\n2.  **Introducing Magnetic Monopoles:**\n    An isolated North pole would be a \"source\" of magnetic field lines, and an isolated South pole would be a \"sink,\" just like positive and negative electric charges are for electric fields.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Changes:**\n\n    *   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):** This equation explicitly states that there are no sources or sinks for the magnetic field. If magnetic monopoles existed, this would no longer be true. The divergence of **B** would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. Therefore, this equation **must change**.\n\n    *   **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law describes how electric fields are created. In our universe, they are created by electric charges and changing magnetic fields. With the introduction of magnetic monopoles, there is a new source: a moving magnetic monopole would constitute a \"magnetic current.\" By symmetry, a magnetic current should create a circulating electric field, just as an electric current creates a circulating magnetic field. The original Faraday's law does not account for this, so it **must also change** to include a term for magnetic current.\n\n    *   **The other two equations** would remain unchanged, as they describe how electric charges and currents create fields, which is not affected by the existence of magnetic charges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two equations that would change are:\n1.  The one related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** (Gauss's Law for Magnetism).\n2.  The one related to the **circulation of the electric field** (Faraday's Law of Induction).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
