    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   This is a cyclohexanone ring (ketone at C1).\n*   It has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at C3.\n*   It has an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at C5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH, then Benzyl Bromide**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Williamson Ether Synthesis.\n*   The starting material has an alcohol group (-CH₂OH) and a ketone. The proton on the alcohol's oxygen is the most acidic proton in the molecule (pKa ≈ 16-18, compared to α-protons of the ketone, pKa ≈ 19-20).\n*   NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will react with the electrophilic benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide.\n*   The result is the protection of the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** Formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n*   The ketone group (C=O) of Product 1 reacts with the hydrazine derivative under acidic catalysis. This is a condensation reaction that eliminates a molecule of water.\n*   The C=O double bond is replaced with a C=N-NH-Ts double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. Its full name would be N'-[3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene]-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** Shapiro Reaction.\n*   The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n*   Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used. The first deprotonates the -NH- group of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates a proton on the carbon α to the C=N bond (i.e., at C2 or C6 of the ring).\n*   The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate, TsLi). This generates a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond is formed where the ketone used to be, typically forming the less substituted alkene. Here, the new double bond will be between C1 and either C2 or C6.\n*   The aqueous NH₄Cl workup quenches the reaction by protonating the vinyllithium intermediate, replacing the lithium with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. The ring is now a cyclohexene. The original ketone is gone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are still present. The structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (or an isomer with the double bond between C1 and C6).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C and H₂**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.\n*   This powerful reduction system will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n*   1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds.\n    *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) → Isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (R-OBn) to produce an alcohol (R-OH) and toluene (PhCH₃) as a byproduct.\n    *   Benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   Combining these transformations, the final product has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is incorrect. The hydrazone moiety is removed in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This is incorrect. The benzyl ether would be cleaved in Step 4, and the butyl group from n-BuLi would not add to the carbon backbone in this reaction sequence.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard hydrogenation conditions with Pd/C would cleave this group. So this is an incomplete reaction product.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure correctly reflects the reduction of both alkenes and the cleavage of the benzyl ether, which are the expected outcomes of the final reaction step.\n\n<<<D>>>"
