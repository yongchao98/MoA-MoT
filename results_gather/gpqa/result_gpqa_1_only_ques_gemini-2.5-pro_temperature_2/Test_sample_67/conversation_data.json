    "This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle has spin 1/2 and a magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum operator and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   A magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}$ is applied along the +Z direction.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this system is $H_{initial} = - \\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B} = - \\gamma S_z B$.\n    *   The energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of $S_z$: $|+\\rangle$ (spin-up) with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$, and $|-\\rangle$ (spin-down) with eigenvalue $-\\hbar/2$. The corresponding energies are $E_+ = -\\gamma B \\hbar/2$ and $E_- = +\\gamma B \\hbar/2$.\n    *   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. Assuming $\\gamma > 0$ (a common convention if not specified), the lowest energy state is $E_+$, which corresponds to the spin-up state $|+\\rangle$. So, the initial state of the particle at $t=0$ is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to $\\vec{B}' = B \\hat{y}$.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian governing the time evolution of the system for $t > 0$ is $H = - \\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}' = - \\gamma B S_y$.\n    *   The \"sudden\" change means the state of the system right after the switch is the same as it was right before. So, the state at $t=0^+$ is still $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution and Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The time evolution of an observable's expectation value is driven by the energy differences in the system. The key insight is that the frequency of oscillation of an observable corresponds to the energy difference between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian that are populated, divided by Planck's constant $\\hbar$. This is the Bohr frequency condition.\n\n    *   **Eigenstates and Eigenenergies of the new Hamiltonian:** The new Hamiltonian is $H = - \\gamma B S_y$. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of the spin operator $S_y$. The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\\pm\\hbar/2$. Let's call the corresponding eigenstates $|S_y; +\\rangle$ and $|S_y; -\\rangle$.\n    *   The eigenenergies are:\n        *   $E_{y+} = - \\gamma B (+\\hbar/2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma B \\hbar$ (for the state $|S_y; +\\rangle$)\n        *   $E_{y-} = - \\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma B \\hbar$ (for the state $|S_y; -\\rangle$)\n    *   **Energy Difference:** The energy difference between these two states is:\n        $\\Delta E = E_{y-} - E_{y+} = \\left(+\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma B \\hbar\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma B \\hbar\\right) = \\gamma B \\hbar$.\n\n    *   **Superposition:** The initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian $H$. It must be expressed as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates, $|S_y; +\\rangle$ and $|S_y; -\\rangle$. In fact, it can be shown that $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|S_y; +\\rangle + |S_y; -\\rangle)$. Because the initial state is a superposition of these two energy states, the system will evolve as a superposition, and observables will oscillate.\n\n    *   **Oscillation Frequency:** The angular frequency of oscillation for any observable that connects these two energy states is given by the Bohr frequency rule:\n        $\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar}$\n        $\\omega = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B$\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$, will oscillate. For this oscillation to occur, the operator $S_z$ must have non-zero off-diagonal matrix elements between the energy eigenstates (i.e., $\\langle S_y; +|S_z|S_y; -\\rangle \\neq 0$), which it does. Therefore, its expectation value will oscillate with the angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\nThis phenomenon is Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector $\\langle \\vec{S} \\rangle$, initially pointing along the Z-axis, precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis naturally oscillates with this same frequency.\n\n<<<A>>>"
