    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. The Principle:**\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state ($\\Delta E$) to its lifetime ($\\Delta t$ or $\\tau$):\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s).\n\nThis principle means that a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy has a natural \"width\" or uncertainty, $\\Delta E$, approximately given by:\n$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    The lifetime is $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ sec.\n    The energy uncertainty is $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    The lifetime is $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ sec.\n    The energy uncertainty is $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n**3. The Condition for Resolvability:**\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be significantly larger than the uncertainty (or width) of either level. The state with the shorter lifetime ($\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ sec) has the larger energy width ($\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV), which is the limiting factor.\n\nTherefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n$|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1$\n$|E_1 - E_2| > 6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options:**\n\n*   A) $10^{-9}$ eV is less than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   B) $10^{-8}$ eV is less than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   C) $10^{-11}$ eV is less than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   D) $10^{-4}$ eV is much greater than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy separation that is large enough to be clearly resolved from the natural energy widths of the states.\n\n<<<D>>>"
