    "Let's break down each option:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory describing the strong nuclear force. Like other quantum field theories involving point particles, calculations involving loop diagrams (representing virtual particles) lead to integrals that diverge at high energies (or short distances). To make sense of the theory, a procedure called **regularization** is required to temporarily tame these infinities, followed by renormalization to absorb them into physical quantities. So, QCD requires regularization.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, is not a quantum theory. It doesn't include the concept of virtual particle loops that cause the high-energy divergences characteristic of quantum field theories. While it has its own problem with infinities (e.g., the infinite self-energy of a point charge), it doesn't undergo the specific procedure of \"regularization at high energies\" in the sense used in quantum field theory to handle loop diagrams. However, the theory that supplants it at high energies, QED, does.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It was the first theory where regularization and renormalization were successfully applied to deal with infinite quantities arising from loop diagrams. So, QED absolutely requires regularization.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. One of its most celebrated features is that it is believed to be \"UV-finite.\" Unlike theories based on point particles, string theory's fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings. The interactions are therefore \"smeared out\" in spacetime, which smooths out the short-distance (high-energy) behavior that causes divergences in traditional quantum field theories. Because of this, loop calculations in string theory are expected to yield finite results without the need for regularization.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the theory on this list that is constructed in a way that is not expected to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
