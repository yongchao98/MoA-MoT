    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the IUPAC name:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the description and draw the molecule:**\n    *   The parent structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The highest priority group is the carboxylic acid, so the parent name will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH is C1.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\". This places the methoxy (-OCH3) group at C4.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\". This places a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group at C2 and C6. We don't yet know which is at C2 and which is at C6.\n    *   \"A carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another [with the carboxylic acid]\". Since the -COOH is at C1, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at C3 and C5. We don't yet know which is at C3 and which is at C5.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\". This is the key clue to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is fixed at C4. The nitrile (-CN) must be ortho to it, so the -CN group must be at C3 or C5.\n        *   **Case 1:** If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, its other ortho position is C2. The description says the alcohol (-OH) is also ortho to the nitrile, so the -OH must be at C2.\n        *   **Case 2:** If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, its other ortho position is C6. The -OH must therefore be at C6.\n    *   Now, we reconcile this with the fact that -OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6.\n        *   In Case 1, since -OH is at C2, the -N(CH3)2 must be at C6.\n        *   In Case 2, since -OH is at C6, the -N(CH3)2 must be at C2.\n    *   Finally, we place the carbaldehyde (-CHO). The -CHO and -CN groups are at C3 and C5.\n        *   In Case 1, since -CN is at C3, the -CHO must be at C5.\n        *   In Case 2, since -CN is at C5, the -CHO must be at C3.\n\n    This gives us two potential structures that seem different but are actually just rotated/flipped versions of the same molecule. Let's work with the structure from Case 1:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n2.  **Number the ring according to IUPAC rules:**\n    *   C1 is assigned to the principal functional group (-COOH).\n    *   We need to number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents. Both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering from C1 give the same locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   When the locant sets are identical, we must use a tie-breaker. The rule is to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n    *   Let's list the prefixes alphabetically: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   Let's see which numbering path gives the lowest locant to 'cyano'.\n        *   **Clockwise path:** C2=-OH, C3=-CN, C4=-OCH3, C5=-CHO, C6=-N(CH3)2. The 'cyano' group is at position **3**.\n        *   **Counter-clockwise path:** C2=-N(CH3)2, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH3, C5=-CN, C6=-OH. The 'cyano' group is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering path is correct.\n\n3.  **Assemble the final name:**\n    *   Using the correct (clockwise) numbering, we have the following substituents and locants:\n        *   cyano: 3\n        *   dimethylamino: 6\n        *   formyl: 5\n        *   hydroxy: 2\n        *   methoxy: 4\n    *   The prefixes are listed in alphabetical order in the final name.\n    *   The name is constructed as: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect prefix order)\n    *   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect prefix order)\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name perfectly)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Uses incorrect numbering)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
