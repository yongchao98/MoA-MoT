    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Nature of the Decay (Continuous vs. Discrete Spectrum)**\n    *   The original decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`. Ignoring the heavy recoiling nucleons (2B), there are four light particles in the final state (`E`, `E`, `V`, `V`). When a decay results in three or more final particles, the available energy (the Q-value) is shared among them in a statistical way. This means that the total energy of any subset of these particles (like the two E particles) will vary from event to event, resulting in a **continuous** energy spectrum. This is explicitly stated in the problem.\n    *   The variant decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`. In this case, there are three light particles in the final state (`E`, `E`, `M`). Since this is still a multi-body decay (more than two final particles), the energy will again be shared among them. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles will also be **continuous**.\n    *   This immediately rules out options C and D, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Endpoint of the Spectrum**\n    *   The endpoint of the energy spectrum represents the maximum possible total kinetic energy the E particles can have. This maximum value is achieved when the *other* emitted particles (`2V` or `M`) carry away the minimum possible amount of energy.\n    *   The total energy released by the nuclear transition `2A -> 2B` is fixed. Let's call this energy `ΔE_nuc`. This energy must account for the creation of the new particles (their rest mass energy) and their kinetic energies.\n    *   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`. The total energy released, `ΔE_nuc`, is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the products:\n        `ΔE_nuc = KE_B + KE_E_sum + 2*m_E*c² + KE_V_sum + 2*m_V*c²`\n        The endpoint of the E-particle spectrum (`Q`) occurs when their kinetic energy `KE_E_sum` is maximized. This happens when the kinetic energy of the other particles (`KE_B` and `KE_V_sum`) is minimized (i.e., zero). So the endpoint `Q` is:\n        `Q = ΔE_nuc - 2*m_E*c² - 2*m_V*c²`\n        The term `2*m_V*c²` is the energy that *must* go into creating the rest mass of the two V particles, even if their kinetic energy is zero. The problem states V is \"much lighter\", which implies it has a small but non-zero mass (`m_V > 0`).\n\n    *   **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`. The energy conservation equation is:\n        `ΔE_nuc = KE_B + KE_E_sum + 2*m_E*c² + KE_M + m_M*c²`\n        The endpoint of this new spectrum (`Q'`) occurs when `KE_B` and `KE_M` are zero. The problem states that particle `M` is **massless** (`m_M = 0`). So the new endpoint `Q'` is:\n        `Q' = ΔE_nuc - 2*m_E*c² - 0`\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Original endpoint: `Q = (ΔE_nuc - 2*m_E*c²) - 2*m_V*c²`\n        *   New endpoint: `Q' = (ΔE_nuc - 2*m_E*c²) `\n    *   Since `m_V > 0`, the term `2*m_V*c²` is positive. This means `Q' > Q`. In the variant decay, no energy is required to create the rest mass of the exotic particle M, so more energy is available as kinetic energy for the E particles.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectrum remains continuous, but its endpoint value increases.\n\n<<<A>>>"
