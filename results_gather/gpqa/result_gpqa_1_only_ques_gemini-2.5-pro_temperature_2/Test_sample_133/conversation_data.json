    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n**1. Calculate the total moles of H⁺ ions from the acids.**\n\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong monoprotic acid (provides 1 H⁺ ion per molecule).\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **H₂SO₄ (Sulfuric acid):**\n    *   H₂SO₄ is a strong diprotic acid (provides 2 H⁺ ions per molecule).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = (moles from HCl) + (moles from H₂SO₄) = 0.100 mol + 0.180 mol = **0.280 mol**\n\n**2. Calculate the total moles of OH⁻ ions from the base.**\n\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (Barium hydroxide):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit.\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.100 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.100 mol = **0.200 mol**\n\n**3. Determine the limiting reactant and moles of water formed.**\n\n*   The neutralization reaction is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n*   We are mixing 0.280 mol of H⁺ with 0.200 mol of OH⁻.\n*   Since the number of moles of OH⁻ is less than the number of moles of H⁺, **OH⁻ is the limiting reactant**.\n*   The reaction will proceed until all the OH⁻ ions are consumed. Therefore, the number of moles of water formed will be equal to the initial moles of OH⁻.\n*   Moles of H₂O formed = **0.200 mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization.**\n\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal per mole of water formed (or -57.1 kJ/mol). Textbooks often use the value -13.6 kcal/mol. Let's use this value as it often appears in multiple-choice questions.\n*   Enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) = Moles of H₂O formed × Standard enthalpy of neutralization\n*   ΔH = 0.200 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   ΔH = **-2.72 kcal**\n\nNote: The reaction between Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ forms a precipitate (BaSO₄), which also releases heat (enthalpy of precipitation). However, the term \"enthalpy of neutralization\" specifically refers to the heat released from the H⁺ and OH⁻ reaction. The calculated value of -2.72 kcal matches one of the options perfectly, indicating that this is the intended answer and the precipitation effect is to be ignored.\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
