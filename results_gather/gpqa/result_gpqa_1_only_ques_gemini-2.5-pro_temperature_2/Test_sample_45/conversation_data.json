    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactant and the reaction.**\n    The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. The term \"racemic\" means we have a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH₂=CH-C*H(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), where C* is the chiral center at position 3.\n\n    The reagent is Grubbs catalyst, which is used for olefin metathesis. Since only one type of alkene is present (albeit as a racemic mixture), the reaction is a self-metathesis.\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the general structure of the product.**\n    Self-metathesis of a terminal alkene of the form R-CH=CH₂ results in the formation of a symmetrical internal alkene and ethene:\n    2 R-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂\n\n    In our case, the 'R' group is the chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). The product (excluding ethene) will have the structure:\n    CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃\n    This molecule is named **3,6-dimethyl-4-octene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the product.**\n    The product, 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene, has three potential stereogenic elements:\n    1.  A chiral center at carbon 3 (C3).\n    2.  A chiral center at carbon 6 (C6).\n    3.  A double bond at C4-C5, which can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry.\n\n*   **Step 4: Consider the possible combinations of reactants from the racemic mixture.**\n    Since the starting material is a mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, three types of reactions can occur:\n    1.  Reaction between two molecules of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    2.  Reaction between two molecules of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    3.  Reaction between one molecule of (R)- and one molecule of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the stereoisomers formed from each reaction.**\n    Olefin metathesis with Grubbs catalyst does not affect existing chiral centers, but it typically forms a mixture of E and Z isomers of the new double bond.\n\n    1.  **(R)-alkene + (R)-alkene:** This reaction yields (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. Since the new double bond can be E or Z, two products are formed:\n        *   (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral)\n        *   (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral)\n        These are two distinct products.\n\n    2.  **(S)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This reaction yields (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. Again, two geometric isomers are possible:\n        *   (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral, the enantiomer of the E,3R,6R isomer)\n        *   (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral, the enantiomer of the Z,3R,6R isomer)\n        Since enantiomers are different compounds, these are two more distinct products, bringing the total to four.\n\n    3.  **(R)-alkene + (S)-alkene:** This cross-metathesis yields (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of its E and Z isomers.\n        *   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene:** This molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a *meso* compound. It is one distinct product.\n        *   **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. This is also a *meso* compound. It is a diastereomer of the E-meso isomer and is therefore another distinct product.\n\n*   **Step 6: Tally the total number of distinct products.**\n    From reaction 1: 2 chiral products.\n    From reaction 2: 2 chiral products (the enantiomers of the first two).\n    From reaction 3: 2 achiral (meso) products.\n\n    Total number of distinct stereoisomers = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nAll six of these stereoisomers are possible products from the reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
