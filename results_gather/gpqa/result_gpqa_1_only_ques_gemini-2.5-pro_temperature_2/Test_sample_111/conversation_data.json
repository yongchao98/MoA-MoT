    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the given state vector. The unnormalized state is:\n|ψ> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>\n\nIn matrix form, with |up> = [1, 0]^T and |down> = [0, 1]^T, this is:\n|ψ> =  [ (1+i) ]\n      [ (2-i) ]\n\nTo normalize it, we calculate the squared norm <ψ|ψ>:\n<ψ| = [ (1-i) , (2+i) ] (This is the conjugate transpose of |ψ>)\n\n<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)\n<ψ|ψ> = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²)\n<ψ|ψ> = (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThe normalization constant N is 1/sqrt(<ψ|ψ>), so N = 1/√7.\n\nThe normalized state |alpha> is:\n|alpha> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n|alpha> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i) ]\n                    [ (2-i) ]\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has elements Aij = hbar/2 for i ≠ j, and Aij = 0 for i = j. For a 2x2 system (spin-1/2), this gives the matrix:\nA =  [ 0      hbar/2 ]\n     [ hbar/2   0     ]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet | -λ      hbar/2 |  =  λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0\n    | hbar/2   -λ    |\n\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\nλ₁ = +hbar/2\nλ₂ = -hbar/2\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n\n**For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n(A - λ₁I)|v₁> = 0\n| -hbar/2   hbar/2 | |x| = |0|\n| hbar/2   -hbar/2 | |y|   |0|\nThis leads to the equation -x + y = 0, so x = y. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, 1]^T.\nThe normalized eigenvector |v₁> is (1/√2) * [1, 1]^T, or |v₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n**For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n(A - λ₂I)|v₂> = 0\n| hbar/2   hbar/2 | |x| = |0|\n| hbar/2   hbar/2 | |y|   |0|\nThis leads to the equation x + y = 0, so x = -y. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, -1]^T.\nThe normalized eigenvector |v₂> is (1/√2) * [1, -1]^T, or |v₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue λi is given by P(λi) = |<vᵢ|alpha>|².\n\n**Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\nP(λ₁) = |<v₁|alpha>|²\n<v₁| = (1/√2) * [1, 1]\n<v₁|alpha> = (1/√2) * [1, 1] * (1/√7) * [ (1+i) ]\n                                          [ (2-i) ]\n<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]\n<v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\nP(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n**Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\nP(λ₂) = |<v₂|alpha>|²\n<v₂| = (1/√2) * [1, -1]\n<v₂|alpha> = (1/√2) * [1, -1] * (1/√7) * [ (1+i) ]\n                                           [ (2-i) ]\n<v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]\n<v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\nP(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nSo the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average (or expectation) value <A> can be calculated using the formula <A> = Σ P(λi) * λi.\n<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂\n<A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)\n<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)\n<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14)\n<A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7)\n<A> = hbar/7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14 ≈ 0.36. The average value of the operator is hbar/7.\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
