    "This problem requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths (MFP) within the same volume of residual gas:\n1.  **λ1**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n2.  **λ2**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron colliding with those same gas molecules.\n\nLet's analyze the physics behind each of these.\n\n**1. Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1)**\n\nThe mean free path of a gas molecule is the average distance it travels before colliding with another gas molecule. A simplified but standard formula for this is:\n$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d_g^2 n}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $n$ is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n*   $d_g$ is the kinetic diameter of the gas molecules.\n*   $\\pi d_g^2$ is the collision cross-section, representing the effective \"target area\" one molecule presents to another.\n*   The factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in motion, not stationary.\n\n**2. Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2)**\n\nThe mean free path of an electron is the average distance it travels before being significantly scattered by a gas molecule. The formula is:\n$\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{e-g} n}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $n$ is the same number density of gas molecules.\n*   $\\sigma_{e-g}$ is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n*   Note: The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV (1 MeV), meaning they are relativistic and travel at a speed very close to the speed of light (~0.94c). The gas molecules at room temperature have thermal velocities that are many orders of magnitude slower. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered as stationary targets for the electrons, and a factor like $\\sqrt{2}$ is not needed.\n\n**Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nThe relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the comparison of their respective collision cross-sections: the effective gas-gas cross-section ($\\sqrt{2} \\pi d_g^2$) versus the electron-gas cross-section ($\\sigma_{e-g}$).\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Collisions**: These are interactions between two relatively slow-moving, similarly sized objects. The collision cross-section is directly related to the physical size of the molecules ($d_g$).\n*   **Electron-Gas Collisions**: This involves a very high-energy (1 MeV), point-like particle (the electron) interacting with a gas molecule. Because of its extremely high kinetic energy, the electron is very \"stiff\" and penetrating. It is not easily deflected by the diffuse electron cloud of the gas molecule. A significant scattering event (a \"collision\") requires a much closer encounter, typically with the strong Coulomb field of the molecule's nucleus. This means the effective target area that the molecule presents to the high-energy electron ($\\sigma_{e-g}$) is much smaller than its physical kinetic cross-section ($\\pi d_g^2$).\n\nTherefore, we can confidently state that:\n$\\sigma_{e-g} \\ll \\sqrt{2} \\pi d_g^2$\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section ($\\lambda = 1/(n\\sigma)$), a much smaller cross-section results in a much longer mean free path.\nConsequently, we must have:\n$\\lambda_2 \\gg \\lambda_1$\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1**: This is consistent with our conclusion that λ2 is much larger than λ1. A textbook hard-sphere model, for instance, predicts $\\lambda_2 = 4\\sqrt{2} \\lambda_1 \\approx 5.66 \\lambda_1$, which satisfies this condition. More realistic calculations for high-energy electrons would yield an even larger ratio.\n*   **B) λ2 < λ1**: This is incorrect. It would imply electrons are scattered more easily than gas molecules, which is contrary to the physics of high-energy particles.\n*   **C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation**: This is incorrect, as the two physical processes are fundamentally different, leading to different cross-sections and mean free paths.\n*   **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1**: This is incorrect. While it correctly states λ2 > λ1, it puts an upper bound on λ2 that is far too restrictive and physically unrealistic. It suggests the electron MFP is only slightly larger than the gas MFP, which contradicts the highly penetrating nature of 1 MeV electrons.\n\nBased on the physical principles, the mean free path for the high-energy electrons must be significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules among themselves. Option A is the only choice that correctly reflects this reality.\n\n<<<A>>>"
