    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer. The stereocenter is at carbon C5.\n    ```\n        O       OCH3\n        ||       |\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH-CH3\n    (S configuration at C5)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S configuration). The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Products 1A and 1B have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. So, Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    ```\n       O       O\n       ||      ||\n    CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Transformation:** Excess NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor with achiral reagents, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol is the same meso compound (just rotated).\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: one meso compound and one racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they **cannot be separated**. They will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and **can be separated**.\n*   **Structurally different compounds** (like a methoxy-alcohol vs. a diol) have different polarities and **can be separated**.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n*   The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from it, giving another **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols), so they will elute at different times.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n*   It can separate **enantiomers**.\n*   It can separate **diastereomers**.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   Since all five compounds in the mixture are stereochemically unique (even the meso compound is unique from the others), the chiral column will resolve all of them, assuming the column has sufficient resolving power (which is a standard assumption in such problems).\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) -> Peak 5\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis predicts **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
