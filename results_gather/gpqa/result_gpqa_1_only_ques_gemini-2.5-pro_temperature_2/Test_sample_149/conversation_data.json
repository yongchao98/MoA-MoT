    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond or ring (1 degree), which is consistent with a C=O bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a CH2 group.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is adjacent to a single proton (the aldehyde proton). This confirms the fragment -CH2-CHO (phenylacetaldehyde skeleton).\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2) due to proton exchange.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    The fragments are a -CH2-CHO group, an -NH2 group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. Combining these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The para-substitution is confirmed by the two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\n    **Starting Material:**\n     \n\n**Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, followed by H2O.**\n    1.  `NaNO2 + HCl` at low temperatures converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). This is the **diazotization reaction**.\n    2.  Adding `H2O` to the diazonium salt and warming causes hydrolysis, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    This two-step process converts the starting 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    **Intermediate Product:**\n     \n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that has protons on its α-carbon (the CH2 group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, such aldehydes undergo an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        The addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option B).\n\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **Heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n    The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    **Final Product:**\n     ![2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) but-2-enal](https://i.imgur.com/tYt6G5z.png)\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product to the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heated conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This structure perfectly matches the final product of the aldol condensation.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
