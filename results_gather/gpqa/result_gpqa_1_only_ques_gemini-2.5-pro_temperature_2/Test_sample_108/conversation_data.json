    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers:\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => `S_i = 0` (total spin). This is a singlet state.\n    *   `L` is represented by `S` => `L_i = 0` (total orbital angular momentum).\n    *   `J` is the number `0` => `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum).\n*   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system requires that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial state, `L_i + S_i + T_i = 0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This implies the initial isospin must be `T_i = 1`.\n\n**2. Understand the Particle X**\n\n*   Particle X is emitted from the NN system.\n*   It has an intrinsic parity of `P_X_intrinsic = -1`.\n*   It is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   We will assume particle X has a spin of `s_X = 0`, as is common for emitted mesons like pions in this type of problem, and is implied by angular momentum conservation for a J=0 initial state as shown below.\n\n**3. State the Conservation Laws and Constraints**\n\nFor the reaction `NN_initial -> NN_final + X` to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions:\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The initial total angular momentum `J_i` must equal the final total angular momentum `J_f_total`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming `s_X=0`).\n    *   `J_i = 0`. So, the vector sum **J_f** + **l_X** must be zero. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity `P_i` must equal the total final parity `P_f_total`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_f_total = P_f(NN) * P_X`, where `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f` and the parity of the emitted particle `X` is the product of its intrinsic and orbital parities: `P_X = P_X_intrinsic * (-1)^l_X = (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem provides the rule that for the final state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Constraint on NN Spin:** A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n\n**4. Analyze Each Option**\n\nLet's check each potential reaction against these four rules. A reaction is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n*   Check 1 (Ang. Mom.): `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   Check 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   Check 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   Check 4 (NN Spin): `S_f = 1`. This is allowed.\n*   **Conclusion: This partial wave is not permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check 1 (Ang. Mom.): `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   Check 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   Check 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   Check 4 (NN Spin): `S_f = 1`. This is allowed.\n*   **Conclusion: This partial wave is permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   This option fails Check 4 immediately. The total spin of two nucleons cannot be `S=3`. This state is not a valid two-nucleon state. Therefore, this partial wave is fundamentally not permitted, regardless of the transition dynamics.\n*   **Conclusion: This partial wave is not permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n*   Check 1 (Ang. Mom.): `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   Check 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   Check 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   Check 4 (NN Spin): `S_f = 1`. This is allowed.\n*   **Conclusion: This partial wave is permitted.**\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nWe have found that both option A and option C describe non-permitted processes.\n*   **Option A** is forbidden because it violates the selection rule derived from the Pauli principle as stated in the problem (`S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T=0` final state).\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the proposed final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer, we must decide which is the most likely intended answer. The problem explicitly details the Pauli principle rule and the condition `T(NN) = 0`. The violation in option A is found by directly applying this specific information. The violation in option C stems from a more general principle (spin addition) not explicitly mentioned. It is common in such problems that the intended solution path relies on the specific rules provided. Therefore, the violation of the Pauli statistics rule highlighted in the problem statement is the most probable reason for a partial wave to be deemed \"not permitted\" in this context.\n\n<<<A>>>"
