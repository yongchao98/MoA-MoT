    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff,*} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff,*}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star for a circular orbit).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n\n**Step 2: Find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Let's write the formula for each planet and then divide them:\n\n$T_{eq,1} = T_{eff,*} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}$\n$T_{eq,2} = T_{eff,*} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{eff,*}$ and $R_*$ are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$. We can cancel these common terms when we take the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff,*} (\\frac{R_*}{2a_1})^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff,*} (\\frac{R_*}{2a_2})^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{a_1})^{1/2}}{(\\frac{1}{a_2})^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the semi-major axis to the given radial velocity data**\n\nThe problem provides the Doppler shift caused by each planet, which allows us to determine their radial velocity (RV) amplitudes ($K$). The formula for the RV amplitude of the star, assuming a circular orbit and that the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_*$), is:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, so we can assume $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nNow, we can solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G M_*}{M_*^2 a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$)**\n\nUsing the formula for $a$, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms $G$ and $M_*$ are the same for both planets and will cancel out.\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow we substitute the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   The RV amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$).\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nSo, the ratios are:\n*   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nPlug these ratios into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final temperature ratio**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into our temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{225}{784}\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
