    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the source of radiation.**\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution that has a spheroidal shape with the z-axis as its axis of symmetry. An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The characteristics of the radiation depend on the nature of the oscillation, which can be categorized by multipole moments (monopole, dipole, quadrupole, etc.).\n\n2.  **Determine the dominant type of radiation.**\n    *   **Monopole radiation:** An oscillating monopole moment (total charge) would violate charge conservation. A spherically symmetric radial pulsation of charge does not radiate (a consequence of Birkhoff's theorem). Thus, we can exclude monopole radiation.\n    *   **Electric dipole radiation:** This is produced by an oscillating electric dipole moment, $\\mathbf{p}(t)$. This would be the case if the entire spheroidal charge distribution were oscillating as a rigid body along the z-axis. The power distribution for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is $\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\omega^4 \\sin^2\\theta \\propto \\lambda^{-4} \\sin^2\\theta$.\n    *   **Electric quadrupole radiation:** This is produced by an oscillating electric quadrupole moment. This occurs when the charge distribution deforms in a way that its dipole moment remains zero. For a spheroid with its center at the origin, a natural oscillation mode is a deformation of its shape (e.g., oscillating between a prolate and an oblate spheroid) along the symmetry axis. This kind of oscillation maintains a zero electric dipole moment, so the dominant radiation is electric quadrupole radiation.\n    *   **Which interpretation is more likely?** The problem specifically mentions the \"spheroid shape\". If the intended answer were dipole radiation, the shape would be largely irrelevant (any compact object oscillating rigidly acts as a dipole). The mention of a specific non-spherical shape is a strong hint that the geometry of the source is crucial, pointing towards quadrupole radiation arising from the deformation of this shape. Therefore, we assume the radiation is primarily electric quadrupole radiation.\n\n3.  **Find the angular distribution of power for electric quadrupole radiation.**\n    For an electric quadrupole source with axial symmetry about the z-axis (like our oscillating spheroid), the radiated power per unit solid angle, $\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}$, in the radiation zone is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\sin^2\\theta \\cos^2\\theta $$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle with the symmetry axis (z-axis). The full functional form is $f(\\lambda, \\theta) = C \\lambda^{-6} \\sin^2\\theta \\cos^2\\theta$ for some constant $C$. The power of the frequency $\\omega$ is $\\omega^6$, and since $\\omega = 2\\pi c / \\lambda$, the power is proportional to $\\lambda^{-6}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle (A).**\n    To find the maximum power, we need to find the maximum value of the angular function $g(\\theta) = \\sin^2\\theta \\cos^2\\theta$.\n    We can rewrite this as $g(\\theta) = (\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta))^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\sin^2(2\\theta)$.\n    The maximum value of $\\sin^2(2\\theta)$ is 1, which occurs when $2\\theta = 90^\\circ$, so $\\theta = 45^\\circ$.\n    The maximum value of the angular function is $g(45^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    So, the maximum power is $A \\propto \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$.**\n    At $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, the angular function is:\n    $g(30^\\circ) = \\sin^2(30^\\circ)\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3}{16}$.\n    The power radiated at this angle is proportional to $3/16$.\n\n6.  **Find the fraction of the maximum power.**\n    The fraction is the ratio of the power at $\\theta=30^\\circ$ to the maximum power:\n    $$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Power at } 30^\\circ}{\\text{Maximum Power}} = \\frac{g(30^\\circ)}{g(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{3/16}{1/4} = \\frac{3}{16} \\times 4 = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n\n7.  **Identify the possible form of the function f.**\n    As established in step 3, for electric quadrupole radiation, the power radiated is proportional to $\\omega^6$, which means it's proportional to $\\lambda^{-6}$. So a possible form for the function $f$ includes the factor $\\lambda^{-6}$.\n\n8.  **Combine the results and choose the correct option.**\n    The fraction of maximum power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is $3/4$, and a possible functional dependence on wavelength is $\\lambda^{-6}$. This matches option A.\n\nLet's briefly consider the dipole case (Option B) for completeness.\nFor a dipole, $\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\lambda^{-4} \\sin^2\\theta$.\nMaximum power is at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, where $\\sin^2(90^\\circ)=1$.\nPower at $\\theta=30^\\circ$ is proportional to $\\sin^2(30^\\circ)=(1/2)^2=1/4$.\nThe fraction is $(1/4)/1 = 1/4$.\nThe wavelength dependence is $\\lambda^{-4}$.\nThis matches option B.\nHowever, as argued in step 2, the quadrupole model is the more appropriate interpretation of the problem statement.\n\nFinal Answer is based on the quadrupole model.\nFraction: 3/4\nForm: $\\lambda^{-6}$\n\nThis corresponds to Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
