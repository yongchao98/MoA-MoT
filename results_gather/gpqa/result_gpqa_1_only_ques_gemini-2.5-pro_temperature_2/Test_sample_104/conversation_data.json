    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Flux Variation Due to Starspots\n\nThe brightness variation, or amplitude of the signal, is caused by the difference in flux between the fully unspotted hemisphere and the partially spotted hemisphere rotating into view.\n\n*   The flux (F) emitted per unit area of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $F = \\sigma T_{eff}^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature.\n*   The total luminosity (L) from a hemisphere facing the observer is the flux integrated over its projected area ($A_{hemi}$). Therefore, $L \\propto A_{hemi} \\cdot T^4$. Since the observed flux is proportional to luminosity, we can compare the luminosity of the two hemispheres.\n\n**Maximum Flux ($L_{max}$):**\nThis occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer.\n$L_{max} \\propto A_{hemi} \\cdot T_{star}^4$\nGiven $T_{star} = 6000$ K.\n\n**Minimum Flux ($L_{min}$):**\nThis occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction (filling factor, f = 0.20) of its area covered by cooler spots and the rest (1-f = 0.80) at the star's normal temperature.\n*   Temperature of spots: $T_{spot} = T_{star} - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K$.\n*   Luminosity from the unspotted part of this hemisphere: $\\propto (1-f) \\cdot A_{hemi} \\cdot T_{star}^4$\n*   Luminosity from the spotty part of this hemisphere: $\\propto f \\cdot A_{hemi} \\cdot T_{spot}^4$\nThe total minimum luminosity is the sum of these two components:\n$L_{min} \\propto (1-f) \\cdot A_{hemi} \\cdot T_{star}^4 + f \\cdot A_{hemi} \\cdot T_{spot}^4$\n$L_{min} \\propto A_{hemi} \\cdot [(1-f)T_{star}^4 + f \\cdot T_{spot}^4]$\n\n**Amplitude of the Spot Signal:**\nThe amplitude is the fractional drop in brightness:\n$Amplitude_{spots} = \\frac{L_{max} - L_{min}}{L_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{L_{min}}{L_{max}}$\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $L_{max}$ and $L_{min}$:\n$\\frac{L_{min}}{L_{max}} = \\frac{A_{hemi} \\cdot [(1-f)T_{star}^4 + f \\cdot T_{spot}^4]}{A_{hemi} \\cdot T_{star}^4} = (1-f) + f \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{star}}\\right)^4$\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n$\\frac{L_{min}}{L_{max}} = (1 - 0.20) + 0.20 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4$\n$\\frac{L_{min}}{L_{max}} = 0.8 + 0.2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4$\n$\\frac{L_{min}}{L_{max}} = 0.8 + 0.2 \\cdot (0.48225...) \\approx 0.8 + 0.09645 = 0.89645$\n\nThe amplitude of the spot signal is:\n$Amplitude_{spots} = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Amplitude of a Hypothetical Exoplanet Transit\n\nAn exoplanet passing in front of its star (a transit) causes a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this signal (the transit depth) is the ratio of the projected area of the planet to the projected area of the star.\n$Amplitude_{planet} = \\frac{\\text{Area of planet}}{\\text{Area of star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n### 3. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve\n\nWe want the amplitude from the planet transit to be the same as the amplitude from the starspots.\n$Amplitude_{planet} = Amplitude_{spots}$\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.10355$\n\nNow, solve for the relative radius $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}$:\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.3218$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
