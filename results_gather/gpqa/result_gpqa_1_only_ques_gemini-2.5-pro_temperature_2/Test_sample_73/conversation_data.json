    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\nThe key principle here is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"get old\" or become \"more likely\" to decay just because it has survived for some time.\n\nTherefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed is irrelevant to the future probability. We simply need to calculate the probability that a fresh atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 1: Find the decay constant (λ)**\n\nThe probability of a single atom surviving for a time `t` is given by the formula:\nP(survive) = e^(-λt)\n\nThe probability of it decaying within time `t` is:\nP(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the decay probability is 32% (or 0.32) within 100 minutes. We can use this to find the decay constant λ.\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the survival part:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to solve for λ:\nln(e^(-λ * 100)) = ln(0.68)\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\nλ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100\nλ ≈ 0.003857 per minute\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes**\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, we want to find the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nNow, we substitute the value of λ we found:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.5785)\n\nNow calculate the value of e^(-0.5785):\ne^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, calculate the decay probability:\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nSo, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
