    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the relative populations of different energy levels of an atom are described by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms ($N_j$) in an excited energy state $j$ to the number of atoms ($N_i$) in a lower energy state $i$ is given by:\n    $ \\frac{N_j}{N_i} = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}\\right) $\n    where:\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_j - E_i$ is the energy difference between the two states.\n    *   $g_j$ and $g_i$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Translate the problem statement into a mathematical relationship:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number in a lower state (e.g., the ground state) is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2. Let's denote this ratio for star_1 (with temperature $T_1$) and star_2 (with temperature $T_2$):\n    $ \\left(\\frac{N_j}{N_i}\\right)_1 = 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{N_j}{N_i}\\right)_2 $\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to both stars:**\n    For star_1:\n    $ \\left(\\frac{N_j}{N_i}\\right)_1 = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}\\right) $\n    For star_2:\n    $ \\left(\\frac{N_j}{N_i}\\right)_2 = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}\\right) $\n    The energy difference $\\Delta E$ and the statistical weights $g_j, g_i$ are properties of the iron atom and are the same for both stars.\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 3:**\n    $ \\frac{g_j}{g_i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}\\right) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{g_j}{g_i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}\\right) $\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term $\\frac{g_j}{g_i}$ cancels out from both sides:\n    $ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}\\right) = 2 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}\\right) $\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    $ \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(2 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}\\right)\\right) $\n    Using the logarithm property $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$:\n    $ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}\\right)\\right) $\n    $ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} $\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):**\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) $\n    Factor out the common term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n\n9.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem states the energy difference is $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J. The Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n    Let's calculate the value of the pre-factor $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 1 \\text{ K} $\n\n10. **Substitute this value back into the equation:**\n    $ (1 \\text{ K}) \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n    This simplifies to:\n    $ \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \\ln(2) $\n    (Note: In many physics problems, especially multiple-choice, units are handled implicitly. The form of the equation is what matters.)\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
