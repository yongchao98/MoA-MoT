    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry and Definitions**\n\n*   **Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star. An occultation is when it passes behind. For circular, co-planar orbits, if a transit happens, an occultation will happen half an orbit later. The geometric conditions are the same for both events.\n*   **Impact Parameter (b):** This is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star during a transit, measured in units of the star's radius ($R_s$). It is given by the formula:\n    $b = \\frac{a \\cdot \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n    where:\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis (the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle of the orbital plane relative to our line of sight; i=90Â° is a perfect edge-on view).\n*   **Co-planar Orbits:** Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, their inclination ($i$) is the same.\n\n**2. Relate the Orbits of the Two Planets**\n\nWe have two planets orbiting the same star in the same plane. Let's write the impact parameter equation for each:\n\n*   For Planet 1: $b_1 = \\frac{a_1 \\cdot \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n*   For Planet 2: $b_2 = \\frac{a_2 \\cdot \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n\nSince $R_s$ and $\\cos(i)$ are the same for both, we can find the ratio of their orbital radii by dividing the two equations:\n\n$\\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{a_2 \\cdot \\cos(i) / R_s}{a_1 \\cdot \\cos(i) / R_s} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\nThis is a key relationship: the ratio of the impact parameters is equal to the ratio of their orbital radii.\n\n**3. Use Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$).\n\n$(\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^2 = (\\frac{a_2}{a_1})^3$\n\nWe can now substitute the relationship we found in step 2:\n\n$(\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^2 = (\\frac{b_2}{b_1})^3$\n\nSolving for $P_2$, we get:\n\n$P_2 = P_1 \\cdot (\\frac{b_2}{b_1})^{3/2}$\n\n**4. Determine the Maximum Impact Parameter for Planet 2**\n\nWe want to find the *maximum* orbital period for Planet 2 that still allows for a transit. This means we need to find the maximum possible orbital radius ($a_{2,max}$), which corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter ($b_{2,max}$) for a transit.\n\nA transit event occurs when the planet passes in front of the star. A common and standard definition for a transit to occur is that the *center* of the planet must pass over the star's disk. The limiting case is when the center of the planet passes exactly along the edge of the star. In this case, the projected distance from the star's center is equal to the star's radius, $R_s$.\nTherefore, the maximum impact parameter is:\n\n$b_{2,max} = \\frac{R_s}{R_s} = 1$\n\n(Note: A more precise condition for a *grazing* transit is $b_{max} = 1 + R_p/R_s$. However, using $b_{max} = 1$ is a standard convention and, as we'll see, leads directly to one of the answers. The provided planet and star radii are distractors if this interpretation is used.)\n\n**5. Calculate the Maximum Period**\n\nNow we have all the pieces to calculate the maximum period for Planet 2 ($P_{2,max}$):\n\n*   $P_1 = 3$ days\n*   $b_1 = 0.2$\n*   $b_{2,max} = 1$\n\nPlug these values into our final equation from Step 3:\n\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{0.2})^{3/2}$\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\cdot (5)^{3/2}$\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\cdot (5^{1.5})$\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5^3} = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{125}$\n$P_{2,max} \\approx 3 \\cdot 11.1803$\n$P_{2,max} \\approx 33.54$ days\n\nThis value is extremely close to 33.5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
