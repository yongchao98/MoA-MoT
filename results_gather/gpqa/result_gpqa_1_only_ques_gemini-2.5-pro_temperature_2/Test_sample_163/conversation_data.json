    "To determine the ratio of the masses of the two binary star systems, we can use the information from their periods and radial velocity curves. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (M = M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n$M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{P}{2\\pi G \\sin^3 i} (K_1 + K_2)^3$\n\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing. An eclipse can only occur if the observer's line of sight is very close to the orbital plane. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and `sin³(i) = 1`. We can therefore assume `sin³(i) ≈ 1` for both systems.\n\nLet's denote the total mass of system_1 as $M_{sys1}$ and the total mass of system_2 as $M_{sys2}$.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period, $P_1 = 2$ years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes, $K_{1,sum} = K_{1,1} + K_{1,2} = 10 \\text{ km/s} + 5 \\text{ km/s} = 15 \\text{ km/s}$\n\nThe mass of system 1 is:\n$M_{sys1} = \\frac{P_1}{2\\pi G} (K_{1,sum})^3 = \\frac{2 \\text{ years}}{2\\pi G} (15 \\text{ km/s})^3$\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period, $P_2 = 1$ year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes, $K_{2,sum} = K_{2,1} + K_{2,2} = 15 \\text{ km/s} + 10 \\text{ km/s} = 25 \\text{ km/s}$\n\nThe mass of system 2 is:\n$M_{sys2} = \\frac{P_2}{2\\pi G} (K_{2,sum})^3 = \\frac{1 \\text{ year}}{2\\pi G} (25 \\text{ km/s})^3$\n\n**Calculate the ratio**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio $M_{sys1} / M_{sys2}$.\n\n$\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = \\frac{\\frac{P_1}{2\\pi G} (K_{1,sum})^3}{\\frac{P_2}{2\\pi G} (K_{2,sum})^3}$\n\nThe term $\\frac{1}{2\\pi G}$ cancels out, and we are left with:\n\n$\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\left( \\frac{K_{1,sum}}{K_{2,sum}} \\right)^3$\n\nNow, substitute the values:\n\n$\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = \\frac{2 \\text{ years}}{1 \\text{ year}} \\left( \\frac{15 \\text{ km/s}}{25 \\text{ km/s}} \\right)^3$\n\n$\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{15}{25} \\right)^3 = 2 \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^3$\n\n$\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{27}{125} \\right) = \\frac{54}{125}$\n\n$\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = 0.432$\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
