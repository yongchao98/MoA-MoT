    "**Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n\n*   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n*   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction known as cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **Mechanism:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated to form the final product, a cyanohydrin, which has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitrile (-CN) group on the same carbon.\n*   **Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide a proton (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. While this reaction can be catalyzed by base, it is often performed by adding a mineral acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) after the initial addition of cyanide. The term H₃O⁺ represents an aqueous strong acid, which serves as the necessary proton source. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n*   **Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile functional group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions, usually with heat.\n*   **Reagent B:** Reagent B must be a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄. The nitrile is first converted to an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is not strong enough to effectively catalyze this hydrolysis to completion.\n    *   HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the suitable reagent for the first reaction (A) is H₃O⁺, and the suitable reagent for the second reaction (B) is HCl. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
