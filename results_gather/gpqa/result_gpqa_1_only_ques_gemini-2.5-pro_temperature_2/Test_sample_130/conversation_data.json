    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The description is for a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   The ¹H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region. A single peak for the alkene protons indicates they are chemically equivalent, suggesting a symmetrical molecule.\n        *   The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks: one at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and one at 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only one signal for each type of carbon further confirms the high symmetry.\n        *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). The two vinylic protons are equivalent due to a C₂v symmetry plane, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclopentadiene ring with a methyl group on each of the four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 position is a CH₂ group. The cyclic structure locks the diene in the *s-cis* conformation required for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. There are two possible stereoisomeric products, resulting from two different modes of approach: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   The **Alder Endo Rule** states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the major product typically arises from the *endo* approach. This approach is favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile (the carbonyls) and the π-system of the diene.\n    *   **Endo Approach:** The anhydride ring orients itself \"under\" the diene, on the same side as the forming C2=C3 double bond. In the resulting product, the fused anhydride ring is *anti* to the CH₂ bridge (the C5 carbon of the original diene). Consequently, the methine protons from the anhydride (let's call them **Ha**) are oriented towards the CH₂ bridge, placing them in the *endo* position of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. This is the **major product**.\n    *   **Exo Approach:** The anhydride ring orients itself \"away\" from the diene. In the resulting product, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. The anhydride protons (**Ha**) are in the *exo* position, pointing away from the CH₂ bridge and towards the C(Me)=C(Me) double bond. This is the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< ~5 Å). The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close only in the major (*endo*) isomer.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the key proton proximities in both isomers:\n        *   **Major Product (Ha are *endo*):** The *endo*-protons (**Ha**) point towards the CH₂ bridge. They are spatially close to the protons of the CH₂ bridge (specifically, the *anti*-proton relative to the C=C bond). They are far from the vinylic methyl groups on the other side of the molecule.\n        *   **Minor Product (Ha are *exo*):** The *exo*-protons (**Ha**) point away from the CH₂ bridge and towards the vinylic methyl groups. They are spatially far from the CH₂ bridge protons but close to the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n    *   Therefore, the NOE interaction unique to the major product is between the anhydride methine protons (**Ha**) and the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n4.  **Match with the NMR Data in the Options**\n\n    *   We need to find the option that describes an interaction between the anhydride methine protons (Ha) and a CH₂ bridge proton. Let's analyze the signals described in the options:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two anhydride methine protons (Ha) are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a singlet. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable for protons alpha to a carbonyl group in a strained ring.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically inequivalent. They will couple to each other (geminal coupling), so each should appear as a doublet (in the absence of further coupling). A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is appropriate for an aliphatic proton in a bicyclic system.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to one set of equivalent methyl groups. The chemical shift suggests the vinylic methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** This corresponds to the other set of methyl groups. The upfield shift suggests the bridgehead methyl groups on the saturated carbons.\n\n    *   Now let's evaluate the options based on our analysis:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, **Ha**). This interaction (vinylic methyls ↔ **Ha**) is strong in the *minor* product, not the major one.\n        *   B) A 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, **bridge proton**). This interaction should be present in both isomers to some extent.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and a 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm). This is an interaction between the two sets of methyl groups, which should be present in both isomers.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, **bridge proton**) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, **Ha**). This corresponds to the interaction between the CH₂ bridge protons and the anhydride methine protons. This interaction is strong in the **major product** and very weak or absent in the minor product.\n\nThis perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n<<<D>>>"
