    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum redshift ($z$) required to shift the Lyman-alpha absorption line from its rest-frame wavelength into the range detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n1.  **Rest-frame Wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Ly-$\\alpha$) transition for neutral hydrogen occurs at a rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Ground-Based Optical Window:** Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation. Ground-based telescopes can only detect light in the \"optical window,\" which starts at a wavelength of about 3200-3500 Å (320-350 nm) due to atmospheric absorption (primarily by ozone). For a robust detection, we often consider the lower limit of observability to be around 3500 Å.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The cosmological redshift ($z$) relates the rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) to the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) by the formula:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}}$\n\n4.  **Finding the Lower Limit:** We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift. This corresponds to the case where the Ly-$\\alpha$ line is shifted to the shortest possible observable wavelength, which is the blue/UV edge of the ground-based optical window. Let's use an approximate value of $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}} \\approx 3500$ Å for this cutoff.\n\n    Plugging the values into the redshift formula:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} \\approx 2.88$\n\n    Solving for z:\n    $z \\approx 2.88 - 1 = 1.88$\n\n5.  **Comparing with Options:** This calculated value of $z \\approx 1.88$ is very close to the option A) 1.9.\n\n    Let's check what observed wavelength a redshift of 1.9 would correspond to:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z) = 1216 \\text{ Å} \\times (1 + 1.9) = 1216 \\text{ Å} \\times 2.9 = 3526.4$ Å.\n\n    This wavelength (352.6 nm) is right at the blue edge of the atmospheric optical window, making $z=1.9$ a very good estimate for the lower limit. A redshift lower than this (like option C) would result in an observed wavelength that is still in the ultraviolet and blocked by the atmosphere. Redshifts higher than this (like options B and D) would be detectable, but they don't represent the *lower limit*.\n\n<<<A>>>"
