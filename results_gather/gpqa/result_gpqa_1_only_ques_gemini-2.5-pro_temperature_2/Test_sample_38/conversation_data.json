    "To find the numerical value of the constant \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nWhere the integral is taken over all space where the particle has a non-zero probability of being found.\n\n**Step 1: Define the integration limits and the probability density function |Ψ(x)|²**\n\nThe problem states that particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. This means our limits of integration are from 1 to 3.\n\nThe wave function Ψ(x) is given as:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThis is a complex number of the form (Real Part) + i*(Imaginary Part).\nReal Part = a / sqrt(1 + x)\nImaginary Part = -0.5\n\nThe squared modulus, |Ψ(x)|², is calculated as (Real Part)² + (Imaginary Part)²:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ]² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThis |Ψ(x)|² is the probability density function.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the normalization integral**\n\nWe now integrate the probability density function from x=1 to x=3 and set the result equal to 1:\n∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1\n\n**Step 3: Solve the integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx + ∫₁³ [ 0.25 ] dx = 1\n\nLet's solve each part:\n1.  ∫ a² / (1 + x) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\n2.  ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * x\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ] from 1 to 3 = 1\n[ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ] = 1\n[ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ] = 1\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \"a\"**\n\nSimplify the equation:\na² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nNow, we use the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na = sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is closest to the option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
