    "A molecule will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters, but the molecule must lack an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond, but it has no stereocenters (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the double bond).\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The IUPAC name includes specific stereodescriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n    *   A name that specifies a single stereoisomer with `R` or `S` descriptors, like this one, refers to a specific enantiomer or diastereomer.\n    *   The parent skeleton may have symmetry, but the presence of the `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` substituent (`>C=CHCl`) is unsymmetrical and will break any pre-existing plane of symmetry.\n    *   A specific, non-meso stereoisomer is by definition chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The designation is `(2R,3S)`, meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. In a molecule with a symmetrical structure like this one, this often indicates a meso compound.\n    *   Indeed, if we draw the molecule in a conformation with the two carboxyl groups antiperiplanar, we can see a center of inversion. Alternatively, a Fischer projection reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral due to internal symmetry, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. Both stereocenters have the same `(R)` configuration.\n    *   The mirror image of the `(2R,3R)` isomer is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. They are non-superimposable.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral compound and exists as a pair of enantiomers (`RR` and `SS`). The specified `(2R,3R)` isomer is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group. The carbon atom bearing the -OH group (C1) is a stereocenter. It's bonded to -OH, -H, and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH2-` vs `-CH=CH-CH2-`).\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This notation most likely refers to the all-`cis` isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This isomer is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true stereocenters because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical.\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name indicates a butan-1-one parent chain, meaning a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. The other group on the ketone is specified as `1-cyclopentyl`. A methyl group is on C3.\n    *   The structure is `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This can also be seen as `cyclopentyl 3-methylbutanoyl ketone`. Let's analyze the structure for stereocenters.\n    *   Let's check C3 of the butanoyl chain. It is bonded to a hydrogen (`H`), a methyl group (`CH3`, which is C4), another methyl group (`CH3`, the substituent), and the rest of the chain (`-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`). This reasoning is flawed because a carbon cannot have 5 bonds.\n    *   Let's correctly deduce the structure from the name \"3-methylbutanoyl\". This is derived from 3-methylbutanoic acid, which is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-COOH`.\n    *   So, the ketone's structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's examine this structure for stereocenters. The `CH` carbon is bonded to one `H`, two identical `CH3` groups, and a `-CH2-` group. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
