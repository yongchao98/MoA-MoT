    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Shape:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where the apothem (the distance from the center to the midpoint of any side) is 'a'. We are asked to consider the case where N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    As N approaches infinity, a regular N-sided polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture (Airy Pattern):**\n    When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. The intensity distribution in this pattern is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n    Where:\n    *   `I₀` is the intensity at the center.\n    *   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n3.  **Locating the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur at angles `θ` where the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0`. Let's define the argument of the Bessel function as `z = k * a * sinθ`. The minima correspond to the zeros of `J₁(z)`.\n    From mathematical tables, the first few non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function `J₁(z)` are:\n    *   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317` (This corresponds to the first minimum)\n    *   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156` (This corresponds to the second minimum)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    The condition for the m-th minimum is `k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`.\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ`, we get:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\n    `sin(θₘ) = (zₘ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n    The problem states we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. So:\n    `θₘ ≈ (zₘ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n    *   **Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n        `θ₁ ≈ (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n\n    *   **Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n        `θ₂ ≈ (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    The angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions, Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value `0.5068 λ / a` is very close to option B. The minor difference is due to rounding of the values for the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\n    *   A) 1.220 λ /a (Incorrect. This would be `2 * θ₁` or `1.22λ / D` where D=diameter=`a`, which isn't right).\n    *   B) 0.506 λ / a (Matches our calculation).\n    *   C) 0.500 λ / a (Incorrect).\n    *   D) 0.610 λ / a (Incorrect. This is the approximate angular position `θ₁` of the first minimum, not the distance between the first and second minima).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
