    "To solve this problem, we need to find the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$) when it collides with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon. The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\nThis process is governed by the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for this reaction to occur. This happens when the final products (the electron and positron) are created with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame.\n\nLet's define our variables:\n*   $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray. This is what we need to find.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon, given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n*   $m_e$ is the rest mass of an electron (and a positron). The rest mass energy is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nThe key physical principle is the invariance of the total four-momentum squared, $s = (E_{total}/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}_{total}|^2$, which is the same in all inertial reference frames.\n\n**1. In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame at Threshold:**\nAt the threshold of the reaction, the electron and positron are created at rest.\n*   Total energy in the CM frame: $E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n*   Total momentum in the CM frame: $\\vec{p}_{CM} = 0$.\n*   The invariant mass squared is $s = (E_{CM}/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}_{CM}|^2 = (2m_e c^2/c)^2 - 0 = (2 m_e c)^2$.\n\n**2. In the Lab Frame:**\nWe consider the collision in the reference frame of the universe (the lab frame).\n*   The high-energy photon has four-momentum $P_{\\gamma} = (E_{\\gamma}/c, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$.\n*   The CMB photon has four-momentum $P_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n*   The total four-momentum is $P_{total} = P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB}$.\n*   The invariant mass squared is $s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$.\n\nFor any photon, its four-momentum squared is zero ($P^2 = (E/c)^2 - p^2 = 0$ since $E=pc$). Therefore, $P_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\nThe invariant simplifies to:\n$s = 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = 2 \\left(\\frac{E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}\\right)$\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle between the momenta of the two photons. Then $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = \\frac{E_{\\gamma}}{c} \\frac{E_{CMB}}{c} \\cos\\theta$.\nSo, $s = 2 \\frac{E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**3. Equating the expressions for s:**\nWe equate the value of $s$ from the CM frame and the lab frame.\n$(2m_e c)^2 = 2 \\frac{E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$4m_e^2 c^2 = 2 \\frac{E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$2(m_e c^2)^2 = E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**4. Finding the Threshold Energy:**\nTo find the minimum possible energy $E_{\\gamma}$ for this reaction to occur (the threshold energy), we need to find the condition that makes the interaction most efficient. From the equation above, $E_{\\gamma}$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. The maximum value is $1 - (-1) = 2$, which occurs when $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$ (a head-on collision).\n\nSubstituting $\\cos\\theta = -1$, the threshold condition becomes:\n$2(m_e c^2)^2 = E_{\\gamma, th} E_{CMB}(2)$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**5. Calculation:**\nNow we plug in the given values:\n*   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
