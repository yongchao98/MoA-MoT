    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory (Southern Hemisphere) and the Keck Observatory (Northern Hemisphere).\n2.  **Magnitude:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be bright enough for both instruments. This means it must be brighter than the stricter limit of the two, which is `V < 16` mag (for HIRES).\n\n### Step 1: Establish Visibility Constraints\n\n*   The Keck Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately +20° N. It can observe stars with declinations roughly between -70° and +90°.\n*   The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24° S. It can observe stars with declinations roughly between -90° and +66°.\n*   For a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination (DEC) must be within the overlapping range, which is approximately **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Magnitude Constraint\n\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent `V < 17`.\n*   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent `V < 16`.\n*   To be observed by **both**, a star must satisfy the more stringent condition: **`V < 16` mag**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (V) from the absolute magnitude (Mv) and distance (d, in parsecs), including interstellar absorption (Av) where necessary:\n`V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + Av`\nThe absorption is calculated as `Av = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n**Star1**\n*   **DEC:** -75°. This is not within the shared visibility range (-70° < DEC < +66°), as it is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star2**\n*   **DEC:** +55°. This is within the shared visibility range.\n*   **Magnitude:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag.\n*   Check: Is `16.5 < 16`? No. The star is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star3**\n*   **DEC:** +48°. This is within the shared visibility range.\n*   **Magnitude:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. (The E(B-V) information is extraneous as the final apparent magnitude is already provided).\n*   Check: Is `15.5 < 16`? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n**Star4**\n*   **DEC:** -48°. This is within the shared visibility range.\n*   **Magnitude:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Mv = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n    *   Absorption `Av = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n*   Check: Is `16.74 < 16`? No. The star is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star5**\n*   **DEC:** +60°. This is within the shared visibility range.\n*   **Magnitude:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Mv = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   Absorption Av = 0 (not mentioned).\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995` mag.\n*   Check: Is `14.995 < 16`? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n### Summary\n\nThe stars that satisfy both the visibility and magnitude requirements for both observatories are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
