    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, where the observer is at rest. The glass is observed to be moving at a velocity `v`.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the rest frame of the glass. In this frame, the glass is stationary.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the lab frame (S). The problem states the glass moves in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass frame (S'). This is the speed of light *inside* the glass. By the definition of the index of refraction `n`, this speed is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, we have `u' = 1/n`. The direction is the same as the motion of the glass.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the lab frame (S). This is the quantity we want to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To clear the fractions, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
