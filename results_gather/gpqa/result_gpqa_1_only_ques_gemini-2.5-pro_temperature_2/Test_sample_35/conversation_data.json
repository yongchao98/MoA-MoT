    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the effect of cosmological distance:** The observed structure is at a distance of 2.1 Gpc. Light from such a distant object is stretched by the expansion of the universe, a phenomenon known as redshift (z). Redshift causes the observed energy of the light to be lower than the energy at which it was emitted.\n\n2.  **Calculate the redshift (z):** We can estimate the redshift using the Hubble-Lemaître law and the energy of the 21-cm line. The key is to recognize what the absorption line is. The question is a bit of a reverse problem. Let's assume the most common low-energy absorption line and see if the numbers match. The most famous radio absorption line is the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen.\n    *   The rest-frame energy (the energy of the transition if it happened in our lab or in the Milky Way) of the 21-cm line is approximately 5.87 micro-electron volts (5.87 x 10⁻⁶ eV).\n    *   The relationship between observed energy (E_obs), rest-frame energy (E_rest), and redshift (z) is: E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n    *   We can calculate the redshift of the absorbing gas:\n        1 + z = E_rest / E_obs\n        1 + z = (5.87 x 10⁻⁶ eV) / (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV)\n        1 + z ≈ 1.505\n        z ≈ 0.505\n\n3.  **Verify the distance:** Using standard cosmological models (like the Lambda-CDM model), a redshift of z ≈ 0.5 corresponds to a comoving distance of approximately 2.1-2.2 Gpc. The given distance of 2.1 Gpc is fully consistent with this redshift. This confirms our initial assumption that the observed line is a redshifted 21-cm hydrogen line.\n\n4.  **Identify the source of the line:** The 21-cm line is a result of a spin-flip transition in the ground state of neutral **atomic hydrogen (HI)**. Therefore, the absorption is caused by the atomic interstellar medium.\n\n5.  **Determine the temperature of the medium:** The problem states this is an **absorption** line. For an absorption line to be seen, the gas cloud must be in front of a brighter, background source (like the distant galaxy or quasar being observed). The gas must also be colder than the background source's radio emission at that frequency. This means we are observing a **cold** cloud of gas. The warm phase of the atomic medium is typically seen in emission, not absorption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation is of a redshifted 21-cm line from neutral atomic hydrogen. In the Milky Way (i.e., at its rest-frame energy), this line is the primary tracer of the atomic interstellar medium. Since it is observed in absorption, it must be from the **cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
