    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure of the reactant\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the parent ring, a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), located at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nLet's draw the structure based on this information:\n```\n      COOH (at C1)\n     /    \\\n  H-C(2)--C(6)-H₂\n    |      |\n  H-C(3)==C(4)-H\n    \\      /\n     C(5)-H\n     |\n     CH=CH₂ (vinyl group)\n```\nLet's attach the formyl group at C2:\n```\n      COOH (at C1)\n     /    \\\nCHO-C(2)--C(6)-H₂\n    |      |\n  H-C(3)==C(4)-H\n    \\      /\n     C(5)-H\n     |\n     CH=CH₂ (vinyl group)\n```\nFor clarity, let's write out the molecular formula and calculate the initial IHD.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 1 at C1, 1 at C2, 1 at C3, 1 at C4, 1 at C5, 2 at C6, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 3 in vinyl = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the structure:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the ring.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\nTotal IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the reaction\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   The ring structure itself is not opened by this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of the product\n\nApplying the reductions to our reactant:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** at C1 is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** at C2 is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring** is reduced to a single bond, making the ring a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The **double bond in the vinyl group** is reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) into an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nThe final product will be a substituted cyclohexane. All double bonds will be gone, and all oxygen atoms will be removed. The carbon skeleton will consist of a 6-membered ring, two methyl groups, and one ethyl group. The product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane** (the numbering might change based on IUPAC rules for alkanes, but the connectivity remains).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product\n\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane. Let's find its IHD.\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Number of rings:** The product still contains the six-membered ring, so there is **1 ring**.\n*   **Number of π bonds:** All C=C and C=O double bonds have been reduced to single bonds. Therefore, there are **0 π bonds**.\n\nThe IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product and calculate the IHD from that.\nThe product has 10 carbon atoms (same as the reactant).\nThe general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\nFor n=10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\nThe IHD formula is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\nFor C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 3\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
