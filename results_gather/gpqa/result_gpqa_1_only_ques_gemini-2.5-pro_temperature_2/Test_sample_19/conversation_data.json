    "The impulse approximation is a fundamental concept in nuclear physics used to simplify the calculation of interactions between an external probe (like an electron, neutrino, or photon) and a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction happens with a single nucleon inside the nucleus, and this interaction occurs so quickly that the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, momentarily unaffected by the other nucleons or the nuclear potential.\n\nLet's break down the given assumptions in this context:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the primary tenet of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the probe interacts with a single nucleon at a time, rather than with the nucleus as a whole or with multi-nucleon clusters. This is often called the \"one-body current approximation.\" This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This means that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not interact with the other nucleons on their way in or out. This is a crucial simplifying assumption that isolates the primary interaction. Without it, one would need to account for complex \"final state interactions\" (or initial state interactions), which would violate the simple picture of the nucleon behaving like a free particle. This is a key component of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA).\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is about the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus*. The impulse approximation can be and is applied in high-energy scattering experiments (like deep inelastic scattering) where the quarks are highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a general requirement for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. It posits that the interaction is instantaneous on the timescale of nuclear motion. During this brief moment, the potential energy from the surrounding nucleons is negligible compared to the large energy and momentum transfer of the interaction. Thus, the nucleon's dynamics during the collision are governed by its free-particle properties. This is essential to the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation are that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), this nucleon acts as if it's free from its binding potential during the interaction (4), and there are no further interactions with the rest of the nucleus (2). Assumption (3) is an independent physical consideration regarding the nucleon's internal structure, not a prerequisite for the impulse approximation itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
