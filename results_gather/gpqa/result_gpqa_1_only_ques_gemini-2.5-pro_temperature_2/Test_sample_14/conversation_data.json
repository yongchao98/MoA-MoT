    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 (P_tr_1) with that of Planet_2 (P_tr_2) and find the ratio between them.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the probability of it transiting its host star (i.e., its orbital plane being aligned with our line of sight) is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_star) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n    *   P_tr = R_star / a\n\n3.  **Relate the Semi-major Axis (a) to Known Quantities:** We don't have the semi-major axis directly, but we can find it using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star (a valid assumption for \"Earth-like\" planets), the law is:\n    *   P² ≈ (4π² / G * M_star) * a³\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   M_star is the mass of the host star.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Solve for 'a':**\n    *   a³ ≈ (G * M_star * P²) / 4π²\n    *   a ≈ [ (G * M_star * P²) / 4π² ]^(1/3)\n    This shows that `a` is proportional to `(M_star * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\n5.  **Express Transit Probability in Terms of Given Variables:** Now, substitute this expression for 'a' back into the transit probability formula:\n    *   P_tr ≈ R_star / [ (G * M_star * P²) / 4π² ]^(1/3)\n    Since G and 4π² are constants, the probability is proportional to:\n    *   P_tr ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n    *   P_tr ∝ R_star / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(2/3))\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of P_tr_1 to P_tr_2:\n    *   Ratio = P_tr_1 / P_tr_2 = [ R_s1 / (M_s1^(1/3) * P_1^(2/3)) ] / [ R_s2 / (M_s2^(1/3) * P_2^(2/3)) ]\n    *   Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute the Given Information:**\n    *   Host stars have the same radii: R_s1 = R_s2  =>  (R_s1 / R_s2) = 1\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2  =>  (M_s2 / M_s1) = 1/2\n    *   The period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2: P_2 = 3 * P_1  =>  (P_2 / P_1) = 3\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value of the Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)\n    *   Ratio = (3²)^(1/3) / (2)^(1/3)\n    *   Ratio = (9)^(1/3) / (2)^(1/3)\n    *   Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\n    *   Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)\n    *   Ratio ≈ 1.65096...\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2 is approximately 1.65. This means Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting its host star than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
