    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state of a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\nWe can solve this problem by considering the system as three independent 1D quantum harmonic oscillators, one for each Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z). The potential can be written as $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\nFor the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nNow, let's find the energy and degeneracy for the first few states:\n\n1.  **Ground State (N=0):**\n    *   This corresponds to the lowest energy level.\n    *   $N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0$. The only possible combination is $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   Degeneracy: There is only 1 state, so the degeneracy is 1.\n\n2.  **First Excited State (N=1):**\n    *   $N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 1$. The possible combinations are $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 1)$.\n    *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   Degeneracy: There are 3 different combinations of quantum numbers that yield the same energy, so the degeneracy is 3.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State (N=2):**\n    *   $N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$. The possible combinations are:\n        *   $(2, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2)$ (3 states)\n        *   $(1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1)$ (3 states)\n    *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   Degeneracy: The total number of states is $3 + 3 = 6$.\n\n4.  **Third Excited State (N=3):**\n    *   This is the state we are interested in.\n    *   $N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. The possible combinations are:\n        *   One number is 3, others are 0: $(3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)$ (3 states)\n        *   One number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: $(2, 1, 0)$ and its permutations, which are $(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2)$ (6 states)\n        *   All numbers are 1: $(1, 1, 1)$ (1 state)\n    *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   Degeneracy: The total number of states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe degeneracy can also be calculated using the general formula for the degeneracy of the N-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, which is $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For N=3, the degeneracy is $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option C.\n\nThe expressions in options B and D involving $1/r^2$ are characteristic of the energy levels for a particle in a spherical box (infinite potential well), not a harmonic oscillator.\n\nFinal answer:\nEnergy: $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\nNumber of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy): 10\n\n<<<C>>>"
