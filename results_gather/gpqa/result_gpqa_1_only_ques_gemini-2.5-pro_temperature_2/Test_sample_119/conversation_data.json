    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship.\n\n1.  **Assumption:** We assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (n), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of stars in a volume:** The number of stars (N) in a given volume (V) is simply N = n * V.\n\n3.  **Consider a thin spherical shell:** Let's count the number of stars (dN) at a distance between `d` and `d + dd` from us. These stars occupy a thin spherical shell. The volume of this shell (dV) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d`: 4πd²\n    *   Thickness of the shell: `dd`\n    *   Volume of the shell (dV): dV ≈ 4πd² * dd\n\n4.  **Number of stars in the shell:** The number of stars (dN) in this shell is the density (n) times the volume of the shell (dV).\n    *   dN = n * dV = n * (4πd² * dd)\n\n5.  **Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance.\n    *   plx = 1/d\n    *   This also means d = 1/plx\n\n6.  **Relate the infinitesimal changes `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to express `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   So, `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n7.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN`:** Now we replace `d` and `dd` in our equation `dN = 4πn * d² * dd` with their parallax equivalents.\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`: dN = 4πn * (1/plx)² * dd\n    *   Replace `dd` with `(1/plx²) * d(plx)`: dN = 4πn * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n\n8.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   dN = 4πn * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n9.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   dN/d(plx) = 4πn * (1/plx⁴)\n\n10. **Final relationship:** Since `4πn` is a constant (based on our initial assumption of uniform density), we can see the relationship:\n    *   The number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
