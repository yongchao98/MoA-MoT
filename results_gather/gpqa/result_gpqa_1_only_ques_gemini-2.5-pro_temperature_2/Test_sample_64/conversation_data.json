    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Reactant Structure and Reagents:**\n    *   The reactant is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The IUPAC name describes a spirocyclic compound made of a cyclobutane ring and a cyclohexane ring sharing a spiro carbon (C4).\n        *   The cyclobutane ring is numbered C1, C2, C3.\n        *   The cyclohexane ring is numbered C5, C6, C7, C8, C9.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) are on C1.\n        *   A double bond is present between C5 and C6 in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The reagents are Potassium Hydride (KH) in Tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by an acidic workup (H⁺). KH is a very strong, non-nucleophilic base.\n\n2.  **Proposed Mechanism: Anionic Oxy-Cope Rearrangement**\n    *   The structure of the reactant, which is a 1,5-dien-3-ol derivative, is perfectly set up for an Oxy-Cope rearrangement. The sequence of reagents confirms this path.\n    *   **Step 1: Deprotonation.** KH deprotonates the hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a potassium alkoxide (-O⁻K⁺). The presence of the negative charge on the oxygen dramatically accelerates the subsequent rearrangement (anionic Oxy-Cope).\n    *   **Step 2: [3,3]-Sigmatropic Rearrangement.** The alkoxide undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Let's identify the six-atom chain involved:\n        *   CH₂=CH(vinyl) – C1(ring, with O⁻) – C4(spiro) – C5(ring) = C6(ring)\n        *   This is a 1,5-diene system with an alkoxide at the C3 position.\n    *   **Bond Changes:**\n        *   The σ-bond between C1 and C4 (a bond of the cyclobutane ring) breaks.\n        *   A new σ-bond forms between the terminal carbon of the vinyl group (let's call it C1') and C6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The π-bonds shift: the vinyl π-bond moves between the internal vinyl carbon and C1, and the C5=C6 π-bond moves between C4 and C5.\n    *   **Step 3: Tautomerization.** The rearrangement initially produces an enolate. The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the enolate, which then tautomerizes to the more stable ketone.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    *   Let's trace the atoms to determine the new carbon skeleton. Breaking the C1-C4 bond opens the 4-membered ring. The new C1'-C6 bond creates a bicyclic (bridged) system.\n    *   The two bridgehead carbons are the original C4 and C6.\n    *   Let's count the atoms in the bridges between these two bridgeheads:\n        1.  The path through the original cyclohexane ring: -C7-C8-C9- (3 carbons).\n        2.  The path through the opened cyclobutane and vinyl chain: -C1-C2-C3- and -CH(vinyl)-CH₂(vinyl)-. The connection is C4-C3-C2-C1-CH(vinyl)-CH₂(vinyl)-C6. This path is -C3-C2-C1-CH(vinyl)-CH₂(vinyl)- (5 carbons).\n        3.  The atom C5, now bonded to C4 and C6, with a new double bond between C4 and C5, forms a 1-carbon bridge.\n    *   The resulting skeleton is a **bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane**.\n    *   The ketone (C=O) forms at the original C1 position.\n    *   A double bond is located at the original C4=C5 position.\n    *   By applying IUPAC numbering rules to this new bicyclic system, the product is named **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**. The double bond is between a bridgehead (C1) and the single-atom bridge (C11), and the ketone is at C4.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol (CH₃CH₂CH=CHCH₂OH), an E-configured allylic alcohol.\n    *   Reagents: Acetyl bromide (CH₃COBr) and Lithium Diisopropylamide (LDA), a strong, bulky base.\n\n2.  **Proposed Mechanism: Ireland-Claisen Rearrangement**\n    *   This combination of reagents acting on an allylic alcohol is characteristic of the Ireland-Claisen rearrangement.\n    *   **Step 1: O-acylation.** The reaction sequence involves the formation of an allyl ester intermediate. LDA first deprotonates the alcohol to form a lithium alkoxide. This alkoxide then attacks acetyl bromide to form (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate.\n        `CH₃CH₂CH=CHCH₂OH + LDA → CH₃CH₂CH=CHCH₂O⁻Li⁺`\n        `CH₃CH₂CH=CHCH₂O⁻Li⁺ + CH₃COBr → CH₃CH₂CH=CHCH₂OCOCH₃ + LiBr`\n    *   **Step 2: Enolate formation.** The reaction mixture still contains a strong base (LDA), which deprotonates the α-carbon of the acetate group to form a lithium ester enolate (a key intermediate for the Ireland-Claisen rearrangement).\n        `CH₃CH₂CH=CHCH₂OCOCH₃ + LDA → [CH₃CH₂CH=CHCH₂-O-C(O⁻Li⁺)=CH₂] + Diisopropylamine`\n    *   **Step 3: [3,3]-Sigmatropic Rearrangement.** The lithium ester enolate undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement via a chair-like transition state.\n        *   The O-CH₂(allyl) bond breaks.\n        *   A new C-C bond forms between the terminal CH₂ of the enolate and the terminal CH of the pentenyl double bond (the carbon bearing the ethyl group).\n    *   **Step 4: Product Formation.** The rearrangement directly yields a lithium carboxylate.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   Let's trace the formation of the product chain.\n    *   The new C-C bond connects the α-carbon of the original acetate moiety to the γ-carbon of the original allyl moiety.\n    *   The product chain is: `(from acetate)H₂C–CH(Ethyl)–(from allyl)CH=CH₂(original allyl π-bond moves here)` attached to a carboxylate group `–COO⁻Li⁺`.\n    *   Assembling the full structure gives: `Li⁺ ⁻OOC–CH₂–CH(CH₂CH₃)–CH=CH₂`.\n    *   The name of the corresponding carboxylic acid (after an acidic workup) is 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid.\n    *   Since the problem statement does **not** specify an acidic workup for this reaction, the final product exists as the lithium salt.\n    *   Therefore, product B is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product **A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n*   Product **B** is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
