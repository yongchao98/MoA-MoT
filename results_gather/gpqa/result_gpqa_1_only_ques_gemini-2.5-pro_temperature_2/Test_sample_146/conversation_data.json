    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1. Understand the initial state and its energy**\n\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a \"slowly moving\" antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). In particle physics, \"slowly moving\" implies that the particle's kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can approximate the initial system as being at rest.\n\nThe total energy of the initial system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest energy of a proton is a standard value:\n$m_p c^2 = m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is:\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Apply the principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe initial energy is converted into the total energy of the final particles. The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy:\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Determine the energy of a single final particle**\n\nThe total final energy is shared among the four resulting particles. Since the initial system was at rest and the four final particles have the same mass, by symmetry, we can assume that the energy is distributed equally among them.\nThe energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Use the relativistic energy formula to find the velocity**\n\nThe total energy ($E$) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m c^2$\nwhere $m c^2$ is the rest energy and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nFor particle A, we have:\nTotal energy, $E_A = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\nRest energy, $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$ (given)\n\nWe can now calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n**5. Solve for the velocity (v)**\n\nNow we solve for $v$ using the definition of the Lorentz factor:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\nLet $\\beta = v/c$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4439}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092} = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7686$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7686c$.\n\n**6. Compare with the options**\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This corresponds to option D.\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.77c\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
