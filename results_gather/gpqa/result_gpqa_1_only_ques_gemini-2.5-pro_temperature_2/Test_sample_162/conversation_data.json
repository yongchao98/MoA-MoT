    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum volume of a strong acid needed to dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ is an equilibrium process:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nThis solid is very sparingly soluble, with a solubility product constant (Ksp) at 25°C of approximately Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 4.0 x 10⁻³⁸.\n\nTo dissolve it, we add a strong acid (source of H⁺ ions). The H⁺ ions react with the OH⁻ ions, removing them from the solution:\nH⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\nThis second reaction pulls the first equilibrium to the right (Le Chatelier's Principle), allowing more Fe(OH)₃ to dissolve. The overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate Moles and Concentrations**\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol.\n\n*   **Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   The problem states the final volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = moles / volume = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\n**3. Determine the Minimum Acidity (Maximum pH) for Dissolution**\n\nFor all the Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved and remain in solution, the ion product, Qsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³, must be less than or equal to Ksp. The \"minimum\" condition corresponds to Qsp = Ksp.\n\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   4.0 x 10⁻³⁸ = (0.009356) * [OH⁻]³\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (4.0 x 10⁻³⁸) / 0.009356 = 4.276 x 10⁻³⁶\n*   [OH⁻] = (4.276 x 10⁻³⁶)¹/³ = 1.623 x 10⁻¹² M\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding pOH and pH.\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(1.623 x 10⁻¹²) = 11.79\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 11.79 = 2.21\n\nThis means the final pH of the solution must be **pH ≤ 2.21** to prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's look at the pH values given in the options:\n*   A) pH 4.94\n*   B) pH 3.16\n*   C) pH 2.69\n*   D) pH 2.04\n\nComparing these to our calculated requirement (pH ≤ 2.21):\n*   Options A, B, and C have pH values that are too high. At these pH levels, Fe(OH)₃ would precipitate out of the solution, and it would not be fully dissolved as the problem requires.\n*   Option D has a pH of 2.04, which is less than 2.21. This is the only pH at which the solution can be prepared and remain stable.\n\nTherefore, option D must be the correct answer based on the thermodynamic requirement for dissolution.\n\n**5. Verification of the Volume (for completeness)**\n\nAlthough we have identified the correct option based on the pH, let's briefly check the volume calculation. This problem is complex because of the subsequent hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. A full calculation is complicated, but a simplified one demonstrates the issue.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ to react:** From the overall reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (consumed) = 3 * 0.0009356 mol = 0.002807 mol.\n*   **Volume to supply these moles:**\n    *   Volume = moles / concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis is very close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option D. The small difference arises from rounding of molar masses. This volume only accounts for the acid consumed in the reaction. It doesn't account for the excess acid needed to lower the pH to 2.04, nor the acid produced by Fe³⁺ hydrolysis. The fact that the provided volume is the stoichiometric one and the pH is significantly acidic points to an inconsistency in the problem's values. However, as established in step 4, option D is the only chemically plausible scenario.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the required pH to keep the iron(III) hydroxide dissolved, only option D represents a stable final solution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
