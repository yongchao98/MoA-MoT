    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of Product 3 and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane is a tricyclic (3 rings) saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong, characteristic absorption for a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Product 1:** Based on the ¹H NMR integration, the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C₁₀H₁₄O, the DoU = (2*C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 8/2 = 4.\n*   **Structural Interpretation:** The adamantane skeleton itself has 3 rings, which accounts for 3 degrees of unsaturation. The ketone (C=O) group accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation. Total DoU = 3 (rings) + 1 (C=O) = 4. This matches the calculation from the formula. Therefore, Product 1 is a tricyclic ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. It is an isomer of adamantanone. The unusually simple NMR spectrum and the highly deshielded signal at 4.79 ppm suggest a rearranged and highly symmetric structure, but we can proceed without knowing its exact identity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Chemistry:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). The formula becomes C₁₀H₁₆O. Product 2 is a tricyclic alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Chemistry - The Key Insight:** Ozonolysis is famous for cleaving carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). However, we established from the formula that Product 1 (and thus Product 2) does not contain a C=C bond. This appears to be a contradiction.\n*   The resolution is that ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent and can perform other reactions. In this context, treating a secondary alcohol (Product 2) with an oxidizing agent like ozone will oxidize it. The DMS serves to work up the reaction. The result of oxidizing the secondary alcohol in Product 2 is the formation of a ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The oxidation of the alcohol group (CH-OH) in Product 2 regenerates the ketone (C=O). Therefore, **Product 3 is identical to Product 1**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3**\n\n*   Since Product 3 is identical to Product 1, we must analyze the NMR spectrum of Product 1: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** Excluding any potential exchangeable protons (like an -OH, which isn't present anyway), the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent protons that give the signal at 4.79 ppm.\n*   **The Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern (multiplicity) of this signal. While the exact structure of Product 1 is a complex academic point (it's likely a rearranged adamantane isomer), we can deduce the coupling from general principles and the options provided.\n    *   A proton in a rigid polycyclic system like this is coupled to its neighbors. The signal is for two equivalent protons, so we are considering the coupling of one of these protons.\n    *   Let's consider the environment of a proton that is alpha to a ketone in an adamantane-like structure. It is often at a bridgehead (a CH group). This CH group is typically bonded to two other CH₂ groups (since the third direction is the ketone).\n    *   Therefore, this single proton is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons (two on each adjacent CH₂ group).\n    *   In a rigid system, these four neighbors are not equivalent. The coupling will depend on the specific dihedral angles (Karplus relationship). The true splitting pattern would be a complex multiplet, often a doublet of doublets of doublets of doublets (dddd).\n    *   However, among the given choices, a \"triplet of triplets\" is the best description for a proton coupled to two distinct pairs of protons. This often arises in cyclohexane-like rings where a proton is coupled to two different adjacent CH₂ groups. This pattern is frequently used to approximate or describe the complex splitting of protons in such rigid polycyclic environments.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n*   A) Pentet: Requires coupling to four *equivalent* protons, which is unlikely given the different electronic environments and geometries in a substituted cage.\n*   D) Triplet: Requires coupling to only two equivalent protons. This is too simple for the expected environment.\n*   B) Doublet of triplets: Requires coupling to one proton and a set of two protons. Our model environment has a proton coupled to two sets of two protons.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate description for the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
