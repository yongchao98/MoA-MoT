    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is in the region for a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond. A carboxylic acid has **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for **vinyl-hydrogens** confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n4.  **Putting it all Together and Evaluating Options:**\n    *   The evidence from all three techniques strongly indicates the presence of both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and a **C=C double bond**.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   We are left with A (C₆H₁₂O₂) and C (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n    *   Now let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        *   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Our analysis determined the compound must have a C=O double bond (part of the carboxylic acid) and a C=C double bond. This requires a total of two pi bonds, meaning the **Degree of Unsaturation must be 2**.\n    *   Only the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option C) has a DoU of 2. The formula C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A) has a DoU of 1, which is insufficient to accommodate both a carbonyl and an alkene group.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the spectral data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
