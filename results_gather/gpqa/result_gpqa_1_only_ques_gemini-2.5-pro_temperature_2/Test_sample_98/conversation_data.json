    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is broad due to the varying strengths of these hydrogen bonds. This peak often overlaps with C-H stretching absorptions.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid carbonyl group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThis is the key to differentiating between the isomeric structures. We are looking for a molecule that has two specific signals:\n1.  One signal that is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n2.  Another signal that is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nLet's break down what these splitting patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons, using the n+1 rule for splitting:\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (1H).\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to three equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n\nSo, we are looking for:\n*   A proton for the **dtq** signal: It must be adjacent to one CH group (gives the doublet), one CH₂ group (gives the triplet), and one CH₃ group (gives the quartet). Total neighbors = 1H + 2H + 3H = 6 protons in three distinct groups.\n*   A proton for the **dtt** signal: It must be adjacent to one CH group (gives the doublet), a CH₂ group (gives the first triplet), and another different CH₂ group (gives the second triplet). Total neighbors = 1H + 2H + 2H = 5 protons in three distinct groups.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the four possible structures.\n\n---\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n          CH₃(f)\n          |\nCH₃CH₂ -- CH(c) -- CH(d) -- COOH\n          |\n          CH₃(g)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to the CH₂(b) of the ethyl group (2H, gives a triplet), the CH₃(g) substituent (3H, gives a quartet), and the H(d) proton (1H, gives a doublet). This proton would show a **dtq** signal.\n*   **Proton H(d):** Is adjacent to the H(c) proton (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH₃(f) substituent (3H, gives a quartet). This proton gives a **dq** signal.\n*   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH and two CH₂ groups.\n*Conclusion: Molecule B has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal.*\n\n---\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n          CH₂CH₃(f)\n          |\nCH₃CH₂ -- CH(c) -- CH(d) -- COOH\n          |\n          CH₂CH₃(g)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to the CH₂(b) of the starting ethyl chain (2H, gives a triplet), the CH₂(g) of the ethyl substituent (2H, gives a triplet), and the H(d) proton (1H, gives a doublet). This proton would show a **dtt** signal.\n*   **Proton H(d):** Is adjacent to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the CH₂(f) of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt** signal.\n*   Protons in the methylene (CH₂) groups of the ethyls would be `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets).\n*Conclusion: Molecule C has a `dtt` signal but not a `dtq` signal.*\n\n---\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n        CH₃(f)   CH₃(g)\n         |        |\nCH₃ -- CH(b) -- CH(c) -- CH₂ -- COOH\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** Is adjacent to the CH₂(d) group (2H, triplet), the CH₃(g) substituent (3H, quartet), and the H(b) proton (1H, doublet). This proton would show a **dtq** signal.\n*   **Proton H(b):** Is adjacent to H(c) (1H, doublet), the terminal CH₃(a) group (3H, quartet), and the CH₃(f) substituent (3H, quartet). This proton gives a **dqq** signal.\n*Conclusion: Molecule D has a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal.*\n\n---\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula represents 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, as derived from its connectivity: `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH` is not correct, the longest chain must be found. The correct interpretation based on formula `C₉H₁₈O₂` is the structure known as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (after identifying the longest carbon chain). Let's analyze this structure, which matches the provided formula.\n```\n                           CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C3)\n                           |\nCH₃ -- CH₂ -- CH(f) -- CH(c) -- CH₂ -- COOH\n                  |\n                  CH₃ (methyl on C4)\n```\nLet's analyze the key methine (CH) protons:\n*   **Proton H(c) (on C3):** Is adjacent to the H(f) proton on C4 (1H, doublet), the CH₂(b) group on C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This proton would show a **dtt** signal.\n*   **Proton H(f) (on C4):** Is adjacent to the H(c) proton on C3 (1H, doublet), the CH₂(g) group on C5 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃(e) methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This proton would show a **dtq** signal.\n\n**Conclusion: Molecule A is the only structure that exhibits both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.**\n\nFinal verification confirms that molecule A fits all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
