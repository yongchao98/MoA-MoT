    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the pH for the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H$^{+}$ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H$^{+}$ + Cl$^{-}$.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol H$^{+}$**\n\n*   **Moles of OH$^{-}$ from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 → Ba$^{2+}$ + 2OH$^{-}$.\n    *   Note that each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH$^{-}$.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH$^{-}$ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH$^{-}$**\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH$^{-}$) will react with the acids. It will neutralize the strong acid (H$^{+}$ from HCl) first, followed by the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   The 0.180 mol of OH$^{-}$ reacts with the 0.080 mol of H$^{+}$ from HCl.\n    *   OH$^{-}$ (aq) + H$^{+}$ (aq) → H2O (l)\n    *   Moles of OH$^{-}$ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH$^{-}$**\n    *   All the strong acid is consumed.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   The remaining 0.100 mol of OH$^{-}$ reacts with the 0.050 mol of CH3COOH.\n    *   OH$^{-}$ (aq) + CH3COOH (aq) → CH3COO$^{-}$ (aq) + H2O (l)\n    *   The weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant here.\n    *   Moles of OH$^{-}$ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH$^{-}$**\n    *   All the weak acid is consumed, and 0.050 mol of its conjugate base (CH3COO$^{-}$) is formed.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH$^{-}$.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of a strong base (OH$^{-}$). The pH will be determined by this excess strong base, as its contribution to the overall hydroxide concentration is far greater than that from the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base (CH3COO$^{-}$).\n\n*   **Total Volume of the final solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Concentration of OH$^{-}$:**\n    *   [OH$^{-}$] = Moles of excess OH$^{-}$ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH$^{-}$] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH$^{-}$]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167)\n    *   pOH ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38\n    *   pH = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
