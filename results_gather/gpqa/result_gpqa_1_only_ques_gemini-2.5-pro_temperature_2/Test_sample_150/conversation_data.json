    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Identify the Given Information\n\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the state vector `|ψ>`.\n    `|ψ> = [[-1], [2], [1]]` (in column matrix form)\n*   The observable is represented by the operator matrix `P`.\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   We need to find the probability of measuring the value `λ = 0`.\n\n### 2. The Physics Principles\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the possible results of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of its corresponding operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ>` is given by:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |<v_λ|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>`\n\nwhere:\n*   `|v_λ>` is the eigenvector of the operator corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `<v_λ|` is the bra vector (conjugate transpose) of `|v_λ>`.\n*   `<v_λ|ψ>` is the inner product (or projection) of the state `|ψ>` onto the eigenvector `|v_λ>`.\n*   `<ψ|ψ>` is the squared norm of the state vector, which is used for normalization.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.**\n\nTo find the eigenvector `|v₀>` for `λ=0`, we need to solve the equation `P|v₀> = 0 * |v₀>`, which simplifies to `P|v₀> = 0`.\nLet the eigenvector `|v₀> = [[x], [y], [z]]`.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  =>  `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`  => `x + z = 0`  => `x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2)y = 0` (This is the same as the first equation)\n\nFrom these equations, we know `y = 0` and `x = -z`. We can choose a value for `z` to define an eigenvector. Let's choose `z = 1`, which gives `x = -1`.\nSo, an unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀>` for `λ=0` is:\n`|v₀> = [[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\nWe now need to normalize this eigenvector, though it is not strictly necessary for the final calculation as the normalization factors will cancel out. However, using the standard formula with a normalized eigenvector is good practice.\n\nThe norm of `|v₀>` is `sqrt((-1)² + 0² + 1²) = sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2)`.\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v₀_norm>` is:\n`|v₀_norm> = (1/√2) * [[-1], [0], [1]] = [[-1/√2], [0], [1/√2]]`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the squared norm of the state vector |ψ>.**\n\nThe squared norm is `<ψ|ψ>`.\n`|ψ> = [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the inner product <v₀_norm|ψ>.**\n\nFirst, find the bra vector `<v₀_norm|`, which is the conjugate transpose of `|v₀_norm>`. Since the elements are real, it is just the transpose.\n`<v₀_norm| = [-1/√2, 0, 1/√2]`\n\nNow compute the inner product:\n`<v₀_norm|ψ> = [-1/√2, 0, 1/√2] * [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n`= (-1/√2) * (-1) + (0) * (2) + (1/√2) * (1)`\n`= 1/√2 + 0 + 1/√2`\n`= 2/√2 = √2`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final probability.**\n\nUsing the formula `Prob(λ) = |<v_λ|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>`:\n`Prob(0) = |<v₀_norm|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>`\n`Prob(0) = |√2|² / 6`\n`Prob(0) = 2 / 6`\n`Prob(0) = 1/3`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0 is **1/3**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
