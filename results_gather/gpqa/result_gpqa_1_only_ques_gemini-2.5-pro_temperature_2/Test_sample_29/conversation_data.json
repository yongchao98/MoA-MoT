    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Find the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n    A useful shortcut for converting between energy in electron-volts (eV) and wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n    λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Given the energy of the *emitted* light is 2.3393 eV:\n    λ_emitted ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\n    λ_emitted ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n    The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nm to 750 nm. A wavelength of 530 nm falls within the **green** region of the spectrum (approx. 495-570 nm). So, the dye emits green light.\n\n3.  **Relate emitted light to absorbed light.**\n    When a molecule absorbs light, it enters an excited state. It then typically loses a small amount of energy through non-radiative processes (like vibration) before it emits light (fluorescence) to return to the ground state. This phenomenon is known as the **Stokes shift**.\n\n    Because of the Stokes shift, the emitted light always has a lower energy (and therefore a longer wavelength) than the absorbed light.\n    *   Wavelength of emitted light (green) ≈ 530 nm.\n    *   Therefore, the wavelength of absorbed light must be *shorter* than 530 nm (λ_absorbed < 530 nm).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options.**\n    Let's examine the approximate wavelengths for the colors listed in the options:\n    *   A) Red: ~620-750 nm (longer than 530 nm)\n    *   B) Blue: ~450-495 nm (shorter than 530 nm)\n    *   C) Yellow: ~570-590 nm (longer than 530 nm)\n    *   D) Violet: ~400-450 nm (shorter than 530 nm)\n\n    Both blue and violet light have wavelengths shorter than the emitted green light. However, the Stokes shift for most organic dyes is relatively small. Since green light is spectrally adjacent to blue light, it is most probable that the compound absorbs blue light to produce green emission. The shift from violet absorption to green emission would be significantly larger and less common. Therefore, blue is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
