    "This problem involves calculating the energy states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. System Properties**\n*   **Particles:** Four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are spin-1/2 particles, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Potential:** A one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Key Principle:** As fermions, these particles must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number 'n' and the spin magnetic quantum number 'm_s' (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down). This means each spatial energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n**3. Calculating the Multi-Particle State Energies**\n\n**Ground State (E_g):**\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **n=1 level (Energy E):** We can place two fermions (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n=2 level (Energy 4E):** We have two more fermions to place. We put them in the next lowest level, n=2 (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_g = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_g = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_g = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**First Excited State (E_1st):**\nThe first excited state is the lowest possible energy state above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available energy level.\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   The highest occupied energy level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied energy level is n=3.\n*   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**Second Excited State (E_2nd):**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\nLet's find the next possible energy value by considering other excitations:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from a lower level. Excite one particle from n=1 to the lowest unoccupied level n=3.\n    *   **Configuration:** One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   **Energy:** $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote a particle to a higher level. Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4 (instead of n=3).\n    *   **Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n    *   **Energy:** $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n*   **Possibility C:** A double excitation. Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   **Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n    *   **Energy:** $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Ground state energy = 10E\n*   First excited state energy = 15E\n*   Second excited state energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
