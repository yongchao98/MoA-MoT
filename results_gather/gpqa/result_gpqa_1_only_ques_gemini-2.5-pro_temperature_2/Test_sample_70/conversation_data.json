    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its star. It depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The intensity of the star's radiation decreases with the square of the distance. The planet's temperature is determined by balancing the energy it absorbs with the energy it radiates. This leads to the relationship:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nwhere 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. For a circular orbit, 'a' is simply the orbital radius.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 ($T_{eq,4}$) and Planet_2 ($T_{eq,2}$) is:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nwhere $a_2$ and $a_4$ are the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n*(Note: The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so the albedo term in the full equilibrium temperature formula cancels out in the ratio.)*\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance (Semi-Major Axis) to Orbital Period**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a):\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nThis can be rewritten to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets in the same system is:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the Relationships and Calculate the Temperature Ratio**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes from Step 2 into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**4. Use the Given Period Ratios**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods:\nP1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{2}{7/2} = \\frac{4}{7}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute this value into our final equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n$\\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.5714$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.82998...$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get ~0.83. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
