    "This scenario describes a classic T-cell-dependent B cell response in a mucosal secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch). Let's break down the key events and evaluate the options:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery and Uptake:** The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are delivered orally and taken up in the Peyer's patches.\n2.  **Cell Activation and Proliferation:** The presence of fluorescent, proliferating cells indicates that antigen-presenting cells have presented the rotavirus protein to B cells (and helper T cells), leading to B cell activation and clonal expansion within structures called germinal centers.\n3.  **Genetic Sequencing:** You sequence the variable heavy chain gene of this proliferating population. The \"variable heavy chain\" is the part of the antibody that binds to the antigen.\n4.  **Key Observation:** You observe \"high variability\" within this gene. This means that B cells, which all started by recognizing the same antigen, are now accumulating mutations in the part of their DNA that codes for the antigen-binding site.\n\nNow let's analyze the options in light of this observation:\n\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation:** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. It introduces point mutations at a high rate into the variable-region genes of immunoglobulins. This process is responsible for generating variants, and B cells with higher-affinity antibodies are then selected to survive (a process called affinity maturation). The result is exactly what is described: \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene among a population of proliferating B cells.\n\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that enhances the immune response. It does not involve any genetic changes to B cell genes.\n\n*   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in developing B cells in the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow), *before* they ever encounter an antigen. The process described in the question is happening in a *secondary* lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure.\n\n*   **D) Class switching recombination:** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which would be common in a mucosal response) but does not alter the antigen-binding site itself. Therefore, it would not cause variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\nThe finding of high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene of an activated, proliferating B cell population is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
