    "**1. Determine the molecular formula and structure**\n\nThe molecule is given by the condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\nLet's analyze the structure to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and the number of each type of bond.\n\nThe structure can be drawn as:\n```\n      CH3                             CH3\n      |                               |\nCH3 - C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n                         |\n                         CH3\n```\nLet's count the atoms:\n- **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n  - `(CH3)2C=` group: 1 central C + 2 C from CH3 groups = 3 C\n  - `=CH-` group: 1 C\n  - `-CH2-` group: 1 C\n  - `-CH(CH3)-` group: 1 C in the chain + 1 C from the CH3 group = 2 C\n  - `-CH2-` group: 1 C\n  - `-CH=` group: 1 C\n  - `=C(CH3)2` group: 1 central C + 2 C from CH3 groups = 3 C\n  - Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C\n\n- **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n  - `(CH3)2C=` group: 2 * 3 H = 6 H\n  - `=CH-` group: 1 H\n  - `-CH2-` group: 2 H\n  - `-CH(CH3)-` group: 1 H on the chain + 3 H from the CH3 group = 4 H\n  - `-CH2-` group: 2 H\n  - `-CH=` group: 1 H\n  - `=C(CH3)2` group: 2 * 3 H = 6 H\n  - Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the number of each type of bond**\n\n- **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n- **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure: `(CH3)2C=CH...` and `...CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n- **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n  - In `(CH3)2C=`: 2 C-C bonds between the central carbon and the two methyl groups.\n  - In `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C-C bond between the chain carbon and the methyl group.\n  - In `=C(CH3)2`: 2 C-C bonds between the central carbon and the two methyl groups.\n  - Bonds along the main chain: `=CH-CH2-`, `-CH2-CH(`, `-CH)-CH2-`, `-CH2-CH=`. That's 4 C-C bonds.\n  - Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n- 22 C-H bonds\n- 9 C-C bonds\n- 2 C=C bonds\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change for the reaction that forms one mole of the compound from its constituent elements in their standard states.\nThe reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe can calculate ΔH_f using a Hess cycle involving atomization energies and bond energies:\nΔH_f = [Sum of enthalpies of atomization of reactants] - [Sum of bond energies of the product]\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\nThis is the energy required to convert the reactants in their standard state into gaseous atoms.\n- For Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n  Energy = 12 * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n- For Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n  Energy = 11 * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n- Total enthalpy for reactant atomization = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the sum of bond energies of the product.**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, C12H22.\n- Energy for 22 C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n- Energy for 9 C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n- Energy for 2 C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n- Total bond energy of the product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the final enthalpy of formation.**\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Convert the result to the required units**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g or kJ/mol. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to check against option A.\nFirst, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (MM) ≈ 12 * (atomic mass of C) + 22 * (atomic mass of H)\nMM ≈ 12 * 12 g/mol + 22 * 1 g/mol = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n\nNow, convert ΔH_f from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / MM (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**\n\n**5. Compare with the given options**\n\n- A) 11.44 kJ/g - This value is a very close match to our calculated value.\n- B) 11200 kJ/mol - This is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\n- C) 1900 kJ/g - This has the correct number but the wrong units. Our result was 1900 kJ/mol.\n- D) 67.4 kJ/mol - This does not match our calculations.\n\nThe calculated value of 11.446 kJ/g corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
