    "This problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution containing dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4-) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-).\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each component:**\n\n*   **KH2PO4:** This salt dissolves to provide K+ and H2PO4- ions.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol.\n\n*   **Na2HPO4●2H2O:** This salt dissolves to provide 2Na+, HPO4^2- ions, and 2 water molecules.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n\n*   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is equal to 200.00 mL or 0.20000 L.\n*   Concentration of H2PO4- = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n*   Concentration of HPO4^2- = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the relevant buffer equilibrium:**\n\n*   The main components are H2PO4- (a weak acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base). The equilibrium that governs the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H2PO4-  ⇌  H+ + HPO4^2-     (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n*   We can rearrange the acid dissociation constant expression to solve for [H+]:\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n*   Substitute the concentrations calculated in step 2. We can use the initial concentrations because the amount that dissociates or associates is negligible compared to the large initial amounts.\n    [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H+] = 8.109 x 10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-]:**\n\n*   Orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) are produced from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4^2-  ⇌  H+ + PO4^3-     (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n*   The expression for this equilibrium is:\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n*   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n*   Now, substitute the known values: Ka3, the concentration of HPO4^2- from step 2, and the concentration of H+ calculated in step 3.\n    [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10^-8 M)\n    [PO4^3-] = 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\n**5. Compare the result to the given options:**\n\n*   The calculated value is 6.236 x 10^-7 M.\n*   Rounding to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n*   This matches option C.\n\nA) 2.81x10^-7 M\nB) 3.97x10^-7 M\nC) 6.24x10^-7 M\nD) 5.48x10^-7 M\n\n<<<C>>>"
