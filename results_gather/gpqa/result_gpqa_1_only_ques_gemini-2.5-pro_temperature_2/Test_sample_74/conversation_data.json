  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "An analysis of the provided DNA sequence is required to determine the cause of the failed protein expression.\n\n1.  **Identify the components of the construct:** The sequence should contain a start codon (ATG), the N-terminal HA tag sequence, and the GADD45G coding sequence.\n2.  **Analyze the HA tag:** The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's translate the beginning of the provided DNA sequence, reading it in codons (triplets) starting from the ATG.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The translated N-terminus is M-YPYDVPDYA. This confirms the start codon and the HA tag sequence are correct. Option (D) is incorrect.\n3.  **Analyze the sequence immediately following the HA tag:** The sequence continues after the HA tag's `GCC` codon.\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   `TGA` -> **STOP**\n4.  **Identify the problem:** The `TGA` codon is a stop codon. In the corresponding mRNA, this would be `UGA`. When the ribosome encounters this codon, it will recruit a release factor, which causes the ribosome to dissociate from the mRNA and release the nascent polypeptide chain. This terminates protein synthesis (translation) prematurely. The full-length GADD45G protein is never made. Instead, only a tiny 11-amino-acid peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) is produced. This explains why the full-length protein cannot be detected.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options based on this finding:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a linker can be important, the primary issue here is that the full-length protein is never synthesized, so proteolysis of a full-length chain is not the problem.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** The problematic codon is TGA (UGA in mRNA), not TAA (UAA in mRNA). Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation. This statement is incorrect.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what happens due to the premature `TGA` stop codon in the engineered sequence. This is the correct explanation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
