    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for DoU is: `C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1`\n*   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n*   DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\n*   DoU = 5\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring. The C=O group suggested by the IR spectrum accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band. An amide would also be in this region but usually appears different.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from the usual ~1740 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Summary of IR analysis:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, so it is a methyl (-CH3) group. The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, so it is a methylene (-CH2-) group. The splitting is a quartet (q), which means it is adjacent to a CH3 group (3+1=4). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield, which is characteristic of a CH2 group attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. This chemical shift and appearance are typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2), confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The total integration is 4 protons, indicating a disubstituted benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets is characteristic of **para (1,4) disubstitution**. The two groups on the ring are different, creating two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Check the Options:**\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide. The NMR aromatic region and the IR C=O stretch would be different.\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure matches all the data perfectly: a para-substituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (would show one N-H band) and the NMR (would have a formyl -CHO proton signal ~8-8.5 ppm).\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester (Ar-O-CO-R). The C=O stretch in the IR would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹). The CH2 group of the propionate would appear around 2.2-2.5 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
