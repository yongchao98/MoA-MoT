    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the given information and frames of reference.**\n\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** c ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is Δt' = 50 s. \"Proper time\" is the time measured by a clock at rest in its own reference frame.\n*   **Goal:** Find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δx).\n\n**2. Understand the relevant concepts from Special Relativity.**\n\nThis problem involves time dilation. According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary reference frame will see a clock that is moving relative to them tick more slowly. The time measured in the stationary frame (Δt) is longer than the time measured in the moving frame (Δt', the proper time). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt'\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n\nFirst, we calculate the velocity of the ejecta as a fraction of the speed of light (β):\nβ = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nThe Lorentz factor is defined as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - β²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\nγ = 1 / √(0.96)\n\nFor calculations where β is small (like 0.2), we can use the binomial approximation: γ ≈ 1 + β²/2.\nγ ≈ 1 + (0.2)² / 2\nγ ≈ 1 + 0.04 / 2\nγ ≈ 1 + 0.02\nγ ≈ 1.02\n\nUsing this approximation often leads to the exact answers provided in multiple-choice questions.\n\n**4. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n\nUsing the time dilation formula with our approximated γ:\nΔt = γ * Δt'\nΔt ≈ 1.02 * 50 s\nΔt ≈ 51 s\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, an observer in the Galaxy's frame measures that 51 seconds have passed.\n\n**5. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δx).**\n\nThe distance is simply the speed multiplied by the time, both measured in the same (Galaxy) frame.\nΔx = v * Δt\nΔx ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s\nΔx ≈ 3,060,000 km\n\n*Alternative calculation without approximating γ until the end:*\n\nΔx = v * Δt = v * γ * Δt'\nΔx = (v * Δt') * γ\nThe classical distance (without relativity) would be v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\nΔx = 3,000,000 km * γ\nUsing the approximated γ ≈ 1.02:\nΔx ≈ 3,000,000 km * 1.02 = 3,060,000 km.\n\n(If we use the more precise value for γ ≈ 1/√(0.96) ≈ 1.02062, the distance would be approximately 3,061,862 km. The answer choice C indicates that the approximation γ ≈ 1.02 was intended.)\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 3,000,000 km (This is the classical answer, ignoring time dilation).\nB) 2,940,000 km (This result would come from incorrectly dividing by γ, a common mistake).\nC) 3,060,000 km (This matches our calculation using the standard approximation for γ).\nD) 2,880,000 km (Incorrect application of formulas).\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
