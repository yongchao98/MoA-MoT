    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a substituted cyclohexanone. The C=O group is at position 1. C2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group (quaternary center). C6 has a methyl group (tertiary center).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    The base t-BuOK will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **α-carbon C2:** This carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3). It has **no** α-protons. Deprotonation cannot occur here.\n    *   **α-carbon C6:** This carbon is tertiary (bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one hydrogen). It has **one** α-proton.\n    Therefore, the base will unambiguously abstract the proton from C6, forming the corresponding potassium enolate. This is the only possible enolate, so questions of kinetic vs. thermodynamic control do not arise for the regioselectivity.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate). This is a conjugate addition (or 1,4-addition). The C6 of the enolate forms a new C-C bond with the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A subsequent protonation step (usually from workup or the conjugate acid of the base) neutralizes the intermediate to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    The product is an ethyl propanoate with a large substituent on the 3rd carbon.\n    *   Parent Chain: `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`\n    *   Substituent: A cyclohexanone ring attached at its C6 position. To name the substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (C1').\n        *   The point of attachment (original C6) is C1'. It has a methyl group. → `1-methyl`\n        *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is at C2'. → `2-oxo`\n        *   The quaternary center (original C2) is at C3'. It has an ethyl and a methyl group. → `3-ethyl, 3-methyl`\n    *   The full substituent name is: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`\n    *   Combining these gives the final name for Product A: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    The electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO₂) makes the α-protons (on the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) acidic. The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion, called a nitronate anion.\n    `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + KOH → CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂ K⁺ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane forms a new C-C bond with the β-carbon of the nitrile. The resulting carbanion intermediate is then protonated by water.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    The product structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Parent Chain: The longest carbon chain including the nitrile group (`-CN`). Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon.\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n        The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   A methyl group at position 3 → `3-methyl`\n        *   A nitro group at position 4 → `4-nitro`\n    *   Combining these gives the final name for Product B: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = incorrect, B = correct\n*   C) **A = correct, B = correct**\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
