    "This is a great puzzle that can be solved by understanding the structure of calculations in quantum field theory. The key to finding the number of loops lies in the factor of `1/(4π)`.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nIn a quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime, when you calculate a Feynman diagram with loops, each loop integral introduces a factor of momentum integration, `∫d⁴k / (2π)⁴`. After performing the standard steps of these calculations (like Wick rotation and integrating over the angles in 4D Euclidean space), each loop integral contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(16π²)`, which can be written as **`1/(4π)²`**.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The overall factor from the loop integrations will therefore be:\n\n`(1 / (4π)²) ^ L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\nNow, we look at the expression from your colleague's note:\n\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe crucial term here is `1/(4π)⁶`. We can set this equal to the general form for an L-loop diagram:\n\n`1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)⁶`\n\nBy comparing the exponents, we get:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`, we find:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with this. The factors of `alpha^3 * g^2` indicate the presence of five vertices (three with coupling `alpha` and two with coupling `g`), which is perfectly reasonable for a 3-loop diagram. The remaining numerical factors and the ratio of energy scales are specific details of the diagram's final value, but the power of `(4π)` is the most direct indicator of the loop number.\n\n<<<A>>>"
