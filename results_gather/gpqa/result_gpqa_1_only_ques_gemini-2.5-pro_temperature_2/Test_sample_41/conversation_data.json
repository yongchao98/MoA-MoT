    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nIn this problem, the three planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. We are also told that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms except `a` are constant. This simplifies the relationship to:\n\nT_eq ∝ a^(-1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Period to Semi-Major Axis using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nWe can rearrange this to express `a` in terms of `P`:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n**3. Combine the two relationships to relate Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Period**\n\nNow, substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law (Step 2) into the temperature relationship (Step 1):\n\nT_eq ∝ a^(-1/2) ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\nT_eq ∝ P^(-1/3) or T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis means the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets (e.g., Planet A and Planet B) is related to the ratio of their orbital periods as follows:\n\n(T_A / T_B) = (P_B / P_A)^(1/3)\n\n**4. Use the given data to calculate the ratios of orbital periods**\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\nLet's use our derived formula to find the period ratios:\n\n*   For Planet1 and Planet2:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)\n    1.4 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)\n    P2 / P1 = 1.4³ = 2.744\n\n*   For Planet2 and Planet3:\n    (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = (P3 / P2)^(1/3)\n    2.3 = (P3 / P2)^(1/3)\n    P3 / P2 = 2.3³ = 12.167\n\n**5. Calculate the final required ratio: P3 / P1**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio P3 / P1. We can find this by multiplying the two ratios we just calculated:\n\nP3 / P1 = (P3 / P2) * (P2 / P1)\nP3 / P1 = 12.167 * 2.744\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.38\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n*Note on extra information:* The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation, as the planets' masses are negligible compared to their host star's mass. The specific albedo value is also not needed, only the fact that it is the same for all planets.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nOur calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
