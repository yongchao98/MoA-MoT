    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State (Standard Sun):** The Sun produces neutrinos from several reactions. The main ones to consider for the energy bands in question are:\n    *   **pp-II branch:** Produces ⁷Be neutrinos, which have a discrete energy line at 861 keV. This is the dominant source of neutrinos in Band 2.\n    *   **pp-III branch:** Produces ⁸B neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to ~15 MeV. These contribute to the continuous background flux in both Band 1 and Band 2.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** Produces ¹³N and ¹⁵O neutrinos, which also have continuous spectra. These contribute a smaller continuous background flux in both bands.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Change:** The pp-III branch stops.\n    *   This means the production of ⁸B neutrinos ceases entirely.\n    *   The question explicitly states that all other reactions, including the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, remain as they were. The production of ⁷Be and CNO neutrinos is unaffected.\n    *   The change happened 8.5 minutes ago, which is the travel time for light (and neutrinos) from the Sun to Earth. So we are observing the fluxes *after* this change has occurred.\n\n3.  **Determine the Sources of Flux in Each Band *After* the Change:**\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** With the ⁸B neutrinos gone, the only remaining source of flux in this energy range is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle neutrinos (¹³N and ¹⁵O).\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The ⁸B neutrinos are gone, but two sources remain: the continuous spectrum from CNO neutrinos, and more importantly, the **very intense, sharp energy line of ⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV**, which falls squarely inside this band.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to calculate the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n    *   Flux (Band 1) = The integrated flux of CNO neutrinos from 700 to 800 keV.\n    *   Flux (Band 2) = The integrated flux of CNO neutrinos from 800 to 900 keV + the total flux of the ⁷Be line neutrinos.\n\n5.  **Estimate the Magnitudes (Order of Magnitude Estimation):** The options are powers of 10, suggesting an order-of-magnitude estimation is sufficient.\n    *   The total flux of all CNO cycle neutrinos from the Sun is approximately 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n    *   The total flux of the ⁷Be line neutrinos is much larger, approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\n    Now let's relate these total fluxes to the fluxes in our specific bands.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2:** The flux from the ⁷Be line (5 x 10⁹) is vastly larger than the flux from CNO neutrinos in that same small band. Therefore, we can approximate the flux in Band 2 as being equal to the total ⁷Be neutrino flux.\n        *   Flux (Band 2) ≈ Flux_total(⁷Be) ≈ 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n    *   **Flux in Band 1:** This is the portion of the CNO neutrino flux that falls within the 700-800 keV window. The CNO spectrum is continuous and broad (extending up to ~1.7 MeV). We need to estimate what fraction of the total CNO flux falls into our 100 keV wide window. For an approximate calculation, a value of 10% (or 0.1) is a reasonable estimate for a 100 keV slice of a spectrum that is ~1-2 MeV wide, especially since our band is near the peak of the ¹⁵O spectrum.\n        *   Fraction of CNO flux in Band 1 ≈ 0.1 (a 10% guesstimate).\n        *   Flux (Band 1) ≈ Flux_total(CNO) * (fraction in band) ≈ (5 x 10⁸) * 0.1 = 5 x 10⁷ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\n    *   Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)\n    *   Ratio ≈ 1 x 10⁻² = 0.01\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\nThe key takeaway is that Band 2's flux is dominated by the very strong and unaffected ⁷Be line (from pp-II), while Band 1's flux is from a small fraction of the total CNO flux. The ratio of the total CNO flux to the total ⁷Be flux is already 0.1, and considering only a fraction of the CNO flux reduces the ratio by another order of magnitude to approximately 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>"
