    "This is a common expression used by organic chemists when referring to chromatography, a primary technique used to separate and purify compounds from a reaction mixture.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or Column Chromatography, compounds are separated based on their differential interaction with a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). This interaction is primarily governed by the polarity of the compounds.\n\n*   **TLC:** Chemists run a TLC plate to visualize the components of a mixture. Different compounds travel up the plate at different rates, forming distinct spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate, and their spots will be very close together or even overlap entirely. An observer would say the spots are \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **Column Chromatography:** This technique is used to physically separate larger quantities of a mixture. If two compounds have similar polarities, they will move down the column at similar rates and will be collected in the same fractions, making purification difficult or impossible. This is another scenario where a chemist would complain that their compounds are \"on top of each other.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A) Similar boiling points would be a problem for distillation, not typically described this way.\n*   C) While polarity is a result of non-covalent/van der Waals interactions, the more direct and relevant property causing the failed separation is polarity itself. \"On top of each other\" specifically refers to the outcome of a separation experiment.\n*   D) Optical rotation is a property used for characterization of chiral compounds, not for separation.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is lamenting their inability to separate the compounds using chromatography because they have nearly identical polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
