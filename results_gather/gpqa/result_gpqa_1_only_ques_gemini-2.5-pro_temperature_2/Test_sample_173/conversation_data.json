    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Define Masses and Energies**\n\nFirst, let's establish the masses and energies of the particles involved.\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, with mass M and rest-mass energy $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300$ GeV.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. Let $m_1$ be the more massive fragment.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2$\n*   We are also given that the sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations for $m_1$ and $m_2$:\nSubstitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$\nThen, $m_1 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n\nNow we can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$):\n    $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$):\n    $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy Release)**\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest energy and the sum of the final rest energies.\n$Q = E_{initial\\_rest} - E_{final\\_rest} = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n$\\vec{p_1} + \\vec{p_2} = 0 \\implies |\\vec{p_1}| = |\\vec{p_2}|$. Let's call this momentum magnitude $p$.\n\n**4. Classical Calculation for T1**\n\nIn the non-relativistic (classical) approximation, kinetic energy is given by $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\nSince the momenta are equal ($p_1=p_2=p$), we can write the kinetic energies as:\n$T_{1,class} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n$T_{2,class} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n$\\frac{T_{1,class}}{T_{2,class}} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$\nSince $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This means $T_{2,class} = 2T_{1,class}$.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy equation:\n$T_{1,class} + T_{2,class} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,class} + 2T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_{1,class} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, using the classical approximation, is 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Relativistic Calculation for T1**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy E, momentum p, and rest-mass m is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$. We also know that total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest energy, $E = T + mc^2$.\nCombining these, we get:\n$(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \\implies (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal ($p_1=p_2=p$), we can equate their $(pc)^2$ values:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_{1,rel}^2 + 2T_{1,rel}m_1c^2 = T_{2,rel}^2 + 2T_{2,rel}m_2c^2$\n\nWe know $T_1 + T_2 = Q$, so $T_{2,rel} = Q - T_{1,rel} = 3 \\text{ GeV} - T_{1,rel}$.\nSubstitute this into the momentum equation:\n$T_{1,rel}^2 + 2T_{1,rel}(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_{1,rel})^2 + 2(Q - T_{1,rel})(m_2c^2)$\n\nLet's plug in the known energy values ($Q=3$, $m_1c^2=198$, $m_2c^2=99$, all in GeV):\n$T_1^2 + 2 T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n$T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = (9 - 6 T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198 T_1)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$396 T_1 = 9 - 6 T_1 + 594 - 198 T_1$\n$396 T_1 = 603 - 204 T_1$\n\nNow, group the $T_1$ terms:\n$396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n$600 T_1 = 603$\n$T_{1,rel} = \\frac{603}{600} = \\frac{201}{200} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 1.005 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value from the classical approximation.\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_{1,rel} - T_{1,class}$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n$\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\text{ GeV} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ MeV}}{1 \\text{ GeV}} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
