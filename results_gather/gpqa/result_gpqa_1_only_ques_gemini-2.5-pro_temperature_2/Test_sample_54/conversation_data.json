    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Groups:**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of the signals to find the total number of protons in the molecule:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow let's compare this with the number of protons in the possible compounds:\n*   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): Has 8 protons. This is a possible match.\n*   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Has 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n\nThis initial analysis immediately rules out both Cis-butenyl acetate (B) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C), as they have the wrong number of protons. The unknown compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet with an integration of 3H at ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). The singlet multiplicity indicates it has no adjacent protons.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet with an integration of 3H suggests a methyl group (CH₃) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton. The chemical shift (~1.6 ppm) is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond, CH₃-C=C).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A doublet with an integration of 1H in the alkene region (~7.0 ppm) corresponds to a vinyl proton (a proton on a double bond). The high chemical shift is due to deshielding by an adjacent electron-withdrawing group, in this case, the ester oxygen (`-O-CO-CH₃`). The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to only one other proton. The coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) is a crucial piece of information.\n    *   **Cis coupling constants** are typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   **Trans coupling constants** are typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   A J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** arrangement between this proton and its coupling partner.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A signal for one proton (1H) with a doublet of quartets (dq) multiplicity. This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighbors:\n    *   It is split by one proton into a doublet (the \"d\" part of dq).\n    *   It is split by a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group) into a quartet (the \"q\" part of dq).\n\n**3. Assemble the Structure:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An acetate group: `CH₃COO-` (from the 2.1 ppm signal)\n*   A propenyl group with the structure `CH₃-CH=CH-` (from the 1.6 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 7.0 ppm signals)\n\nLet's combine them: The structure is `CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃`.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n*   **H₃C-CH(B)=CH(A)-O-CO-CH₃(C)**\n*   **Protons (C):** The acetate methyl group. It has no neighbors, so it's a singlet. This is the **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** signal.\n*   **Proton (A):** The vinyl proton attached to the carbon with the oxygen atom. It is the most deshielded vinyl proton. It is coupled to proton (B), so it appears as a doublet. This is the **7.0 ppm (1H, d)** signal. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) indicates it is **trans** to proton (B).\n*   **Proton (B):** The other vinyl proton. It is coupled to proton (A) (giving a doublet) and the methyl group on the double bond (giving a quartet). The overall multiplicity is a doublet of quartets. This is the **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** signal.\n*   **Methyl group on double bond:** This methyl group is coupled to proton (B), so it appears as a doublet. This is the **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** signal.\n\nAll the data perfectly matches the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound has 8 protons, ruling out the butenyl acetate options. The large coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz for the vinyl protons confirms a trans configuration across the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
