    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen. This means it's an alkane or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let the formula be CxHy. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`. This is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` -> `7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x` -> `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is widely used as a solvent and is a liquid. Common examples are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its hydrogenation:**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D) and it does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z. Let's say Y = {C, D}.\n    *   This means `C + H2 -> Z` and `D + H2 -> Z`.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume C = Z. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n), it won't react with hydrogen (`Z + H2 -> Z`).\n    *   For the other component, D, the reaction `D + H2 -> Z` must occur. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, but can be hydrogenated, D is most likely an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires severe conditions, which is consistent with the problem description.\n    *   If Z is the cycloalkane CnH2n, then D must be its aromatic precursor. The smallest aromatic ring is a benzene ring (6 carbons), so n must be ≥ 6.\n        *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be benzene (C6H6). Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n        *   If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D must be toluene (C7H8). Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n        Both are plausible scenarios so far.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B).\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. So, `A + H2 -> Z` and `B + H2 -> Z`. This implies A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The reaction `X -> Y` is described as a disproportionation. Since X is an equimolar mixture of A and B, and Y is an equimolar mixture of C and D, the simplest and most likely stoichiometry is `A + B -> C + D`.\n    *   This reaction represents a hydrogen transfer: one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n        *   The reduced product is C=Z, the saturated cycloalkane CnH2n.\n        *   The oxidized product is D, the aromatic compound.\n\n4.  **Determine the formulas of A and B:**\n    *   Let's establish the level of unsaturation. Let A and B be monocyclic compounds (since Z is monocyclic). Their general formulas are CnH(2n-2π), where π is the number of double bonds.\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C + D`.\n        *   `A` gets reduced to `C=Z=CnH2n`. So, A must be a cycloalkene, CnH(2n-2). Let's say it has `πA = 1` double bond.\n        *   `B` gets oxidized to `D=aromatic`. To become aromatic from a cycloalkane precursor, 3 double bonds must be formed in a ring. A cycloalkadiene `(B)` oxidizing to an aromatic ring `(D)` is a plausible step. Let's see the hydrogen balance.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance for the overall reaction: `A + B -> C + D`.\n        *   We have `A + B -> CnH2n + D`. D is an aromatic compound with one benzene ring, so its formula is CnH(2n-6).\n        *   Total hydrogens in products: `2n + (2n-6) = 4n-6`.\n        *   Let A have `πA` double bonds (formula CnH(2n-2πA)) and B have `πB` double bonds (formula CnH(2n-2πB)). A and B are different liquids.\n        *   Total hydrogens in reactants: `(2n - 2πA) + (2n - 2πB) = 4n - 2(πA + πB)`.\n        *   Equating the hydrogens: `4n - 6 = 4n - 2(πA + πB)`.\n        *   This gives `6 = 2(πA + πB)`, so `πA + πB = 3`.\n    *   Since A and B are different compounds that decolorize bromine water, they must each have at least one double bond (`πA ≥ 1`, `πB ≥ 1`). The only integer solution is {`πA`, `πB`} = {1, 2}.\n    *   So, one component of X is a cycloalkene (A, with formula CnH(2n-2)) and the other is a cycloalkadiene (B, with formula CnH(2n-4)).\n    *   The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds\", so B must be a non-conjugated diene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms and decide on 'n':**\n    *   Total H atoms in X = H in A + H in B = `(2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   Now we need to determine the value of `n`. Let's re-examine our two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **Case 1 (n=6):** Z=cyclohexane, D=benzene. This is the most fundamental example of such a system.\n            *   A = cyclohexene (C6H10), B = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) (non-conjugated).\n            *   Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **Case 2 (n=7):** Z=methylcyclohexane, D=toluene.\n            *   A = methylcyclohexene (C7H12), B = a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10).\n            *   Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and correspond to options in the answer list (B=18, C=22).\n    *   Such problems in a test setting usually have a single intended answer. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most classic and fundamental textbook example of the relationship between alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics. The C7 system is a homolog but less prototypical. In the absence of specific information ruling out the C6 case, it's the most likely intended answer.\n    *   All conditions are perfectly met by the C6 system.\n    *   The liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in these two molecules is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
