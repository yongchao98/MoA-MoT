    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Uncertainty in position of the electron: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   Speed of the electron: v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s.\n*   The particle is an electron. We will use the fundamental constant, the reduced Planck's constant: ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n**2. State the Relevant Physical Principle:**\nWe will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle for position and momentum is given by:\nΔx * Δpₓ ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position along the x-direction, and Δpₓ is the uncertainty in momentum along the x-direction.\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δpₓ):**\nFrom the uncertainty principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:\nΔpₓ,min = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nSubstitute the given values:\nΔpₓ,min = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔpₓ,min = 0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**4. Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δpₓ):**\nThe energy (E) and momentum (p) of a particle are related. For a small change (or uncertainty), we can use the derivative relationship:\nΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp\nThe derivative dE/dp is equal to the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which corresponds to the particle's speed, v. So, dE/dp = v.\nThis can be shown from the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²:\nDifferentiating with respect to p:\n2E(dE/dp) = 2pc²\ndE/dp = pc²/E\nUsing the definitions of relativistic energy (E = γm₀c²) and momentum (p = γm₀v):\ndE/dp = (γm₀v)c² / (γm₀c²) = v\nThus, the relationship is:\nΔE ≈ v * Δpₓ\n\n**5. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, we can estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy:\nΔE_min = v * Δpₓ,min\nSubstitute the values for v and Δpₓ,min:\nΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) * (0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options:**\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.\nLet's compare this value to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nOur calculated value, ~10⁻¹⁶ J, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
