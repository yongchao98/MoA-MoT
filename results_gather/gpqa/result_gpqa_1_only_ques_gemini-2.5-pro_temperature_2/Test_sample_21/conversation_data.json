    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct combination of words.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics of Oxygen as an Oxidant**\n\nTo determine the strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant), we look at its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive (larger) E° value indicates a stronger oxidant because it has a greater tendency to be reduced (i.e., to accept electrons).\n\nLet's examine the reduction half-reactions for oxygen in both acidic and basic solutions:\n\n*   **In acidic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n\n*   **In basic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\nComparing the two values, +0.40 V is significantly less positive than +1.23 V. This means that oxygen has a weaker tendency to accept electrons in a basic solution than it does in an acidic solution.\n\nTherefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics of Oxygen Reaction**\n\nThis part of the statement addresses the speed of the reaction (kinetics). The question asks about the reaction of oxygen in acidic solutions.\n\nThe reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is a notoriously slow reaction from a kinetic standpoint. This is because:\n1.  The double bond in the O₂ molecule (O=O) is very strong and requires a large amount of energy (high activation energy) to break.\n2.  The overall reaction to form water involves the transfer of four electrons, which is a complex, multi-step process.\n\nThis kinetic sluggishness is a key characteristic of oxygen. Even though it is a thermodynamically powerful oxidant (especially in acidic solution), its reactions are often slow without a catalyst or high temperatures. This is why many substances that are thermodynamically unstable in air (like iron, aluminum, or organic materials) can exist for long periods.\n\nThe statement \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts ______ in acidic solutions\" is best completed by describing this general characteristic. The most accurate description of oxygen's reaction rate is \"slow\". The option provided is \"slower\", which captures this idea of a slow, sluggish reaction. While the rate can be *faster* in acid compared to base (which explains why acidic conditions accelerate rust), the reaction is still considered slow in an absolute sense. A well-constructed question would likely test the fundamental concept of oxygen's kinetic inertness.\n\nSo, the second blank should be filled with **slower**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   First blank: **weaker**\n*   Second blank: **slower**\n\nCombining these two gives the pair **weaker - slower**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
