    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of special relativity. To solve it, we need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) and compare it to the time that passes on Earth (observer's time).\n\n**1. Identify Knowns and Unknowns:**\n*   **Speed of the spacecraft (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n*   **Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (d):** The standard astronomical distance is approximately 160,000 light-years.\n*   **Time experienced by the astronaut (t₀):** This is what we need to find.\n*   **Time as measured from Earth (t):** We need to calculate this first.\n*   **Astronaut's age:** 22 years\n*   **Alien average lifetime:** 150 years\n\n**2. Calculate the Travel Time in Earth's Reference Frame (t):**\nFirst, we calculate how long the journey takes from the perspective of an observer on Earth.\nTime = Distance / Speed\nt = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (c * 1 year), the 'c' terms cancel out:\nt = 160,000 years / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.02 years.\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor determines the magnitude of time dilation. The formula is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nGiven v/c = 0.99999987:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987)²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\nγ = 1 / √(0.00000026)\nγ = 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.15\n\n**4. Calculate the Time Experienced by the Astronaut (t₀):**\nThe time experienced by the moving astronaut (proper time, t₀) is related to the time measured on Earth (t) by the time dilation formula:\nt = γ * t₀\nTo find the astronaut's time, we rearrange the formula:\nt₀ = t / γ\nt₀ = 160,000.02 years / 1961.15\nt₀ ≈ 81.58 years\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe journey will take approximately 81.58 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n*   This value is very close to 81 years.\n*   The astronaut started the journey at age 22. Upon arrival, the astronaut's age would be 22 + 81.58 = 103.58 years. This is well within the alien's average lifetime of 150 years, so option A is incorrect.\n\nComparing our calculated value of 81.58 years to the choices provided, 81 years is the closest and most appropriate answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
