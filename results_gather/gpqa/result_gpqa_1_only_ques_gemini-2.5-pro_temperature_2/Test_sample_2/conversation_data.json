    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the expectation value.\n\n**1. Define the state and operators**\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`\n\nIn matrix representation, with `|↑⟩ = [1, 0]^T` and `|↓⟩ = [0, 1]^T`, the state vector is:\n`|ψ⟩` = `[0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector is `⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`.\nWe should check that the state is normalized: `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (0.5)² + (√3/2)² = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1`. The state is indeed normalized.\n\nThe Pauli spin matrices are:\n`σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe operator we are interested in is `A = 10σz + 5σx`.\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by `⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩`.\nWe can use the linearity of the expectation value:\n`⟨A⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`\n\n**3. Calculate `⟨σz⟩`**\n\n`⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩`\nWe know that for a state `|ψ⟩ = c↑|↑⟩ + c↓|↓⟩`, the expectation value of `σz` is `|c↑|² - |c↓|²`.\nHere, `c↑ = 0.5` and `c↓ = √3/2`.\n`⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**4. Calculate `⟨σx⟩`**\n\n`⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`\nFirst, let's find `σx|ψ⟩`:\n`σx|ψ⟩ = σx (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩)`\nSince `σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩` and `σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩`:\n`σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩`\n\nNow, we compute the inner product `⟨ψ|` with `σx|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|) * ( (√3/2)|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩ )`\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis (`⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1`, `⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1`, `⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0`, `⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0`):\n`⟨σx⟩ = 0.5 * (√3/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + 0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3/2) * (√3/2) * ⟨↓|↑⟩ + (√3/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩`\n`⟨σx⟩ = 0.5 * (√3/2) * (1) + 0 + 0 + (√3/2) * 0.5 * (1)`\n`⟨σx⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**5. Combine the results**\n\nNow we can find the final expectation value:\n`⟨A⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`\n`⟨A⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2`\n\n**6. Numerical value and rounding**\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
