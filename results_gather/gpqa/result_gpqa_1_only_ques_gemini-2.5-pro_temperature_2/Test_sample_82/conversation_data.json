    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Determine the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid, V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid, M₁ = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding 20.00 cm³ water, V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration, M₂.\n    *   (0.05 M)(20.00 cm³) = M₂(40.00 cm³)\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**2. Calculate the pKa of acetic acid.**\n*   pKa = -log(Ka)\n*   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   The solution is a buffer containing both HA and A⁻. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + (-0.477)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253, which rounds to **4.26**.\n\n**4. Calculate the volume of NaOH needed for the equivalence point.**\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O (a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    *   Moles HA = M₂ * V₂ = 0.025 mol/L * (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.00100 mol\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   Volume of NaOH (V_eq) = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.0 cm³.\n\n**5. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.0 cm³ = 50.0 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now we can find the concentration of OH⁻ produced. Let [OH⁻] = x.\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   Calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<C>>>"
