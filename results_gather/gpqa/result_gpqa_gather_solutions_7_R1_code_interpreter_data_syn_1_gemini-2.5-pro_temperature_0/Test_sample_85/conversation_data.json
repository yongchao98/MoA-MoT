Foundational Concepts**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3).\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** The key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which can change if the functional groups are modified.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nWe must determine the priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center in both the starting material and the product.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Highest priority, P1)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second priority, P2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, P3)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, P4)\n    *(Reasoning: The ester group outranks the acid group because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (in isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen.)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product Lactone:** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl, P'1)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen, P'2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, P'3)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, P'4)\n    *(Reasoning: The fragment containing the carbonyl carbon has higher priority.)*\n\n### **3. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The starting ester group (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, **P1**) is reduced to an alcohol, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment (**P'2**) in the product.\n    *   The starting acid group (`-CH₂-COOH`, **P2**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` fragment (**P'1**) in the product.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). Swapping the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **4. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   The starting ester group (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, **P1**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` fragment (**P'1**) in the product.\n    *   The starting acid group (`-CH₂-COOH`, **P2**) is reduced to an alcohol, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment (**P'2**) in the product.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the groups are maintained (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **5. Final Decision**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, A and B, we must carefully analyze each reaction, focusing on two key aspects:\n1.  **Chemoselectivity:** Which functional group (carboxylic acid or ester) does each reducing agent preferentially react with?\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** How does the chemical transformation affect the R/S designation of the chiral center?\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains a chiral center at carbon 3 and has two distinct functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(²)-CH(Et)(³)-CH₂(⁴)-C(=O)O-iBu(⁵)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). This is formed when one of the carbonyl groups of the starting material is reduced to a primary alcohol, which then cyclizes with the other carbonyl group. The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the product.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the absolute 3D configuration is preserved. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change, which could invert the R/S designation.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral center are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid side), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side). The ester side has higher priority than the acid side.\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Transformation:** The ester group (Priority 1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group (Priority 2) is not reduced and forms the carbonyl part of the lactone.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** In the final lactone, the fragment from the original acid (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`) has a higher priority than the fragment from the original ester (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material becomes Priority 2 in the product, and the group that was Priority 2 becomes Priority 1. This swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The resulting isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate then cyclizes (via transesterification) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Transformation:** The acid group (Priority 2) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group (Priority 1) is not reduced and forms the carbonyl part of the lactone.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** The fragment from the original ester (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`) has a higher priority than the fragment from the original acid (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material becomes Priority 1 in the product. The group that was Priority 2 becomes Priority 2. The priority order is maintained, which results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3 and contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n**2. Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different reactivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid then cyclizes to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not change the physical 3D arrangement at the chiral center. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups changes, which would change the R/S designation.\n    *   **In the starting material:** The groups on the chiral carbon are H, Ethyl, `-CH₂COOiBu`, and `-CH₂COOH`. The `-CH₂COOiBu` group has higher priority than the `-CH₂COOH` group.\n    *   **In the product:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group has been reduced to become part of the `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment of the lactone ring. The `-CH₂COOH` group has become the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment. The `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment now has higher priority.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main groups attached to the chiral center have swapped. This causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to get an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group at C1 to a primary alcohol. The ester at C5 is untouched. The resulting 5-hydroxy ester then undergoes transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We check the CIP priorities again.\n    *   **In the starting material:** Priority is `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   **In the product:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group becomes the higher-priority `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment. The `-CH₂COOH` group is reduced and becomes the lower-priority `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the main groups is **retained**.\n    *   Therefore, to get an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must also be **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the selectivity of the reducing agents.\n# LiBH4 selectively reduces esters over carboxylic acids.\n# BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze Reaction A: A + LiBH4 -> (R)-lactone.\n# LiBH4 reduces the ester group.

This molecule has the following structure:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n    It contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at the other. It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which bears the ethyl group.\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone.\n    This lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The chiral center at C3 of the acid becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the different reactivities of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does **not** typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group of starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged. The resulting intermediate, `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, then cyclizes under acidic conditions to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which can change.\n    *   **In the starting material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are -H, -CH₂CH₃, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    *   **In the product (lactone):** The ester arm has been reduced to an alcohol and is now part of the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` ring fragment. The acid arm is now part of the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` ring fragment. The `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` fragment now has a higher priority than the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material becomes priority #2 in the product, and the group that was priority #2 becomes priority #1. This swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (B + BH₃)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group of starting material B to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged. The resulting intermediate, `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`, then undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority (Priority #1) than the acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`) (Priority #2).\n    *   **In the product (lactone):** The ester arm becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` fragment, which is Priority #1. The acid arm is reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment, which is Priority #2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the main substituents is preserved (Priority #1 remains Priority #1, and Priority #2 remains Priority #2). Therefore, the R/S designation is **retained**.\n    *   To obtain the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at the other.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(Et)(*)-CH₂(b)-COOiBu`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which corresponds to the C3 chiral center of the starting material.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemical Consequences (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThe absolute configuration (the 3D arrangement of atoms) at the chiral center is not changed by these reactions. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester side) - Highest priority\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid side) - Second priority\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority\n    *(The ester side is higher priority than the acid side because the chain ends in -O-C(isobutyl) vs. -O-H)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The four groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - Highest priority\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - Second priority\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority\n\n### **4. Trace Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The ester side (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, Priority 1 in the start) is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the ether-oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`, Priority 2 in the product).\n    *   The acid side (`-CH₂-COOH`, Priority 2 in the start) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`, Priority 1 in the product).\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). Swapping two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   The ester side (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, Priority 1 in the start) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`, Priority 1 in the product).\n    *   The acid side (`-CH₂-COOH`, Priority 2 in the start) is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the ether-oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`, Priority 2 in the product).\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is preserved (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). The reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the different chemical selectivities of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), when reacting with a starting material that contains both a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOR) functional group.\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols. It does not typically reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:**\n    1.  Based on its selectivity, LiBH₄ reduces the **ester group** of starting material A to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) then causes an intramolecular reaction (lactonization) to form the final six-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral carbon are -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH (acid arm), and -CH₂COOiBu (ester arm). The ester arm has a higher CIP priority than the acid arm.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The ester arm is reduced to an alcohol arm (-CH₂CH₂OH). Now, the acid arm (-CH₂COOH) has a higher CIP priority than the new alcohol arm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main substituent groups have swapped. This swap results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:**\n    1.  Based on its selectivity, BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid group** of starting material B to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The ester group remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) then causes an intramolecular reaction (transesterification) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** The ester arm has a higher priority than the acid arm.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The acid arm is reduced to an alcohol arm (-CH₂CH₂OH). The ester arm remains the highest priority substituent (after the implicit hydrogen).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the main substituent groups is **preserved**. This means the stereochemical designation is **retained** (R remains R, and S remains S).\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### **Core Principles**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** The key to this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOR`) functional group.\n    *   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)** selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Borane (BH₃)** selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules:** The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the absolute three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center according to CIP rules.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. The chiral center is C3, which is attached to H, an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), a carboxymethyl group (`-CH₂COOH`), and an isobutoxycarbonylmethyl group (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   **CIP Priorities in Starting Material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority)\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, priority #1) to a primary alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, priority #2) is unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   The original priority #1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The original priority #2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) remains.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy acid, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has a higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   This means the priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center leads to an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reaction Pathway:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, priority #2) to a primary alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, priority #1) is unchanged. The resulting isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate then cyclizes to the lactone.\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   The original priority #1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains the highest priority group.\n    *   The original priority #2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`, which is still higher priority than the ethyl group.\n    *   The priority ranking of the substituents (`-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃`) is preserved.\n    *   Since the priority order does not change, the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration. Therefore, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents and a rigorous determination of the stereochemical outcome of each reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which bears the ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which corresponds to the C3 carbon of the starting material. This lactone is formed from the cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents\n\nThe key to this problem is that the two reducing agents target different functional groups.\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate then cyclizes to the lactone under acidic conditions.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** While the reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    1.  **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid group), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester group). The ester group has a higher priority than the acid group.\n        *   Priority Order: `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n    2.  **Priorities in Product:** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original acid group), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original ester group). The `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` fragment has higher priority.\n        *   Priority Order: `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (P'1) > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P'2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P'3) > `-H` (P'4).\n    3.  **Mapping the Change:** In this reaction, the ester group (P1) is reduced and becomes the lower priority ring fragment (P'2). The acid group (P2) becomes the higher priority ring fragment (P'1). Since the priorities of the top two groups are swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting 5-hydroxy-isobutyl-ester intermediate then undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We use the same priority analysis as above.\n    1.  **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A. `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2).\n    2.  **Priorities in Product:** Same as before. `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (P'1) > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P'2).\n    3.  **Mapping the Change:** In this reaction, the ester group (P1) is untouched and becomes the higher priority ring fragment (P'1). The acid group (P2) is reduced and becomes the lower priority ring fragment (P'2). The priority order of the main substituents is **preserved** (P1 → P'1, P2 → P'2).\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the priority order is maintained, the R/S designation is **retained**. To obtain an (S)-product, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration. Therefore, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the same enantiomer.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1.

The R/S designation is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, a careful analysis of each reaction is required, focusing on two key aspects: the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical outcome.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon 3.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon 4, which corresponds to carbon 3 of the starting material. The reactions do not break any bonds at this chiral center, so its absolute three-dimensional configuration is preserved.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We must determine if the R/S designation changes. This requires comparing the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups on the chiral center before and after the reaction.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups on the chiral carbon are -H, -CH₂CH₃, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The ester-containing group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid-containing group (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    *   **Product:** The groups on the chiral carbon are -H, -CH₂CH₃, `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original ester). The fragment from the original acid now has a higher priority than the fragment from the original ester.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main side chains are swapped during the reaction. This causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation (e.g., an S starting material gives an R product).\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-lactone**, starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate then undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again compare the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** The priority order is the same as for A: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   **Product:** The priority order is the same as in the first reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** In this pathway, the higher-priority group in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the higher-priority fragment in the product (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`). The priority order is maintained. This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)-lactone**, starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Materials and Products**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which bears the ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n*   **Product:** The product of both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center in the product is at carbon 4, which corresponds to the chiral center at carbon 3 of the starting material.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different chemical selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid, which then cyclizes (lactonizes) under acidic conditions to form the product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** While the reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, we must analyze the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to see if the R/S designation changes.\n    *   **In the starting material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral carbon are -H, -CH₂CH₃, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The ester-containing side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid-containing side chain (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The ester group is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). Now, the acid-containing side chain (`-CH₂COOH`) has a higher priority than the new alcohol-containing side chain (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main side chains are swapped during the reaction. This swap causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester, which undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The priority order is the same as before: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The acid group is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester-containing side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains the highest priority group, and the new alcohol-containing side chain (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) is the second highest.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups is **retained** throughout the reaction. Therefore, the R/S designation is also retained. To obtain an (S)-product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Molecules**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with a chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which has an ethyl group attached. It contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOiBu(5)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\nBoth reactions involve a reduction of one carbonyl group to a primary alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) with the remaining carbonyl group to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Stereochemistry**\n\nWhile the reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (meaning the 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved), the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituents according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n\n**CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second priority)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H`\n\n**CIP Priorities in the Lactone Product:**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl)\n2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ring oxygen)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H`\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, priority #1 in A) to a primary alcohol. This alcohol becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment in the product (priority #2). The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂-COOH`, priority #2 in A) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` fragment in the product (priority #1).\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material becomes part of the priority #2 group in the product, and the group that was priority #2 becomes part of the priority #1 group. This swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion:** To obtain an **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂-COOH`, priority #2 in B) to a primary alcohol. This alcohol becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment in the product (priority #2). The ester group (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, priority #1 in B) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` fragment in the product (priority #1).\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material becomes part of the priority #1 group in the product. The group that was priority #2 becomes part of the priority #2 group. The priority order is preserved. This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion:** To obtain an **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the absolute 3D configuration is preserved. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change, which could invert the R/S designation.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral center are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid side), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side). The ester side has higher priority than the acid side.\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Transformation:** The ester group (Priority 1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group (Priority 2) is not reduced and forms the carbonyl part of the lactone.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** In the final lactone, the fragment from the original acid (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`) has a higher priority than the fragment from the original ester (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material becomes Priority 2 in the product, and the group that was Priority 2 becomes Priority 1. This swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.

The ester group (Priority 1) is not reduced and forms the carbonyl part of the lactone.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** The fragment from the original ester (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`) has a higher priority than the fragment from the original acid (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material becomes Priority 1 in the product. The group that was Priority 2 becomes Priority 2. The priority order is maintained, which results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3 and contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n**2. Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different reactivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid then cyclizes to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not change the physical 3D arrangement at the chiral center. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups changes, which would change the R/S designation.\n    *   **In the starting material:** The groups on the chiral carbon are H, Ethyl, `-CH₂COOiBu`, and `-CH₂COOH`. The `-CH₂COOiBu` group has higher priority than the `-CH₂COOH` group.\n    *   **In the product:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group has been reduced to become part of the `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment of the lactone ring. The `-CH₂COOH` group has become the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment. The `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment now has higher priority.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main groups attached to the chiral center have swapped. This causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to get an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group at C1 to a primary alcohol. The ester at C5 is untouched. The resulting 5-hydroxy ester then undergoes transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We check the CIP priorities again.\n    *   **In the starting material:** Priority is `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   **In the product:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group becomes the higher-priority `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment. The `-CH₂COOH` group is reduced and becomes the lower-priority `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the main groups is **retained**.\n    *   Therefore, to get an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must also be **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the selectivity of the reducing agents.\n# LiBH4 selectively reduces esters over carboxylic acids.\n# BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze Reaction A: A + LiBH4 -> (R)-lactone.\n# LiBH4 reduces the ester group.

This molecule has the following structure:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n    It contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at the other. It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which bears the ethyl group.\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone.\n    This lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The chiral center at C3 of the acid becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the different reactivities of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does **not** typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group of starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged. The resulting intermediate, `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, then cyclizes under acidic conditions to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the absolute 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which can change.\n    *   **In the starting material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are -H, -CH₂CH₃, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    *   **In the product (lactone):** The ester arm has been reduced to an alcohol and is now part of the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` ring fragment. The acid arm is now part of the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` ring fragment. The `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` fragment now has a higher priority than the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material becomes priority #2 in the product, and the group that was priority #2 becomes priority #1. This swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (B + BH₃)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group of starting material B to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged. The resulting intermediate, `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`, then undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority (Priority #1) than the acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`) (Priority #2).\n    *   **In the product (lactone):** The ester arm becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` fragment, which is Priority #1. The acid arm is reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment, which is Priority #2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the main substituents is preserved (Priority #1 remains Priority #1, and Priority #2 remains Priority #2). Therefore, the R/S designation is **retained**.\n    *   To obtain the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at the other.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(Et)(*)-CH₂(b)-COOiBu`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which corresponds to the C3 chiral center of the starting material.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemical Consequences (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThe absolute configuration (the 3D arrangement of atoms) at the chiral center is not changed by these reactions. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Ester side) - Highest priority\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Acid side) - Second priority\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority\n    *(The ester side is higher priority than the acid side because the chain ends in -O-C(isobutyl) vs. -O-H)*\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):** The four groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl) - Highest priority\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ether oxygen) - Second priority\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group) - Third priority\n    4.  `-H` - Lowest priority\n\n### **4. Trace Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   The ester side (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, Priority 1 in the start) is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the ether-oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`, Priority 2 in the product).\n    *   The acid side (`-CH₂-COOH`, Priority 2 in the start) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`, Priority 1 in the product).\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (P1 → P'2 and P2 → P'1). Swapping two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   The ester side (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, Priority 1 in the start) is not reduced and becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`, Priority 1 in the product).\n    *   The acid side (`-CH₂-COOH`, Priority 2 in the start) is reduced to an alcohol, becoming the ether-oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`, Priority 2 in the product).\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is preserved (P1 → P'1 and P2 → P'2). The reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the different chemical selectivities of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), when reacting with a starting material that contains both a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOR) functional group.\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols. It does not typically reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:**\n    1.  Based on its selectivity, LiBH₄ reduces the **ester group** of starting material A to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) then causes an intramolecular reaction (lactonization) to form the final six-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral carbon are -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH (acid arm), and -CH₂COOiBu (ester arm). The ester arm has a higher CIP priority than the acid arm.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The ester arm is reduced to an alcohol arm (-CH₂CH₂OH). Now, the acid arm (-CH₂COOH) has a higher CIP priority than the new alcohol arm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main substituent groups have swapped. This swap results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:**\n    1.  Based on its selectivity, BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid group** of starting material B to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The ester group remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) then causes an intramolecular reaction (transesterification) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** The ester arm has a higher priority than the acid arm.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The acid arm is reduced to an alcohol arm (-CH₂CH₂OH). The ester arm remains the highest priority substituent (after the implicit hydrogen).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the main substituent groups is **preserved**. This means the stereochemical designation is **retained** (R remains R, and S remains S).\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### **Core Principles**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** The key to this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOR`) functional group.\n    *   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)** selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Borane (BH₃)** selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules:** The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the absolute three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center according to CIP rules.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. The chiral center is C3, which is attached to H, an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), a carboxymethyl group (`-CH₂COOH`), and an isobutoxycarbonylmethyl group (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   **CIP Priorities in Starting Material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority)\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, priority #1) to a primary alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, priority #2) is unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   The original priority #1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The original priority #2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) remains.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy acid, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has a higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   This means the priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center leads to an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reaction Pathway:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, priority #2) to a primary alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, priority #1) is unchanged. The resulting isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate then cyclizes to the lactone.\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   The original priority #1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains the highest priority group.\n    *   The original priority #2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`, which is still higher priority than the ethyl group.\n    *   The priority ranking of the substituents (`-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃`) is preserved.\n    *   Since the priority order does not change, the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration. Therefore, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents and a rigorous determination of the stereochemical outcome of each reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which bears the ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which corresponds to the C3 carbon of the starting material. This lactone is formed from the cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents\n\nThe key to this problem is that the two reducing agents target different functional groups.\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate then cyclizes to the lactone under acidic conditions.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** While the reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    1.  **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid group), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester group). The ester group has a higher priority than the acid group.\n        *   Priority Order: `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n    2.  **Priorities in Product:** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original acid group), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original ester group). The `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` fragment has higher priority.\n        *   Priority Order: `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (P'1) > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P'2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P'3) > `-H` (P'4).\n    3.  **Mapping the Change:** In this reaction, the ester group (P1) is reduced and becomes the lower priority ring fragment (P'2). The acid group (P2) becomes the higher priority ring fragment (P'1). Since the priorities of the top two groups are swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting 5-hydroxy-isobutyl-ester intermediate then undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We use the same priority analysis as above.\n    1.  **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A. `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2).\n    2.  **Priorities in Product:** Same as before. `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (P'1) > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P'2).\n    3.  **Mapping the Change:** In this reaction, the ester group (P1) is untouched and becomes the higher priority ring fragment (P'1). The acid group (P2) is reduced and becomes the lower priority ring fragment (P'2). The priority order of the main substituents is **preserved** (P1 → P'1, P2 → P'2).\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the priority order is maintained, the R/S designation is **retained**. To obtain an (S)-product, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration. Therefore, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the same enantiomer.\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1.

Therefore, to obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester, which undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The priority order is the same as before: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The acid group is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester-containing side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains the highest priority group, and the new alcohol-containing side chain (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) is the second highest.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups is **retained** throughout the reaction. Therefore, the R/S designation is also retained. To obtain an (S)-product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Molecules**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with a chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which has an ethyl group attached. It contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOiBu(5)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\nBoth reactions involve a reduction of one carbonyl group to a primary alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) with the remaining carbonyl group to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Stereochemistry**\n\nWhile the reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (meaning the 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved), the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituents according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n\n**CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second priority)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H`\n\n**CIP Priorities in the Lactone Product:**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (Ring fragment towards the carbonyl)\n2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Ring fragment towards the ring oxygen)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H`\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, priority #1 in A) to a primary alcohol. This alcohol becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment in the product (priority #2). The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂-COOH`, priority #2 in A) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` fragment in the product (priority #1).\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material becomes part of the priority #2 group in the product, and the group that was priority #2 becomes part of the priority #1 group. This swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion:** To obtain an **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂-COOH`, priority #2 in B) to a primary alcohol. This alcohol becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` fragment in the product (priority #2). The ester group (`-CH₂-COOiBu`, priority #1 in B) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` fragment in the product (priority #1).\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material becomes part of the priority #1 group in the product. The group that was priority #2 becomes part of the priority #2 group. The priority order is preserved. This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n3.  **Conclusion:** To obtain an **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
