Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:** We are given two conditions for the fragment masses, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive):\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Solve for Masses:** Substitute the first relation into the second:\n    `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n    `3m₂ = 0.99M`\n    `m₂ = 0.33M`\n    From this, we find `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n*   **Calculate Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    `T₁_class / T₂_class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n    This means `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   **Solve for T₁_class:**\n    `T₁_class + T₂_class = Q = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_class = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate their squared values:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   **Solve for T₁:** We know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies (in GeV) into the equation:\n    `T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most of them performed the calculation correctly to arrive at 5 MeV, many made an error in selecting the corresponding letter option. The physics and mathematics consistently point to 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy:** `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment mass relationships:** We are given `m1 = 2 * m2` (where `m1` is the more massive fragment) and `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Solve for individual masses:**\n    *   Substitute the first relation into the second: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Therefore, `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n    *   And `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   **Calculate rest-mass energies:**\n    *   `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2 = p`) due to the conservation of momentum.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This implies `p² = 2 * m * T`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal: `2 * m1 * T1_class = 2 * m2 * T2_class`, which simplifies to `m1 * T1_class = m2 * T2_class`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_class / T2_class = m2 / m1 = 1/2`. So, `T2_class = 2 * T1_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_class + T2_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T2_class`: `T1_class + 2 * T1_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_class = 3 GeV`, which means `T1_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\nWe again use the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`), but with the relativistic formula for momentum.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be rearranged to `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since total energy `E = T + mc²`, this becomes `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Equating the momenta of the two fragments: `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n*   `T1² + 2*T1*m1c² = T2² + 2*T2*m2c²`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1c² = 198 GeV`, `m2c² = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`.\n*   `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`.\n*   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n*   `600*T1 = 603`.\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first verify the calculations presented by the different agents to find the correct numerical answer. I will perform the calculation step-by-step, ensuring each stage is correct.\n\n1.  **Calculate Fragment Properties:** I will determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m1c^2` and `m2c^2`) based on the given relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`).\n2.  **Calculate Q-value:** I will find the total kinetic energy released (`Q`) by calculating the mass defect (`Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`).\n3.  **Calculate Classical T1:** I will calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) using the non-relativistic approximation, where kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to mass (`T1/T2 = m2/m1`).\n4.  **Calculate Relativistic T1:** I will calculate the correct `T1` using the relativistic energy-momentum relation (`E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`) and the conservation of energy and momentum.\n5.  **Find the Difference:** I will compute the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T1` and convert it to MeV.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option:** Finally, I will match the calculated numerical result to the given multiple-choice options (A: 20 MeV, B: 2 MeV, C: 10 MeV, D: 5 MeV).\n\nAfter this analysis, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial values\nE_M_GeV = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n# We are given:\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# Substituting the first into the second: 2*m2 + m2 = 0.99*M => 3*m2 = 0.99*M\n# So, m2 = 0.33 * M and m1 = 0.66 * M.\n# In terms of energy:\nm1c2_GeV = 0.66 * E_M_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = 0.33 * E_M_GeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# Q is the energy released from the mass defect.\nQ_GeV = E_M_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n# In classical mechanics, for a decay from rest, momentum is conserved (p1=p2).\n# T = p^2 / (2m), so T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2.\n# T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n# Since T1_classical + T2_classical = Q, we have T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = Q.\n# 3 * T1_classical = Q\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / 3.0\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n# In relativistic mechanics, we conserve total energy and momentum.\n# Conservation of total energy: E1 + E2 = E_M_GeV\n# Conservation of momentum (p1=p2) leads to: E1^2 - (m1c2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c2)^2\n# (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2\n# (E1 - E2) * E_M_GeV = m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2\n# E1 - E2 = (m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2) / E_M_GeV\nE1_minus_E2 = (m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2) / E_M_GeV\n# Now we have a system of two linear equations:\n# 1) E1 + E2 = E_M_GeV\n# 2) E1 - E2 = E1_minus_E2\n# Adding them together: 2*E1 = E_M_GeV + E1_minus_E2\nE1_GeV = (E_M_GeV + E1_minus_E2) / 2.0\n# The kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1c2.\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2_GeV\n\n# Step 6: Find the difference and convert to MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The classical kinetic energy T1 is {T1_classical_GeV * 1000:.1f} MeV.\")\nprint(f\"The correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 is {T1_relativistic_GeV * 1000:.1f} MeV.\")\nprint(f\"The difference between the two values is {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV.\")\nprint(\"The options are: A) 20 MeV, B) 2 MeV, C) 10 MeV, D) 5 MeV.\")\nprint(\"The calculated difference of 5.0 MeV corresponds to option D.\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 55\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Problem Statement and Extract Key Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments.\n    *   Fragment masses: `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2` (where `m1` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of final rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Goal:** Find the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_rel`) and the kinetic energy calculated using the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n    *   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_cl`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations relating the masses. We can express these in terms of rest-mass energies:\n1.  `m1c² = 2 * m2c²`\n2.  `m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * Mc²`\n\nSubstitute the value of `Mc² = 300 GeV` into the second equation:\n`m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nNow, substitute the first equation into this result:\n`2 * m2c² + m2c² = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2c² = 297 GeV`\n`m2c² = 99 GeV`\n\nUsing this, we find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m1c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q = T1 + T2`).\n`Q = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the classical momentum be `p_cl`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a relationship between the kinetic energies:\n    *   `p_cl² = 2 * m1 * T1_cl`\n    *   `p_cl² = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`\n    *   Therefore, `m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Now, use the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1_cl + T2_cl = Q = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite. Let the magnitude be `p_rel`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   **Total Energy:** `E = T + mc²`. Substituting this gives `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`:\n    *   `T1² + 2*T1*(m1c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (`m1c² = 198 GeV`, `m2c² = 99 GeV`) and the relation `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`:\n    *   `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `T1`:\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy: `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values.\n*   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_cl`\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result matches option A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents performed the calculation correctly to arrive at 5 MeV, many made an error in selecting the final option letter. The correct calculation consistently yields 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   `m₁` is the more massive fragment, with `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses. We can solve this in terms of their rest-mass energies (`E = mc²`):\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc²`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (300 GeV)`\n`3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for each fragment.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a ratio of kinetic energies:\n    `T₁_class / T₂_class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\n    Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`.\n    This means `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_class:** We know the total kinetic energy is `Q = 3 GeV`.\n    `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_class = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** The total energy is also conserved. The initial total energy was `Mc²`. The final total energy is `E₁ + E₂`.\n    `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for Energies:** Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\n    `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n    `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for `E₁` and `E₂`:\n    1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations gives `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_rel:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    `T₁_rel = E₁ - m₁c²`\n    `T₁_rel = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value.\n`Difference = T₁_rel - T₁_class`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem and Common Steps**\n\nAll the detailed solutions follow a consistent and correct physical and mathematical procedure. The core steps are:\n1.  **Determine Fragment Properties:** Calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`) based on the given relationships.\n2.  **Calculate Q-value:** Find the total kinetic energy (`Q`) released in the fission, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n3.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (`T₁_classical`):** Use non-relativistic conservation of momentum (`p = mv`) to find how the Q-value is distributed and calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n4.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (`T₁_correct`):** Use relativistic conservation of energy and momentum (`E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`) to find the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n5.  **Find the Difference:** Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical results and convert it to MeV.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation Verification**\n\nLet's verify the calculation performed by the agents.\n\n*   **Step 1: Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Given `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    *   Solving this system gives `m₁ = 0.66M` and `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n    *   This step is unanimously agreed upon and correct.\n\n*   **Step 2: Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy)**\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This step is also unanimously agreed upon and correct.\n\n*   **Step 3: Classical Kinetic Energy (`T₁_classical`)**\n    *   From conservation of momentum, `p₁ = p₂`. In classical mechanics, `p²/2m₁ = T₁` and `p²/2m₂ = T₂`.\n    *   This leads to `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`, so `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n    *   Since `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`, we have `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3T₁ = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n    *   This calculation is correct and agreed upon by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 4: Relativistic Kinetic Energy (`T₁_correct`)**\n    *   From relativistic momentum conservation, `p₁ = p₂`. The relativistic relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    *   Therefore, `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`:\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This calculation is also correct and consistent across all detailed solutions.\n\n*   **Step 5: The Difference**\n    *   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Converting to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **3. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a difference of **5 MeV**. The candidate answers show some confusion in mapping this result to the correct letter option (A, B, C, or D), likely due to variations in the options presented to them.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Masses:** We are given two conditions for the fragment rest-masses, `m₁` and `m₂`:\n    1.  `m₁ = 2m₂` (one is twice as massive as the other).\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M` (the sum of their masses is 99% of the original).\n*   **Solving for Fragment Energies:** We can solve this system of equations in terms of energy.\n    *   From (1), `m₁c² = 2m₂c²`.\n    *   From (2), `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute the first energy equation into the second: `2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This gives `3m₂c² = 297 GeV`, so `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The more massive fragment's rest-mass energy is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** From the formula, `T₁/T₂ = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂/m₁`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, we have `T₁/T₂ = 1/2`, which means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We use the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂ = 2T₁` gives `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3T₁ = 3 GeV`, so `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between a particle's total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁` (all in GeV).\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The difference is the correct value minus the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Convert to MeV:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses. We can solve for them in terms of M:\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the second equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  Solve for `m₂`: `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  Solve for `m₁`: `m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies using the initial value `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\nThe energy released during the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nDue to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a ratio: `T₁_class / T₂_class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`, which means `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`**.\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rearranged to express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Since `E = T + mc²` (total energy = kinetic energy + rest-mass energy), we can write `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Because the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding both sides:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then group the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **`T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Extract Key Information**\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest, so its momentum is zero.\n*   It fissions into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n*   Sum of final rest-masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   The goal is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated relativistically (the correct value) and classically (the approximation).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nFrom this, we find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNow, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies using the initial value `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released during fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   Therefore, `T₁_class = p² / (2m₁)` and `T₂_class = p² / (2m₂)`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is `T₁_class / T₂_class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV` => `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Method**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite, `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies (in GeV):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. Combine the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   `T₁_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T₁_rel - T₁_class`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n**7. Convert to MeV**\nSince 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis result matches the calculation of the majority of the provided answers, even though many of them selected the wrong letter option. The correct value is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Define Variables**\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n*   It fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   `m₁` is the more massive fragment: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   The sum of the final rest-masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   `T₁` is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`).\n*   The goal is to find the difference: `T₁ (correct) - T₁ (classical)`.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`). We have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during fission (Q-value) is the mass that was converted into energy. This becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the classical momentum be `p_cl`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a relationship between the kinetic energies: `p_cl² = 2m₁T₁,cl = 2m₂T₂,cl`.\n*   Therefore, `m₁T₁,cl = m₂T₂,cl`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,cl / T₂,cl = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂,cl = 2T₁,cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁,cl + T₂,cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T₂,cl`: `T₁,cl + 2T₁,cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3T₁,cl = 3 GeV`, so `T₁,cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5.

Let the magnitude be `p_rel`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rearranged to solve for momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   We can also express momentum in terms of kinetic energy `T`, since `E = T + mc²`: `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and solve for `T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n    (The `T₁²` terms cancel out)\n    `396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6.

Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Method**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`. This leads to the following expression for momentum: `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\n*   **Equating Momenta:**\n    Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate their squared values:\n    `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    We substitute the known values: `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n    The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct steps from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m1`, is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses. We can solve this for their rest-mass energies (`mc^2`).\n1.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`\n2.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let `p_cl` be the magnitude of the classical momentum.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From `p_cl^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_cl` and `p_cl^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`, we get `m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T2_cl`: `T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`, so `T1_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite (`p1 = p2`).\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. This can be rearranged to express momentum in terms of kinetic energy `T`: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can set the expressions for `(pc)^2` for each fragment equal to each other:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1` (all in GeV).\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option C. A majority of the provided answers that show detailed work arrive at this numerical result, even if some of them select the wrong final letter. The physics and mathematics are sound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Setup\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Since it is at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`. The fragment `m₁` is the more massive one.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Goal:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### 2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\nFrom the given conditions:\n*   Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`:\n    `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n    `3m₂ = 0.99M`\n    `m₂ = 0.33M`\n*   This implies `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, we convert these masses to their corresponding rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released during the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`). This is calculated from the mass defect:\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   From this, we can relate their kinetic energies: `p² = 2m₁T₁_class = 2m₂T₂_class`.\n*   This gives the ratio: `T₁_class / T₂_class = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2T₁_class = 3 GeV`, which means `3T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **`T₁_class = 1 GeV`**.\n\n### 4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `p₁ = p₂ = p`, which means `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   We can express `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Equating the momenta of the two fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We have a system of equations with `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`. Substituting these values (all in GeV):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **`T₁_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### 5. Final Difference Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_rel - T₁_class`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert this result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result matches option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most derive the correct numerical value of 5 MeV, they frequently fail to select the correct corresponding letter from the options. Answer 14 is a notable exception, correctly calculating the value and selecting the right option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem\n\nThe core task is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### 2. Calculation of Key Physical Quantities\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:**\n    *   `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    2.  This means `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n    3.  The rest-mass energies are:\n        *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    *   The energy released (`Q`) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁/T₂ = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`. This implies `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   `T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (`p₁ = p₂`):**\n    *   `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`.\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`.\n    *   Cancel the `T₁²` term from both sides: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`.\n    *   `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Final Difference Calculation\n\n*   **Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical**.\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly perform the calculations to arrive at a difference of 5 MeV, there is significant confusion in mapping this result to the correct multiple-choice letter. The correct calculation yields 5 MeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses. We can solve for their rest-mass energies (`mc²`):\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n\n*   `T₁,class = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂,class = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`\nThis means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rearranged to `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since the total energy `E = T + mc²`, we can write the momentum term as:\n`(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate their squared values:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nNow, substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:** We are given two conditions for the fragment masses, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive):\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Solve for Masses:** Substitute the first relation into the second:\n    `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n    `3m₂ = 0.99M`\n    `m₂ = 0.33M`\n    From this, we find `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n*   **Calculate Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2.

Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate their squared values:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   **Solve for T₁:** We know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies (in GeV) into the equation:\n    `T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**5.

The physics and mathematics consistently point to 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy:** `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment mass relationships:** We are given `m1 = 2 * m2` (where `m1` is the more massive fragment) and `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Solve for individual masses:**\n    *   Substitute the first relation into the second: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Therefore, `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n    *   And `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   **Calculate rest-mass energies:**\n    *   `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2 = p`) due to the conservation of momentum.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This implies `p² = 2 * m * T`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal: `2 * m1 * T1_class = 2 * m2 * T2_class`, which simplifies to `m1 * T1_class = m2 * T2_class`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_class / T2_class = m2 / m1 = 1/2`. So, `T2_class = 2 * T1_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_class + T2_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T2_class`: `T1_class + 2 * T1_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_class = 3 GeV`, which means `T1_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\nWe again use the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`), but with the relativistic formula for momentum.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be rearranged to `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since total energy `E = T + mc²`, this becomes `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Equating the momenta of the two fragments: `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n*   `T1² + 2*T1*m1c² = T2² + 2*T2*m2c²`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1c² = 198 GeV`, `m2c² = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`.\n*   `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`.\n*   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n*   `600*T1 = 603`.\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first verify the calculations presented by the different agents to find the correct numerical answer.

Analyze the Problem Statement and Extract Key Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments.\n    *   Fragment masses: `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2` (where `m1` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of final rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Goal:** Find the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_rel`) and the kinetic energy calculated using the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n    *   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_cl`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations relating the masses. We can express these in terms of rest-mass energies:\n1.  `m1c² = 2 * m2c²`\n2.  `m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * Mc²`\n\nSubstitute the value of `Mc² = 300 GeV` into the second equation:\n`m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nNow, substitute the first equation into this result:\n`2 * m2c² + m2c² = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2c² = 297 GeV`\n`m2c² = 99 GeV`\n\nUsing this, we find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m1c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q = T1 + T2`).\n`Q = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the classical momentum be `p_cl`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a relationship between the kinetic energies:\n    *   `p_cl² = 2 * m1 * T1_cl`\n    *   `p_cl² = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`\n    *   Therefore, `m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Now, use the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1_cl + T2_cl = Q = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite. Let the magnitude be `p_rel`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   **Total Energy:** `E = T + mc²`. Substituting this gives `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`:\n    *   `T1² + 2*T1*(m1c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (`m1c² = 198 GeV`, `m2c² = 99 GeV`) and the relation `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`:\n    *   `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `T1`:\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy: `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values.\n*   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_cl`\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result matches option A.

The correct calculation consistently yields 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   `m₁` is the more massive fragment, with `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses. We can solve this in terms of their rest-mass energies (`E = mc²`):\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc²`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (300 GeV)`\n`3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for each fragment.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a ratio of kinetic energies:\n    `T₁_class / T₂_class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\n    Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`.\n    This means `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_class:** We know the total kinetic energy is `Q = 3 GeV`.\n    `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_class = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** The total energy is also conserved. The initial total energy was `Mc²`. The final total energy is `E₁ + E₂`.\n    `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for Energies:** Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\n    `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n    `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for `E₁` and `E₂`:\n    1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations gives `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_rel:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    `T₁_rel = E₁ - m₁c²`\n    `T₁_rel = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6.

In classical mechanics, `p²/2m₁ = T₁` and `p²/2m₂ = T₂`.\n    *   This leads to `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`, so `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n    *   Since `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`, we have `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3T₁ = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n    *   This calculation is correct and agreed upon by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 4: Relativistic Kinetic Energy (`T₁_correct`)**\n    *   From relativistic momentum conservation, `p₁ = p₂`. The relativistic relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    *   Therefore, `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`:\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This calculation is also correct and consistent across all detailed solutions.\n\n*   **Step 5: The Difference**\n    *   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Converting to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **3. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a difference of **5 MeV**. The candidate answers show some confusion in mapping this result to the correct letter option (A, B, C, or D), likely due to variations in the options presented to them.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Masses:** We are given two conditions for the fragment rest-masses, `m₁` and `m₂`:\n    1.  `m₁ = 2m₂` (one is twice as massive as the other).\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M` (the sum of their masses is 99% of the original).\n*   **Solving for Fragment Energies:** We can solve this system of equations in terms of energy.\n    *   From (1), `m₁c² = 2m₂c²`.\n    *   From (2), `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute the first energy equation into the second: `2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This gives `3m₂c² = 297 GeV`, so `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The more massive fragment's rest-mass energy is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** From the formula, `T₁/T₂ = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂/m₁`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, we have `T₁/T₂ = 1/2`, which means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We use the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂ = 2T₁` gives `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3T₁ = 3 GeV`, so `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between a particle's total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁` (all in GeV).\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The difference is the correct value minus the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Convert to MeV:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses. We can solve for them in terms of M:\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the second equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  Solve for `m₂`: `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  Solve for `m₁`: `m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies using the initial value `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\nThe energy released during the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nDue to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a ratio: `T₁_class / T₂_class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`, which means `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`**.\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rearranged to express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Since `E = T + mc²` (total energy = kinetic energy + rest-mass energy), we can write `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Because the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding both sides:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then group the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **`T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Extract Key Information**\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest, so its momentum is zero.\n*   It fissions into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n*   Sum of final rest-masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   The goal is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated relativistically (the correct value) and classically (the approximation).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nFrom this, we find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNow, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies using the initial value `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released during fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   Therefore, `T₁_class = p² / (2m₁)` and `T₂_class = p² / (2m₂)`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is `T₁_class / T₂_class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV` => `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Method**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite, `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies (in GeV):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. Combine the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   `T₁_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T₁_rel - T₁_class`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n**7. Convert to MeV**\nSince 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis result matches the calculation of the majority of the provided answers, even though many of them selected the wrong letter option.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`). We have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during fission (Q-value) is the mass that was converted into energy. This becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the classical momentum be `p_cl`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we can establish a relationship between the kinetic energies: `p_cl² = 2m₁T₁,cl = 2m₂T₂,cl`.\n*   Therefore, `m₁T₁,cl = m₂T₂,cl`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,cl / T₂,cl = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂,cl = 2T₁,cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁,cl + T₂,cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T₂,cl`: `T₁,cl + 2T₁,cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3T₁,cl = 3 GeV`, so `T₁,cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5.

The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`. This leads to the following expression for momentum: `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\n*   **Equating Momenta:**\n    Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate their squared values:\n    `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    We substitute the known values: `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\n    The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct steps from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m1`, is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses. We can solve this for their rest-mass energies (`mc^2`).\n1.  `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`\n2.  `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m2c^2 + m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let `p_cl` be the magnitude of the classical momentum.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From `p_cl^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_cl` and `p_cl^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`, we get `m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T2_cl`: `T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`, so `T1_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite (`p1 = p2`).\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. This can be rearranged to express momentum in terms of kinetic energy `T`: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can set the expressions for `(pc)^2` for each fragment equal to each other:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1` (all in GeV).\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option C. A majority of the provided answers that show detailed work arrive at this numerical result, even if some of them select the wrong final letter. The physics and mathematics are sound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Setup\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Since it is at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`. The fragment `m₁` is the more massive one.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Goal:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### 2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\nFrom the given conditions:\n*   Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`:\n    `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n    `3m₂ = 0.99M`\n    `m₂ = 0.33M`\n*   This implies `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, we convert these masses to their corresponding rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released during the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`). This is calculated from the mass defect:\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   From this, we can relate their kinetic energies: `p² = 2m₁T₁_class = 2m₂T₂_class`.\n*   This gives the ratio: `T₁_class / T₂_class = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2T₁_class = 3 GeV`, which means `3T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **`T₁_class = 1 GeV`**.\n\n### 4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `p₁ = p₂ = p`, which means `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   We can express `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Equating the momenta of the two fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We have a system of equations with `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`. Substituting these values (all in GeV):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **`T₁_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### 5. Final Difference Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_rel - T₁_class`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert this result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result matches option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most derive the correct numerical value of 5 MeV, they frequently fail to select the correct corresponding letter from the options. Answer 14 is a notable exception, correctly calculating the value and selecting the right option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem\n\nThe core task is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### 2. Calculation of Key Physical Quantities\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:**\n    *   `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    2.  This means `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n    3.  The rest-mass energies are:\n        *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):**\n    *   The energy released (`Q`) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁/T₂ = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`. This implies `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   `T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (`p₁ = p₂`):**\n    *   `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`.\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`.\n    *   Cancel the `T₁²` term from both sides: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`.\n    *   `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Final Difference Calculation\n\n*   **Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical**.\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly perform the calculations to arrive at a difference of 5 MeV, there is significant confusion in mapping this result to the correct multiple-choice letter. The correct calculation yields 5 MeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses. We can solve for their rest-mass energies (`mc²`):\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n\n*   `T₁,class = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂,class = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`\nThis means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rearranged to `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since the total energy `E = T + mc²`, we can write the momentum term as:\n`(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate their squared values:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nNow, substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6.
