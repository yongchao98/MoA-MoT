Let's analyze the calculations to determine the correct pH values.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution\n\nFirst, we must account for the dilution of the acetic acid with water. The dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ is used for this.\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Concentration (M₂): (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acid remains. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base constitutes a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base]/\\[weak acid])\n*   **Calculate pKa:** pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Calculate pH:** At this point, the ratio of [conjugate base] to [weak acid] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water.\n\n1.  **Find the volume of NaOH needed:**\n    *   Moles of acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n2.  **Find the concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from hydrolysis:**\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Calculate the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] using the approximation [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [acetate]):\n        *   [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n        *   pOH = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and a pH of **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by breaking it down into two main parts, as requested by the question.\n\n1.  **Calculate the pH at 25% titration:**\n    *   First, I'll determine the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water.\n    *   Then, I'll use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`.\n    *   I will calculate the pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is 25/75, or 1/3.\n\n2.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point:**\n    *   At this point, all the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate.\n    *   I will calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach this point to find the total volume of the solution.\n    *   Then, I'll calculate the concentration of the acetate ion in this total volume.\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, so I'll calculate its Kb from the given Ka and Kw.\n    *   Using the Kb and the acetate concentration, I'll find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].\n    *   Finally, I'll calculate the pOH and convert it to pH using `pH = 14 - pOH`.\n\nI will implement these steps in Python to ensure accuracy and then compare the results to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the initial parameters and constants\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid_L = 0.02000  # L (20.00 cm3)\nvol_water_L = 0.02000 # L (20.00 cm3)\nconc_naoh = 0.1  # M\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution ---\n# The number of moles of acid does not change upon dilution\nmoles_acid = initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid_L\n\n# The new volume is the sum of the acid and water volumes\nfinal_vol_acid_L = initial_vol_acid_L + vol_water_L\n\n# The new concentration of the diluted acid\nconc_acid_diluted = moles_acid / final_vol_acid_L\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration ---\n# This is a buffer region, so we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\n# First, calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-] (conjugate base) to [HA] (acid) is 25/75 = 1/3\nratio_base_acid = 0.25 / 0.75\n\n# Calculate the pH\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_base_acid)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point ---\n# At the equivalence point, all acid has been converted to its conjugate base.\n# Moles of NaOH needed = moles of acid\nmoles_naoh_eq = moles_acid\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point\nvol_naoh_eq_L = moles_naoh_eq / conc_naoh\n\n# Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = final_vol_acid_L + vol_naoh_eq_L\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n\n# The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# We need the base dissociation constant, Kb\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-]\n# Kb = [HA][OH-] / [A-] => Kb = x^2 / (conc_acetate - x)\n# Since Kb is very small, we can approximate: x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n\n# Calculate pH from pOH (at 25 C, pH + pOH = 14)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Final Output ---\nprint(f\"The calculated pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing these results with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.73; 7.00\")\nprint(\"B) 3.17; 6.73\")\nprint(\"C) 4.57; 6.92\")\nprint(\"D) 4.26; 8.52\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option D.\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 73\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Volume of water added: 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume of the solution (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n    M₂ = (M₁ × V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   **Careful point:** The titration is performed on the diluted solution, so we must use this new concentration (0.025 M) for all subsequent calculations.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (acetic acid, HA) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base (acetate, A⁻). The remaining 75% is still in the acid form. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer solutions: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentrations (or moles) of the conjugate base to the acid is [A⁻]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the equation:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   **Careful point:** In the buffer region, the pH depends on the pKa and the ratio of conjugate base to acid. The absolute concentrations are less important as they cancel out in the ratio, but the ratio itself is key.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water.\n*   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acid (0.001 mol).\n*   Calculate the volume of NaOH added:\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] at this point:\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻. We need to find the [OH⁻].\n*   Calculate the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Set up the equilibrium expression: Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻] = [HA].\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x).\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n*   **Careful points:** Remember to calculate the total volume to find the correct concentration of the conjugate base. The pH at the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration will always be greater than 7 due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.

Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] ≈ x² / [A⁻]\n    *   x² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.020) = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH values are **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.

We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n**pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])**\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to acid:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   The ratio [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence:**\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.020 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an equilibrium calculation to find [OH⁻]:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.020\n        x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n        pOH = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.73; 7.00\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
