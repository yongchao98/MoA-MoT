The core of the problem is to find a self-consistent pair of values for the volume of acid and the final pH of a solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Process**\n\nTo dissolve the solid base Fe(OH)₃, a strong acid (H⁺) is added. The total amount of H⁺ added performs two distinct tasks:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction**: A certain amount of H⁺ is consumed in a neutralization reaction to dissolve the solid.\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance**: An additional, excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final solution to keep the pH acidic enough to prevent the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out.\n\nThe correct answer must be the option where the values for volume and pH satisfy this chemical reality. This can be checked using a mole balance equation, a method correctly identified by all the sound candidate answers.\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Acid Requirement**\n\nThis value is constant and is the foundation of the calculation.\n*   **Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** Using standard atomic weights (Fe=55.845, O=15.999, H=1.008), the molar mass is 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction:** Based on the 1:3 ratio in the chemical equation, the moles of H⁺ consumed (`n_reacted`) are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Set Up the Consistency Check (Mole Balance Equation)**\n\nFor any option to be correct, the following relationship must hold true:\n(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess)\n\nMathematically, this is:\n`(V_acid [in L] × 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)`\n\n**4. Systematically Test Each Option**\n\nWe will now test each option from the original question against this equation.\n\n*   **A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.0204 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.0204 L × 0.1 M = **0.00204 mol**.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is less than the `n_reacted` of 0.002807 mol. Not enough acid is added to even dissolve the solid completely.\n    *   **Result**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   **Analysis**: This amount is also slightly less than that required for the reaction (`n_reacted` ≈ 0.002807 mol). It is therefore impossible for this volume of acid to both dissolve the solid and create a strongly acidic pH of 2.04.\n    *   **Result**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **Total H⁺ Required by the System**:\n        *   `n_reacted` = 0.002807 mol\n        *   `n_excess` for pH = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol\n        *   Total Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   **Analysis**: The amount of H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match for the total amount required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor discrepancy (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values.\n    *   **Result**: **Correct and self-consistent.**\n\n*   **D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **Total H⁺ Required by the System**:\n        *   `n_reacted` = 0.002807 mol\n        *   `n_excess` for pH = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol\n        *   Total Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   **Analysis**: The amount of acid added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required by the system (0.002876 mol).\n    *   **Result**: Incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n1.  **Consensus on Method**: The vast majority of candidate answers correctly identify the two-part nature of the problem (stoichiometry + equilibrium) and use a mole balance check for verification.\n2.  **Consensus on Calculation**: The numerical calculations for `n_reacted` (~0.002807 mol) and the subsequent consistency check are overwhelmingly in agreement across all candidates. They all find that the pair {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} is the only one that works.\n3.  **Lettering Confusion**: The primary reason for different final letter choices among the candidates (e.g., A, B, C, or D) is inconsistent re-labeling of the options. However, the underlying analysis correctly identifies the same numerical answer in every case.\n4.  **Final Decision**: Based on a rigorous and consistent application of chemical principles, the only valid answer is the one where the amount of acid added matches the amount required for both reaction and the final pH. This is unequivocally the pair **pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**, which corresponds to option **C** in the provided question list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and verifying the logic from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Task and Method\n\nThe problem asks for a pair of values—acid volume and resulting pH—that are chemically self-consistent for dissolving a specific amount of Fe(OH)₃. As demonstrated by all the provided candidate answers, the most robust method to solve this is not to derive the values from scratch, but to test which of the given options satisfies the principles of stoichiometry and equilibrium.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the mole balance of the acid (H⁺ ions):\n`Total moles of H⁺ added` = `Moles of H⁺ consumed in reaction` + `Moles of H⁺ remaining in excess (to create the final pH)`\n\n### 2. Stoichiometric Calculation: Moles of H⁺ Consumed\n\nThis is a fixed quantity that all valid analyses must calculate correctly.\n\n*   **Chemical Reaction:** The neutralization of the base is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. This shows a 1:3 mole ratio between Fe(OH)₃ and the strong acid (H⁺).\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** M(Fe) + 3×M(O) + 3×M(H) ≈ 55.845 + 3(15.999) + 3(1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Given 0.1 g, the moles are: 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed (`n_reacted`):** Based on the 1:3 ratio, the moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction are 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\nAny valid answer must use a volume of acid that provides *at least* this many moles of H⁺.\n\n### 3. Consistency Check of Each Option\n\nNow, we must test each option from the original question against the mole balance equation. We will refer to the original lettering of the options.\n\n*   **Total H⁺ Added** = `0.1 M × Volume (L)`\n*   **H⁺ Remaining (Excess)** = `10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L`\n*   **Total H⁺ Required** = `0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1)`\n\n**A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required:** 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   **Analysis:** The moles added (0.003009) and the moles required (0.003011) are nearly identical (a difference of <0.1%, likely due to rounding). **This option is chemically self-consistent.**\n\n**B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Analysis:** This amount is slightly *less* than the 0.002807 mol required just to react with the solid. The Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. **This option is impossible.**\n\n**C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required:** 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + (0.000069 M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000007 = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   **Analysis:** The moles added (0.003214) do not match the moles required (0.002876). **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n*   **Analysis:** This amount is far less than the 0.002807 mol needed for the reaction. **This option is impossible.**\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe chemical and mathematical analysis overwhelmingly demonstrates that the only self-consistent pair of values is {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³}. These values correspond to option A in the original question's list.\n\nWhile the candidate answers showed considerable confusion in mapping the correct numerical answer to the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D), their underlying calculations correctly identified the same consistent pair of values.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points and correct methodology identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**1. Define the Chemical Process and the Core Principle**\nThe problem involves dissolving a solid base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), in a strong acid. The total amount of acid added must perform two distinct tasks:\n*   **Reaction:** An amount of H⁺ is stoichiometrically consumed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Equilibrium:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep the pH low, which prevents the dissolved iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) from re-precipitating as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe central principle to solve this problem is a mole balance. The correct answer choice must be self-consistent, meaning the total moles of H⁺ added must equal the moles of H⁺ consumed in the reaction plus the moles of H⁺ remaining in excess.\n\n**Equation**: Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ in Excess\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Reacted (Stoichiometric Requirement)**\nThis is a fixed quantity that forms the baseline for our analysis.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Balanced Chemical Reaction**:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Reacted**: The reaction stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Part B: Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\nNow we check which option's (Volume, pH) pair satisfies the mole balance equation. We can quickly eliminate options where the acid added is insufficient even for the reaction.\n\n*   **Acid needed for reaction**: 0.002807 mol.\n*   Volume needed for reaction = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L or **28.07 cm³**.\n*   Any option with a volume less than 28.07 cm³ is impossible.\n\n    *   **Option C (20.40 cm³)** and **Option D (28.05 cm³)** are therefore impossible, as they do not provide enough acid to even dissolve the solid. This allows us to confidently eliminate them.\n\nNow we only need to test options A and B.\n\n**Test Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required by the system**:\n    *   H⁺ for reaction = **0.002807 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ in excess for pH = [H⁺] × V_total = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ **0.000069 mol**.\n    *   Total Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   The amount added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required (0.002876 mol). This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added** (from the given volume):\n    0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required** (for reaction + final pH):\n    *   H⁺ for reaction = **0.002807 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ in excess for pH = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.000204 mol**.\n    *   Total Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   The amount of H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values and physical constants. This option is chemically and mathematically self-consistent.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nThe only pair of values that correctly describes the chemical system is {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³}, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided solutions and an independent verification of the calculations, here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe core of this problem is to find a pair of values—acid volume and final pH—that are chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added must accomplish two distinct tasks:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction**: A certain amount of H⁺ is consumed to completely neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Equilibrium Maintenance**: An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to establish the given acidic pH.\n\nThis can be expressed with a simple mole balance equation:\n**(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess)**\n\nWe can solve this problem by first calculating the constant amount of H⁺ required for the reaction, and then testing each option to see which one satisfies the balance equation.\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for Reaction (`n_reacted`)**\n\nThis value is fixed and serves as the baseline for our check.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × [M(O) + M(H)] = 55.845 + 3 × [15.999 + 1.008] = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.00093575 mol**.\n*   **The Neutralization Reaction**:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Reacted**: The reaction stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point**: Any valid answer must provide at least 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n\n**2. Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\n\nNow we check which option satisfies the mole balance:\n`V_acid (L) × 0.1 M` ≈ `0.002807 mol` + `(10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L)`\n\n*   **A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   H⁺ Added: 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ Required: 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   Result: 0.003214 mol ≠ 0.002876 mol. Inconsistent.\n\n*   **B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   H⁺ Added: 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   Result: The acid added (0.002040 mol) is less than the amount required for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol). The solid would not fully dissolve. Impossible.\n\n*   **C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   H⁺ Added: 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   Result: This amount is slightly less than that required for the reaction (0.002807 mol), leaving no excess acid. It is impossible to achieve a pH of 2.04. Impossible.\n\n*   **D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   H⁺ Added (from volume): 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ Required (for reaction + final pH): 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   Result: The total acid added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total acid required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference of ~0.07% is due to rounding in the problem's values. This option is **chemically consistent**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that only the pair of values {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} satisfies the principles of stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. The volume of acid is sufficient to both completely dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the specified final pH. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem where the solution must be chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The best approach, as identified by nearly all candidate answers, is to check which of the provided options satisfies the chemical mole balance for the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. The Dual Role of the Acid**\n\nThe strong acid added (represented by H⁺) performs two essential tasks:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** It neutralizes the solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, consuming a specific amount of H⁺.\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance:** It provides an additional *excess* of H⁺ that remains in the final 100 cm³ solution. This excess determines the final pH and ensures the dissolved Fe³⁺ ions do not precipitate back out.\n\nThis leads to the core principle for verification:\n**Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles of H⁺ for Reaction + Moles of H⁺ in Excess**\n\n**2. Careful Point: Calculating the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nThis is a constant value for the problem and forms the basis of our check.\n*   **Reaction:** `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** Due to the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio, we need 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point:** Any valid option must supply *at least* 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n\n**3. Verifying Each Option**\n\nWe will now test each option to see if the \"Total Moles H⁺ Added\" from the given volume matches the \"Total Moles H⁺ Required\" by the system (reaction + final pH).\n\n*   `Moles Added = 0.1 M × Volume (L)`\n*   `Moles Required = 0.002807 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)` (The final volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L)\n\n**A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   **Moles Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Moles Required:** 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Moles Added and Moles Required are virtually identical (difference < 0.1%). **This option is chemically consistent.**\n\n**B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   **Moles Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The acid added (0.002805 mol) is slightly less than the amount required for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol). The solid would not fully dissolve. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   **Moles Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **Moles Required:** 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The amount of acid added does not match the amount required by the system. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   **Moles Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The acid added is far less than what is needed for the reaction. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nThe detailed analysis shows that only the pair of values {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} is self-consistent. The analysis of the candidate answers shows a broad consensus on these numerical values, although there was considerable confusion in matching them to the correct letter option. According to the original problem's lettering, these values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires finding the pair of values for acid volume and final pH that are chemically and mathematically consistent with the given conditions. A step-by-step analysis reveals the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Chemical Principle**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added must be sufficient to perform two tasks:\n1.  **Neutralization:** A specific amount of H⁺ is consumed by reacting completely with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃. This is a stoichiometric requirement.\n2.  **Equilibrium:** An additional amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to create the specified acidic pH. This excess acid prevents the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out of the solution.\n\nThis can be expressed as a mole balance equation:\n(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining in Excess)\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement (H⁺ Reacted)**\n\nThis value is constant for the problem and is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n*   **Chemical Reaction:** The neutralization reaction is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Reacted:** From the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio, the moles of H⁺ consumed are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\nThis is the absolute minimum amount of acid required. Any option providing less acid than this is automatically incorrect.\n\n**3. Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\n\nWe will now check which of the original options satisfies the mole balance equation.\n`Equation`: (Volume of Acid in L × 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)\n\n*   **A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.0204 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.0204 L × 0.1 M = 0.00204 mol.\n    *   This is less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction alone.\n    *   **Result**: Impossible.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **Left Hand Side (Acid Added)**: 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **Right Hand Side (Acid Required)**: `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   **Result**: The acid added (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match for the acid required (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding. This option is **consistent**.\n\n*   **C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **Left Hand Side (Acid Added)**: 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **Right Hand Side (Acid Required)**: `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   **Result**: The amount of acid added does not match the amount required. Inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n    *   This is slightly less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction, meaning the solid wouldn't even fully dissolve.\n    *   **Result**: Impossible.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Consistency is Key**: The correct approach, identified by all candidate answers, is not to solve for the values from scratch but to test the provided options for internal consistency.\n*   **Lettering Errors**: A majority of the candidate answers correctly identified that the values {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} were correct, but they incorrectly labeled the final answer. The confusion arose from re-ordering the options during analysis.\n*   **Definitive Answer**: The rigorous check confirms that only the pair of values in option B is chemically and mathematically self-consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem that requires a consistency check between stoichiometry and equilibrium principles. The correct answer will be the option where the volume of acid added is chemically consistent with the final pH of the solution after the acid has reacted with the Fe(OH)₃.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement: Acid for the Reaction**\n\nFirst, we determine the amount of H⁺ ions consumed in the neutralization reaction. This amount is constant for all options.\n\n*   **Balanced Chemical Reaction**: The dissolution of the basic solid Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (H⁺) is:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n    This shows a crucial 1-to-3 mole ratio between Fe(OH)₃ and H⁺.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3×M(O) + 3×M(H) = 55.845 + 3×(15.999) + 3×(1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    Using the 1:3 ratio, the moles of H⁺ consumed are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Formulate the Mole Balance Equation for Consistency Check**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must be enough for two purposes: the amount consumed in the reaction (`n_reacted`) and the amount left over in excess (`n_excess`) that establishes the final pH of the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n\nThe key relationship to check for is:\n**Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ in Excess**\n\nThis can be written as the equation:\n`C_acid × V_acid = n_reacted + ([H⁺]_final × V_final)`\n`0.1 M × V_acid (L) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L)`\n\n**3. Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nWe will now systematically test each option against the mole balance equation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Insufficient Acid.** Before doing a full calculation, we must ensure that the total acid added is at least enough for the reaction (`n_reacted` ≈ 0.002807 mol).\n    *   Option B: Acid Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol. This is less than 0.002807 mol. **Impossible.**\n    *   Option C: Acid Added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 0.002040 mol. This is much less than 0.002807 mol. **Impossible.**\n    *   Options B and C can be eliminated immediately because the volume of acid is not even sufficient to dissolve the solid completely.\n\n*   **Test Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   LHS (H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   RHS (H⁺ Required) = `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   LHS ≠ RHS. The amount of acid added is not consistent with the amount required to achieve the final state. **Inconsistent.**\n\n*   **Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   LHS (H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   RHS (H⁺ Required) = `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   LHS ≈ RHS. The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount required by the system to react and establish the final pH (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding. **Consistent.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that only the pair of values presented in option A, {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³}, is chemically and mathematically self-consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the methodologies from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Principle\nThe problem requires finding a self-consistent pair of values for the volume of acid added and the resulting pH. All provided analyses correctly identify the central principle: the total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added must serve two distinct purposes:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction**: A specific quantity of H⁺ is consumed to neutralize and dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ base.\n2.  **Equilibrium Maintenance**: An additional, excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to establish the specified acidic pH, which prevents the dissolved iron(III) ions from re-precipitating.\n\nThe correct answer must satisfy the mole balance equation:\n(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining for pH)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement\nThis is the fixed amount of acid needed to react with the solid. It's the baseline for our calculation.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H) = 55.845 + 3(15.999) + 3(1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Reaction and Mole Ratio**: The neutralization reaction is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. The mole ratio is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\nThis means that any valid option must supply *at least* 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n\n### Step 3: Test Each Option for Consistency\nNow, we will test each of the provided options to see which one satisfies the mole balance equation:\n`Volume (L) × 0.1 M` = `0.002807 mol` + `(10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L)`\n\n**A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added (from volume) = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   H⁺ Required (by system) = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   The amount added does not match the amount required. **Inconsistent.**\n\n**B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n*   This is less than the 0.002807 mol needed for the reaction alone. **Impossible.**\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   This is also less than the 0.002807 mol needed for the reaction alone (though very close, it still fails). **Impossible.**\n\n**D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added (from volume) = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   H⁺ Required (by system) = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the total amount required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values and constants. **This is the only consistent option.**\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   The methodology used across almost all candidate answers is correct and robust. The solution relies on a consistency check.\n*   The most common source of error in the candidate responses was not the calculation itself, but the incorrect labeling of the final option (e.g., calling the correct answer 'A', 'B', or 'C' when it is listed as 'D' in the prompt).\n*   The analysis definitively shows that the only chemically and mathematically sound pair of values is a pH of 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm³. According to the provided question, this corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem asks for a self-consistent set of values: the volume of acid added and the resulting pH of the solution. The most reliable method to solve this is to test each of the given options to see which one satisfies the principles of stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of strong acid (H⁺) that is consumed by reacting with the 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃. This amount is constant for all options.\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Using the atomic masses Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol, O ≈ 15.999 g/mol, and H ≈ 1.008 g/mol:\n    M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n\n3.  **Chemical Reaction**: The dissolution is a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ Consumed**: The reaction shows a 1-to-3 mole ratio. Therefore, the moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction (`n_reacted`) are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: Any correct option must provide at least 0.002807 moles of acid to dissolve the solid completely.\n\n**Step 2: Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\n\nNow we must check which option's pair of values (Volume, pH) satisfies the mole balance equation:\n(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining for pH)\n\nThe terms are calculated as:\n*   Total Moles H⁺ Added = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 M × V_acid (in L)\n*   Moles H⁺ Reacted = 0.002807 mol\n*   Moles H⁺ Remaining for pH = Final [H⁺] × Final Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L\n\nLet's check each option from the question.\n\n*   **A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   **Acid Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   **Consistency Check**: The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is slightly less than the amount needed for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol). The solid would not fully dissolve. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **Acid Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **Acid Required by System**: `n_reacted` + `n_for_pH`\n        = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L)\n        = 0.002807 mol + (0.002042 M × 0.1 L)\n        = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   **Consistency Check**: The total acid added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total acid required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding. **This option is self-consistent and correct**.\n\n*   **C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   **Acid Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   **Consistency Check**: The amount of acid added is far less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **Acid Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **Acid Required by System**: `n_reacted` + `n_for_pH`\n        = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻³.16 M × 0.1 L)\n        = 0.002807 mol + (0.000692 M × 0.1 L)\n        = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   **Consistency Check**: The acid added (0.003214 mol) does not match the acid required by the system (0.002876 mol). **Incorrect**.\n\n**Careful Point 2**: The candidate answers showed significant confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponded to which set of values. However, their underlying chemical analyses overwhelmingly and correctly identified the pair {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} as the only valid answer. By mapping this correct pair back to the original question's list, we confirm it is option B.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the pair of values in option B, pH 2.69 and 30.09 cm³, provides an amount of acid that is consistent with the chemical requirements to both fully dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the specified final pH.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a careful application of stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium principles. The correct answer will be the option where the given volume of acid and the final pH are chemically self-consistent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Governing Chemical Principle**\n\nThe total amount of the strong acid (H⁺) added must accomplish two things:\n1.  **React with the Solid:** A specific quantity of H⁺ is consumed in the neutralization reaction with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Establish the Final pH:** An additional, excess quantity of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep it acidic and prevent the dissolved Fe³⁺ from re-precipitating.\n\nThis can be expressed as a mole balance equation:\n`(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining for pH)`\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement (H⁺ for Reaction)**\n\nThis is the fixed amount of H⁺ needed to react with the solid.\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**: Using the atomic masses Fe (55.845), O (15.999), and H (1.008), the molar mass is:\n    55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**: Convert the given mass to moles:\n    Moles = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n3.  **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction**: The balanced chemical equation is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. Due to the 1:3 ratio, the moles of H⁺ consumed are:\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nNow, we check which of the provided options satisfies the mole balance equation. We will use `0.002807 mol` as the amount of H⁺ needed for the reaction. The total volume of the final solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = `0.002040 mol`.\n*   **Analysis**: The amount added is less than the `0.002807 mol` needed just for the reaction.

The tiny discrepancy (<0.1%) is due to rounding. This is a **consistent** option.\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = `0.002805 mol`.\n*   **Analysis**: The amount added is less than the `0.002807 mol` needed for the reaction, leaving no excess to create a pH of 2.04.

This is inconsistent.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of values that is chemically and mathematically self-consistent is {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³}, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to determine which pair of values (acid volume and resulting pH) is chemically and mathematically self-consistent for dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a total volume of 100 cm³.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental principle to solve this problem is to check which option satisfies the mole balance for the added acid. The total moles of strong acid (H⁺) added must be sufficient for two distinct purposes:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction**: An amount of H⁺ is consumed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ base.\n2.  **Equilibrium**: An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to establish the given acidic pH.\n\nThe relationship can be expressed as:\n**(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining for pH)**\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction**\nThis is a constant value based on the starting material.\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**: 55.845 g/mol (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.008 g/mol (H)) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**: Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Reaction**: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction**: Due to the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio, we need 3 times the moles of H⁺.\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\nNow we check which option satisfies the mole balance equation. We will use the formula:\n`(V_acid (L) × 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L)`\n\n*   **Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   This is less than the **0.002807 mol** required for the reaction alone. The Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. *This option is inconsistent.*\n\n*   **Option B: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ Required**: 0.002807 mol + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   The amount added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required (0.002876 mol). *This option is inconsistent.*\n\n*   **Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   This amount is significantly less than the 0.002807 mol needed for the reaction. *This option is inconsistent.*\n\n*   **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ Required**: 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) and the total amount required by the system (0.003011 mol) are nearly identical.

This provides very high confidence in the calculation. The discrepancies were in correctly mapping these values back to the letter in the original question prompt.\n*   **Stoichiometry vs. Equilibrium**: It's crucial to account for both the acid consumed by the reaction and the excess acid needed to maintain the final pH. Options A and C fail because they don't provide enough acid to even complete the reaction.\n*   **Units**: Always ensure consistent units (e.g., cm³ to L) throughout the calculations.\n\nBased on the consistent and verified analysis, the only valid answer is the one where the added acid matches the required acid. This is achieved with a pH of 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem asks for the correct combination of acid volume and final pH required to dissolve a specific amount of Fe(OH)₃. The most reliable method to solve this is to test which of the provided options is chemically and mathematically self-consistent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core principle is that the total amount of strong acid (H⁺ ions) added must serve two purposes:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction:** An amount of H⁺ is consumed to completely neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ base.\n2.  **Equilibrium/Excess:** An additional amount of H⁺ remains in the final solution, creating the specified pH and preventing the dissolved iron from re-precipitating.\n\nThis can be expressed as a mole balance equation:\n`(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining for pH)`\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction**\n\nThis is the fixed amount of H⁺ that will be consumed.\n*   **Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** M(Fe) + 3×(M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3×(15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (`n_reacted`)**: From the 1:3 reaction ratio, we need 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nWe will now check which option satisfies the mole balance equation:\n`(C_acid × V_acid) = n_reacted + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × V_total)`\nWhere `C_acid`= 0.1 M, `V_acid` is the volume in Liters from the option, `n_reacted`= 0.002807 mol, and `V_total`= 0.1 L.\n\n*   **A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ Required**: 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   The amount added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required (0.002876 mol). Inconsistent.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ Required**: 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   The amount added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount required (0.003011 mol). The <0.1% difference is due to rounding. **This option is consistent.**\n\n*   **C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   This is less than the `n_reacted` of 0.002807 mol. The solid would not dissolve. Impossible.\n\n*   **D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   This is slightly less than the amount needed for the reaction alone (`n_reacted` ≈ 0.002807 mol). It is impossible to achieve a pH of 2.04 with virtually no excess acid. Impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of values that creates a chemically and mathematically self-consistent system is option B. The volume of 30.09 cm³ provides the correct amount of acid to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of chemical stoichiometry and equilibrium. The correct answer will be the pair of values (acid volume and final pH) that is chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The most reliable method, as identified by nearly all candidate answers, is to check which option satisfies the mole balance for the hydrogen ions (H⁺).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nWhen the strong acid is added, its hydrogen ions (H⁺) perform two tasks:\n*   **Reaction:** A specific amount of H⁺ is completely consumed by neutralizing the solid base, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Equilibrium:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep it acidic and prevent the dissolved iron from re-precipitating.\n\nThis can be summarized by the mole balance equation:\n**(Total moles of H⁺ added) = (Moles of H⁺ consumed by reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining in excess)**\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nThis is a constant value representing the moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction.\n\n*   **Chemical Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    *   This shows a crucial 1-to-3 mole ratio.\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    *   M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g**:\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    *   From the 1:3 ratio, `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: Any valid option must provide a volume of acid that contains *at least* 0.002807 moles of H⁺. Options B and C can be eliminated immediately on this basis:\n*   Option B (28.05 cm³): Adds 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol of H⁺. (Insufficient)\n*   Option C (20.40 cm³): Adds 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol of H⁺. (Insufficient)\n\nThis leaves us with options A and D.\n\n**3. Test the Remaining Options for Consistency**\n\nWe will now check if option A or D satisfies the mole balance equation:\n`Total H⁺ Added` = `n_reacted` + `H⁺ remaining`\n`(Volume in L × 0.1 M)` = `0.002807 mol` + `(10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)`\n\n**Testing Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Left Side (H⁺ Added)**: 0.03009 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Right Side (H⁺ Required)**:\n    *   `H⁺ remaining` = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n    *   Total required = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the H⁺ required by the system (0.003011 mol). The <0.1% difference is due to rounding. **This option is self-consistent.**\n\n**Testing Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   **Left Side (H⁺ Added)**: 0.03214 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **Right Side (H⁺ Required)**:\n    *   `H⁺ remaining` = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol.\n    *   Total required = 0.002807 mol + 0.0000692 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The H⁺ added (0.003214 mol) does not match the H⁺ required by the system (0.002876 mol). This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis confirms that only the pair of values {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} is chemically and mathematically sound. This corresponds to option A in the question prompt.\n\n**Careful Point 2 (Regarding Candidate Answers)**: While the provided candidate answers showed confusion over the option letters (A, B, C, or D), there was a universal agreement among them that the correct *numerical values* are **pH 2.69** and **30.09 cm³**. This reinforces the calculation's conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem that can be solved by checking which of the provided options is chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two separate purposes: neutralizing the solid Fe(OH)₃ and then establishing the final acidic pH in the solution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n**1. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the moles of H⁺ ions from the strong acid that are consumed in the neutralization reaction. This amount is fixed.\n\n*   **Balanced Chemical Reaction**: The reaction for the dissolution is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ to react.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed in Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    Using the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio, the moles of H⁺ that are consumed are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n    This is the minimum amount of H⁺ required just to make the solid disappear.\n\n**2. Establish the Mole Balance Equation for a Consistency Check**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid solution must equal the sum of the H⁺ consumed in the reaction and the H⁺ left over in excess to create the final pH.\n\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted (`n_reacted`) + Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess (`n_excess`)\n\nThis can be written as the equation we will use for testing:\n`C_acid × V_acid` = `0.002807` + `(10⁻ᵖᴴ × V_final)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `C_acid` = 0.1 mol/L\n*   `V_acid` is the volume in Liters from the option being tested.\n*   `pH` is the pH from the option being tested.\n*   `V_final` = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n\n**3. Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nWe will now substitute the values from each option into the mole balance equation.\n\n*   **A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   LHS (H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × (30.09 / 1000) L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   RHS (H⁺ Required) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   **Result:** The H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match to the H⁺ required (0.003011 mol). The tiny <0.1% difference is due to rounding. **This option is self-consistent.**\n\n*   **B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   **Result:** The acid added (0.002040 mol) is less than the amount required for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol). The solid would not dissolve. **This option is impossible.**\n\n*   **C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   LHS (H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   RHS (H⁺ Required) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   **Result:** The amount of acid added and the amount required are not close. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n*   **D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   **Result:** The acid added is less than that needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol), so it cannot dissolve the solid, let alone establish a pH of 2.04. **This option is impossible.**\n\nThe only option that represents a chemically and mathematically valid state is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires finding the pair of values (acid volume and final pH) that is chemically consistent with dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a final volume of 100 cm³. The most robust method, as demonstrated by the candidate answers, is to check which of the given options satisfies the mole balance for the acid (H⁺).\n\n### Principle of Analysis: Mole Balance\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid must be sufficient for two distinct purposes:\n1.  **Reaction:** An amount of H⁺ is consumed in the neutralization reaction with the solid Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Equilibrium:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the solution to maintain the final acidic pH, which prevents the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out.\n\nThe governing equation for a consistent answer is:\n**(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining in Excess)**\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the H⁺ Consumed by Reaction\n\nThis is the stoichiometric part of the problem and is a fixed quantity.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.00093575 mol**.\n*   **Chemical Reaction**: The reaction is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. The key is the 1:3 mole ratio.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.0028073 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Test Each Option for Self-Consistency\n\nNow, we check which option satisfies the mole balance equation.\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The acid added (0.002040 mol) is less than the amount required just to react with the solid (0.0028073 mol). Therefore, the solid would not dissolve.\n*   **Verdict**: Inconsistent.\n\n**B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **H⁺ Remaining in Excess**: This is determined by the final pH in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume.\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   `n_excess` = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L ≈ **0.0002042 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required** = `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.0028073 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030115 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point**: Compare the H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) with the H⁺ required (0.0030115 mol). These values are nearly identical (a difference of ~0.08%, due to rounding in the problem's values).\n*   **Verdict**: Consistent.\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The acid added (0.002805 mol) is insufficient to even complete the reaction (0.0028073 mol needed). Even a tiny excess would be needed to lower the pH, let alone to pH 2.04 which requires a significant excess.\n*   **Verdict**: Inconsistent.\n\n**D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **H⁺ Remaining in Excess**: [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 0.000692 M. `n_excess` = 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = **0.0000692 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required** = `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.0028073 mol + 0.0000692 mol = **0.0028765 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The acid added (0.003214 mol) is not equal to the acid required (0.0028765 mol). The volume is too large for the resulting pH.\n*   **Verdict**: Inconsistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe systematic analysis confirms that only one option presents a chemically and mathematically self-consistent scenario. The volume of 30.09 cm³ provides almost exactly the required amount of acid to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to establish a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The core of the problem is to find a self-consistent pair of values for the volume of acid and the final pH of a solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Process**\n\nTo dissolve the solid base Fe(OH)₃, a strong acid (H⁺) is added. The total amount of H⁺ added performs two distinct tasks:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction**: A certain amount of H⁺ is consumed in a neutralization reaction to dissolve the solid.\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance**: An additional, excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final solution to keep the pH acidic enough to prevent the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out.\n\nThe correct answer must be the option where the values for volume and pH satisfy this chemical reality. This can be checked using a mole balance equation, a method correctly identified by all the sound candidate answers.\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Acid Requirement**\n\nThis value is constant and is the foundation of the calculation.\n*   **Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** Using standard atomic weights (Fe=55.845, O=15.999, H=1.008), the molar mass is 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction:** Based on the 1:3 ratio in the chemical equation, the moles of H⁺ consumed (`n_reacted`) are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Set Up the Consistency Check (Mole Balance Equation)**\n\nFor any option to be correct, the following relationship must hold true:\n(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess)\n\nMathematically, this is:\n`(V_acid [in L] × 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)`\n\n**4. Systematically Test Each Option**\n\nWe will now test each option from the original question against this equation.\n\n*   **A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.0204 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.0204 L × 0.1 M = **0.00204 mol**.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is less than the `n_reacted` of 0.002807 mol. Not enough acid is added to even dissolve the solid completely.\n    *   **Result**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   **Analysis**: This amount is also slightly less than that required for the reaction (`n_reacted` ≈ 0.002807 mol). It is therefore impossible for this volume of acid to both dissolve the solid and create a strongly acidic pH of 2.04.\n    *   **Result**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **Total H⁺ Required by the System**:\n        *   `n_reacted` = 0.002807 mol\n        *   `n_excess` for pH = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol\n        *   Total Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   **Analysis**: The amount of H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match for the total amount required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor discrepancy (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values.\n    *   **Result**: **Correct and self-consistent.**\n\n*   **D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **Total H⁺ Required by the System**:\n        *   `n_reacted` = 0.002807 mol\n        *   `n_excess` for pH = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol\n        *   Total Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   **Analysis**: The amount of acid added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required by the system (0.002876 mol).\n    *   **Result**: Incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n1.  **Consensus on Method**: The vast majority of candidate answers correctly identify the two-part nature of the problem (stoichiometry + equilibrium) and use a mole balance check for verification.\n2.  **Consensus on Calculation**: The numerical calculations for `n_reacted` (~0.002807 mol) and the subsequent consistency check are overwhelmingly in agreement across all candidates. They all find that the pair {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} is the only one that works.\n3.  **Lettering Confusion**: The primary reason for different final letter choices among the candidates (e.g., A, B, C, or D) is inconsistent re-labeling of the options. However, the underlying analysis correctly identifies the same numerical answer in every case.\n4.  **Final Decision**: Based on a rigorous and consistent application of chemical principles, the only valid answer is the one where the amount of acid added matches the amount required for both reaction and the final pH. This is unequivocally the pair **pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**, which corresponds to option **C** in the provided question list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and verifying the logic from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Task and Method\n\nThe problem asks for a pair of values—acid volume and resulting pH—that are chemically self-consistent for dissolving a specific amount of Fe(OH)₃. As demonstrated by all the provided candidate answers, the most robust method to solve this is not to derive the values from scratch, but to test which of the given options satisfies the principles of stoichiometry and equilibrium.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the mole balance of the acid (H⁺ ions):\n`Total moles of H⁺ added` = `Moles of H⁺ consumed in reaction` + `Moles of H⁺ remaining in excess (to create the final pH)`\n\n### 2. Stoichiometric Calculation: Moles of H⁺ Consumed\n\nThis is a fixed quantity that all valid analyses must calculate correctly.\n\n*   **Chemical Reaction:** The neutralization of the base is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. This shows a 1:3 mole ratio between Fe(OH)₃ and the strong acid (H⁺).\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** M(Fe) + 3×M(O) + 3×M(H) ≈ 55.845 + 3(15.999) + 3(1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Given 0.1 g, the moles are: 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed (`n_reacted`):** Based on the 1:3 ratio, the moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction are 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\nAny valid answer must use a volume of acid that provides *at least* this many moles of H⁺.\n\n### 3. Consistency Check of Each Option\n\nNow, we must test each option from the original question against the mole balance equation. We will refer to the original lettering of the options.\n\n*   **Total H⁺ Added** = `0.1 M × Volume (L)`\n*   **H⁺ Remaining (Excess)** = `10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L`\n*   **Total H⁺ Required** = `0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1)`\n\n**A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required:** 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   **Analysis:** The moles added (0.003009) and the moles required (0.003011) are nearly identical (a difference of <0.1%, likely due to rounding). **This option is chemically self-consistent.**\n\n**B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Analysis:** This amount is slightly *less* than the 0.002807 mol required just to react with the solid. The Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. **This option is impossible.**\n\n**C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required:** 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + (0.000069 M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000007 = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   **Analysis:** The moles added (0.003214) do not match the moles required (0.002876). **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n*   **Analysis:** This amount is far less than the 0.002807 mol needed for the reaction. **This option is impossible.**\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe chemical and mathematical analysis overwhelmingly demonstrates that the only self-consistent pair of values is {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³}. These values correspond to option A in the original question's list.\n\nWhile the candidate answers showed considerable confusion in mapping the correct numerical answer to the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D), their underlying calculations correctly identified the same consistent pair of values.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points and correct methodology identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**1. Define the Chemical Process and the Core Principle**\nThe problem involves dissolving a solid base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), in a strong acid. The total amount of acid added must perform two distinct tasks:\n*   **Reaction:** An amount of H⁺ is stoichiometrically consumed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Equilibrium:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep the pH low, which prevents the dissolved iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) from re-precipitating as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe central principle to solve this problem is a mole balance. The correct answer choice must be self-consistent, meaning the total moles of H⁺ added must equal the moles of H⁺ consumed in the reaction plus the moles of H⁺ remaining in excess.\n\n**Equation**: Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ in Excess\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Reacted (Stoichiometric Requirement)**\nThis is a fixed quantity that forms the baseline for our analysis.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Balanced Chemical Reaction**:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Reacted**: The reaction stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Part B: Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\nNow we check which option's (Volume, pH) pair satisfies the mole balance equation. We can quickly eliminate options where the acid added is insufficient even for the reaction.\n\n*   **Acid needed for reaction**: 0.002807 mol.\n*   Volume needed for reaction = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L or **28.07 cm³**.\n*   Any option with a volume less than 28.07 cm³ is impossible.\n\n    *   **Option C (20.40 cm³)** and **Option D (28.05 cm³)** are therefore impossible, as they do not provide enough acid to even dissolve the solid. This allows us to confidently eliminate them.\n\nNow we only need to test options A and B.\n\n**Test Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required by the system**:\n    *   H⁺ for reaction = **0.002807 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ in excess for pH = [H⁺] × V_total = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ **0.000069 mol**.\n    *   Total Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   The amount added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required (0.002876 mol). This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added** (from the given volume):\n    0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required** (for reaction + final pH):\n    *   H⁺ for reaction = **0.002807 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ in excess for pH = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.000204 mol**.\n    *   Total Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   The amount of H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values and physical constants. This option is chemically and mathematically self-consistent.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nThe only pair of values that correctly describes the chemical system is {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³}, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided solutions and an independent verification of the calculations, here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe core of this problem is to find a pair of values—acid volume and final pH—that are chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added must accomplish two distinct tasks:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction**: A certain amount of H⁺ is consumed to completely neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Equilibrium Maintenance**: An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to establish the given acidic pH.\n\nThis can be expressed with a simple mole balance equation:\n**(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess)**\n\nWe can solve this problem by first calculating the constant amount of H⁺ required for the reaction, and then testing each option to see which one satisfies the balance equation.\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for Reaction (`n_reacted`)**\n\nThis value is fixed and serves as the baseline for our check.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × [M(O) + M(H)] = 55.845 + 3 × [15.999 + 1.008] = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.00093575 mol**.\n*   **The Neutralization Reaction**:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Reacted**: The reaction stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point**: Any valid answer must provide at least 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n\n**2. Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\n\nNow we check which option satisfies the mole balance:\n`V_acid (L) × 0.1 M` ≈ `0.002807 mol` + `(10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L)`\n\n*   **A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   H⁺ Added: 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ Required: 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   Result: 0.003214 mol ≠ 0.002876 mol. Inconsistent.\n\n*   **B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   H⁺ Added: 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   Result: The acid added (0.002040 mol) is less than the amount required for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol). The solid would not fully dissolve. Impossible.\n\n*   **C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   H⁺ Added: 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   Result: This amount is slightly less than that required for the reaction (0.002807 mol), leaving no excess acid. It is impossible to achieve a pH of 2.04. Impossible.\n\n*   **D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   H⁺ Added (from volume): 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   H⁺ Required (for reaction + final pH): 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   Result: The total acid added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total acid required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference of ~0.07% is due to rounding in the problem's values. This option is **chemically consistent**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that only the pair of values {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} satisfies the principles of stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. The volume of acid is sufficient to both completely dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the specified final pH. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem where the solution must be chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The best approach, as identified by nearly all candidate answers, is to check which of the provided options satisfies the chemical mole balance for the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. The Dual Role of the Acid**\n\nThe strong acid added (represented by H⁺) performs two essential tasks:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** It neutralizes the solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, consuming a specific amount of H⁺.\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance:** It provides an additional *excess* of H⁺ that remains in the final 100 cm³ solution. This excess determines the final pH and ensures the dissolved Fe³⁺ ions do not precipitate back out.\n\nThis leads to the core principle for verification:\n**Total Moles of H⁺ Added = Moles of H⁺ for Reaction + Moles of H⁺ in Excess**\n\n**2. Careful Point: Calculating the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nThis is a constant value for the problem and forms the basis of our check.\n*   **Reaction:** `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** Due to the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio, we need 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point:** Any valid option must supply *at least* 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n\n**3. Verifying Each Option**\n\nWe will now test each option to see if the \"Total Moles H⁺ Added\" from the given volume matches the \"Total Moles H⁺ Required\" by the system (reaction + final pH).\n\n*   `Moles Added = 0.1 M × Volume (L)`\n*   `Moles Required = 0.002807 + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)` (The final volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L)\n\n**A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   **Moles Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Moles Required:** 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Moles Added and Moles Required are virtually identical (difference < 0.1%). **This option is chemically consistent.**\n\n**B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   **Moles Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The acid added (0.002805 mol) is slightly less than the amount required for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol). The solid would not fully dissolve. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   **Moles Added:** 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **Moles Required:** 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The amount of acid added does not match the amount required by the system. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   **Moles Added:** 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The acid added is far less than what is needed for the reaction. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nThe detailed analysis shows that only the pair of values {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} is self-consistent. The analysis of the candidate answers shows a broad consensus on these numerical values, although there was considerable confusion in matching them to the correct letter option. According to the original problem's lettering, these values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires finding the pair of values for acid volume and final pH that are chemically and mathematically consistent with the given conditions. A step-by-step analysis reveals the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Chemical Principle**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added must be sufficient to perform two tasks:\n1.  **Neutralization:** A specific amount of H⁺ is consumed by reacting completely with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃. This is a stoichiometric requirement.\n2.  **Equilibrium:** An additional amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to create the specified acidic pH. This excess acid prevents the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out of the solution.\n\nThis can be expressed as a mole balance equation:\n(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining in Excess)\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement (H⁺ Reacted)**\n\nThis value is constant for the problem and is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n*   **Chemical Reaction:** The neutralization reaction is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Reacted:** From the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio, the moles of H⁺ consumed are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\nThis is the absolute minimum amount of acid required. Any option providing less acid than this is automatically incorrect.\n\n**3. Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\n\nWe will now check which of the original options satisfies the mole balance equation.\n`Equation`: (Volume of Acid in L × 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)\n\n*   **A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.0204 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.0204 L × 0.1 M = 0.00204 mol.\n    *   This is less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction alone.\n    *   **Result**: Impossible.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **Left Hand Side (Acid Added)**: 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **Right Hand Side (Acid Required)**: `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   **Result**: The acid added (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match for the acid required (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding. This option is **consistent**.\n\n*   **C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **Left Hand Side (Acid Added)**: 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **Right Hand Side (Acid Required)**: `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   **Result**: The amount of acid added does not match the amount required. Inconsistent.\n\n*   **D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n    *   This is slightly less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction, meaning the solid wouldn't even fully dissolve.\n    *   **Result**: Impossible.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Consistency is Key**: The correct approach, identified by all candidate answers, is not to solve for the values from scratch but to test the provided options for internal consistency.\n*   **Lettering Errors**: A majority of the candidate answers correctly identified that the values {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} were correct, but they incorrectly labeled the final answer. The confusion arose from re-ordering the options during analysis.\n*   **Definitive Answer**: The rigorous check confirms that only the pair of values in option B is chemically and mathematically self-consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem that requires a consistency check between stoichiometry and equilibrium principles. The correct answer will be the option where the volume of acid added is chemically consistent with the final pH of the solution after the acid has reacted with the Fe(OH)₃.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement: Acid for the Reaction**\n\nFirst, we determine the amount of H⁺ ions consumed in the neutralization reaction. This amount is constant for all options.\n\n*   **Balanced Chemical Reaction**: The dissolution of the basic solid Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (H⁺) is:\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n    This shows a crucial 1-to-3 mole ratio between Fe(OH)₃ and H⁺.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3×M(O) + 3×M(H) = 55.845 + 3×(15.999) + 3×(1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    Using the 1:3 ratio, the moles of H⁺ consumed are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Formulate the Mole Balance Equation for Consistency Check**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid must be enough for two purposes: the amount consumed in the reaction (`n_reacted`) and the amount left over in excess (`n_excess`) that establishes the final pH of the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution.\n\nThe key relationship to check for is:\n**Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ in Excess**\n\nThis can be written as the equation:\n`C_acid × V_acid = n_reacted + ([H⁺]_final × V_final)`\n`0.1 M × V_acid (L) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L)`\n\n**3. Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nWe will now systematically test each option against the mole balance equation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Insufficient Acid.** Before doing a full calculation, we must ensure that the total acid added is at least enough for the reaction (`n_reacted` ≈ 0.002807 mol).\n    *   Option B: Acid Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol. This is less than 0.002807 mol. **Impossible.**\n    *   Option C: Acid Added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 0.002040 mol. This is much less than 0.002807 mol. **Impossible.**\n    *   Options B and C can be eliminated immediately because the volume of acid is not even sufficient to dissolve the solid completely.\n\n*   **Test Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   LHS (H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   RHS (H⁺ Required) = `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   LHS ≠ RHS. The amount of acid added is not consistent with the amount required to achieve the final state. **Inconsistent.**\n\n*   **Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   LHS (H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   RHS (H⁺ Required) = `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   LHS ≈ RHS. The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount required by the system to react and establish the final pH (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding. **Consistent.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that only the pair of values presented in option A, {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³}, is chemically and mathematically self-consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the methodologies from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Principle\nThe problem requires finding a self-consistent pair of values for the volume of acid added and the resulting pH. All provided analyses correctly identify the central principle: the total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added must serve two distinct purposes:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction**: A specific quantity of H⁺ is consumed to neutralize and dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ base.\n2.  **Equilibrium Maintenance**: An additional, excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to establish the specified acidic pH, which prevents the dissolved iron(III) ions from re-precipitating.\n\nThe correct answer must satisfy the mole balance equation:\n(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining for pH)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement\nThis is the fixed amount of acid needed to react with the solid. It's the baseline for our calculation.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × M(O) + 3 × M(H) = 55.845 + 3(15.999) + 3(1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Reaction and Mole Ratio**: The neutralization reaction is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. The mole ratio is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\nThis means that any valid option must supply *at least* 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n\n### Step 3: Test Each Option for Consistency\nNow, we will test each of the provided options to see which one satisfies the mole balance equation:\n`Volume (L) × 0.1 M` = `0.002807 mol` + `(10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L)`\n\n**A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added (from volume) = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   H⁺ Required (by system) = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   The amount added does not match the amount required. **Inconsistent.**\n\n**B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n*   This is less than the 0.002807 mol needed for the reaction alone. **Impossible.**\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   This is also less than the 0.002807 mol needed for the reaction alone (though very close, it still fails). **Impossible.**\n\n**D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   H⁺ Added (from volume) = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   H⁺ Required (by system) = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the total amount required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values and constants. **This is the only consistent option.**\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   The methodology used across almost all candidate answers is correct and robust. The solution relies on a consistency check.\n*   The most common source of error in the candidate responses was not the calculation itself, but the incorrect labeling of the final option (e.g., calling the correct answer 'A', 'B', or 'C' when it is listed as 'D' in the prompt).\n*   The analysis definitively shows that the only chemically and mathematically sound pair of values is a pH of 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm³. According to the provided question, this corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem asks for a self-consistent set of values: the volume of acid added and the resulting pH of the solution. The most reliable method to solve this is to test each of the given options to see which one satisfies the principles of stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of strong acid (H⁺) that is consumed by reacting with the 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃. This amount is constant for all options.\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Using the atomic masses Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol, O ≈ 15.999 g/mol, and H ≈ 1.008 g/mol:\n    M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n\n3.  **Chemical Reaction**: The dissolution is a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ Consumed**: The reaction shows a 1-to-3 mole ratio. Therefore, the moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction (`n_reacted`) are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: Any correct option must provide at least 0.002807 moles of acid to dissolve the solid completely.\n\n**Step 2: Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\n\nNow we must check which option's pair of values (Volume, pH) satisfies the mole balance equation:\n(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining for pH)\n\nThe terms are calculated as:\n*   Total Moles H⁺ Added = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 M × V_acid (in L)\n*   Moles H⁺ Reacted = 0.002807 mol\n*   Moles H⁺ Remaining for pH = Final [H⁺] × Final Volume = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L\n\nLet's check each option from the question.\n\n*   **A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   **Acid Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   **Consistency Check**: The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is slightly less than the amount needed for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol). The solid would not fully dissolve. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **Acid Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **Acid Required by System**: `n_reacted` + `n_for_pH`\n        = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L)\n        = 0.002807 mol + (0.002042 M × 0.1 L)\n        = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   **Consistency Check**: The total acid added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total acid required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding. **This option is self-consistent and correct**.\n\n*   **C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   **Acid Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   **Consistency Check**: The amount of acid added is far less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **Acid Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **Acid Required by System**: `n_reacted` + `n_for_pH`\n        = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻³.16 M × 0.1 L)\n        = 0.002807 mol + (0.000692 M × 0.1 L)\n        = 0.002807 mol + 0.000069 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   **Consistency Check**: The acid added (0.003214 mol) does not match the acid required by the system (0.002876 mol). **Incorrect**.\n\n**Careful Point 2**: The candidate answers showed significant confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponded to which set of values. However, their underlying chemical analyses overwhelmingly and correctly identified the pair {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} as the only valid answer. By mapping this correct pair back to the original question's list, we confirm it is option B.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the pair of values in option B, pH 2.69 and 30.09 cm³, provides an amount of acid that is consistent with the chemical requirements to both fully dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the specified final pH.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a careful application of stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium principles. The correct answer will be the option where the given volume of acid and the final pH are chemically self-consistent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Governing Chemical Principle**\n\nThe total amount of the strong acid (H⁺) added must accomplish two things:\n1.  **React with the Solid:** A specific quantity of H⁺ is consumed in the neutralization reaction with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Establish the Final pH:** An additional, excess quantity of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep it acidic and prevent the dissolved Fe³⁺ from re-precipitating.\n\nThis can be expressed as a mole balance equation:\n`(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining for pH)`\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement (H⁺ for Reaction)**\n\nThis is the fixed amount of H⁺ needed to react with the solid.\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**: Using the atomic masses Fe (55.845), O (15.999), and H (1.008), the molar mass is:\n    55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**: Convert the given mass to moles:\n    Moles = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n3.  **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction**: The balanced chemical equation is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. Due to the 1:3 ratio, the moles of H⁺ consumed are:\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nNow, we check which of the provided options satisfies the mole balance equation. We will use `0.002807 mol` as the amount of H⁺ needed for the reaction. The total volume of the final solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = `0.002040 mol`.\n*   **Analysis**: The amount added is less than the `0.002807 mol` needed just for the reaction.

The tiny discrepancy (<0.1%) is due to rounding. This is a **consistent** option.\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = `0.002805 mol`.\n*   **Analysis**: The amount added is less than the `0.002807 mol` needed for the reaction, leaving no excess to create a pH of 2.04.

This is inconsistent.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of values that is chemically and mathematically self-consistent is {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³}, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to determine which pair of values (acid volume and resulting pH) is chemically and mathematically self-consistent for dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a total volume of 100 cm³.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental principle to solve this problem is to check which option satisfies the mole balance for the added acid. The total moles of strong acid (H⁺) added must be sufficient for two distinct purposes:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction**: An amount of H⁺ is consumed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ base.\n2.  **Equilibrium**: An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to establish the given acidic pH.\n\nThe relationship can be expressed as:\n**(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining for pH)**\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction**\nThis is a constant value based on the starting material.\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**: 55.845 g/mol (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 g/mol (O) + 1.008 g/mol (H)) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**: Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Reaction**: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction**: Due to the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio, we need 3 times the moles of H⁺.\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\nNow we check which option satisfies the mole balance equation. We will use the formula:\n`(V_acid (L) × 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻ᵖᴴ M × 0.1 L)`\n\n*   **Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   This is less than the **0.002807 mol** required for the reaction alone. The Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. *This option is inconsistent.*\n\n*   **Option B: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ Required**: 0.002807 mol + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   The amount added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required (0.002876 mol). *This option is inconsistent.*\n\n*   **Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   This amount is significantly less than the 0.002807 mol needed for the reaction. *This option is inconsistent.*\n\n*   **Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ Required**: 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) and the total amount required by the system (0.003011 mol) are nearly identical. The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's given values. *This option is consistent.*\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Methodology**: For multiple-choice questions like this, checking the consistency of the given options is far more efficient than attempting to solve the problem from scratch.\n*   **Consensus of Agents**: All 15 candidate answers, despite labeling their final choices with different letters, converged on the same numerical result: a pH of **2.69** and a volume of **30.09 cm³**. This provides very high confidence in the calculation. The discrepancies were in correctly mapping these values back to the letter in the original question prompt.\n*   **Stoichiometry vs. Equilibrium**: It's crucial to account for both the acid consumed by the reaction and the excess acid needed to maintain the final pH. Options A and C fail because they don't provide enough acid to even complete the reaction.\n*   **Units**: Always ensure consistent units (e.g., cm³ to L) throughout the calculations.\n\nBased on the consistent and verified analysis, the only valid answer is the one where the added acid matches the required acid. This is achieved with a pH of 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm³.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem asks for the correct combination of acid volume and final pH required to dissolve a specific amount of Fe(OH)₃. The most reliable method to solve this is to test which of the provided options is chemically and mathematically self-consistent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core principle is that the total amount of strong acid (H⁺ ions) added must serve two purposes:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Reaction:** An amount of H⁺ is consumed to completely neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ base.\n2.  **Equilibrium/Excess:** An additional amount of H⁺ remains in the final solution, creating the specified pH and preventing the dissolved iron from re-precipitating.\n\nThis can be expressed as a mole balance equation:\n`(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining for pH)`\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction**\n\nThis is the fixed amount of H⁺ that will be consumed.\n*   **Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** M(Fe) + 3×(M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3×(15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (`n_reacted`)**: From the 1:3 reaction ratio, we need 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nWe will now check which option satisfies the mole balance equation:\n`(C_acid × V_acid) = n_reacted + (10⁻ᵖᴴ × V_total)`\nWhere `C_acid`= 0.1 M, `V_acid` is the volume in Liters from the option, `n_reacted`= 0.002807 mol, and `V_total`= 0.1 L.\n\n*   **A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ Required**: 0.002807 + (10⁻³.¹⁶ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   The amount added (0.003214 mol) does not match the amount required (0.002876 mol). Inconsistent.\n\n*   **B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   **H⁺ Required**: 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   The amount added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the amount required (0.003011 mol). The <0.1% difference is due to rounding. **This option is consistent.**\n\n*   **C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   This is less than the `n_reacted` of 0.002807 mol. The solid would not dissolve. Impossible.\n\n*   **D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n    *   **H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   This is slightly less than the amount needed for the reaction alone (`n_reacted` ≈ 0.002807 mol). It is impossible to achieve a pH of 2.04 with virtually no excess acid. Impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of values that creates a chemically and mathematically self-consistent system is option B. The volume of 30.09 cm³ provides the correct amount of acid to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of chemical stoichiometry and equilibrium. The correct answer will be the pair of values (acid volume and final pH) that is chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The most reliable method, as identified by nearly all candidate answers, is to check which option satisfies the mole balance for the hydrogen ions (H⁺).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nWhen the strong acid is added, its hydrogen ions (H⁺) perform two tasks:\n*   **Reaction:** A specific amount of H⁺ is completely consumed by neutralizing the solid base, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Equilibrium:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep it acidic and prevent the dissolved iron from re-precipitating.\n\nThis can be summarized by the mole balance equation:\n**(Total moles of H⁺ added) = (Moles of H⁺ consumed by reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining in excess)**\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nThis is a constant value representing the moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction.\n\n*   **Chemical Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    *   This shows a crucial 1-to-3 mole ratio.\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    *   M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g**:\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    *   From the 1:3 ratio, `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: Any valid option must provide a volume of acid that contains *at least* 0.002807 moles of H⁺. Options B and C can be eliminated immediately on this basis:\n*   Option B (28.05 cm³): Adds 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol of H⁺. (Insufficient)\n*   Option C (20.40 cm³): Adds 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol of H⁺. (Insufficient)\n\nThis leaves us with options A and D.\n\n**3. Test the Remaining Options for Consistency**\n\nWe will now check if option A or D satisfies the mole balance equation:\n`Total H⁺ Added` = `n_reacted` + `H⁺ remaining`\n`(Volume in L × 0.1 M)` = `0.002807 mol` + `(10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L)`\n\n**Testing Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Left Side (H⁺ Added)**: 0.03009 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Right Side (H⁺ Required)**:\n    *   `H⁺ remaining` = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol.\n    *   Total required = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the H⁺ required by the system (0.003011 mol). The <0.1% difference is due to rounding. **This option is self-consistent.**\n\n**Testing Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   **Left Side (H⁺ Added)**: 0.03214 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **Right Side (H⁺ Required)**:\n    *   `H⁺ remaining` = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol.\n    *   Total required = 0.002807 mol + 0.0000692 mol = **0.002876 mol**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The H⁺ added (0.003214 mol) does not match the H⁺ required by the system (0.002876 mol). This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis confirms that only the pair of values {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} is chemically and mathematically sound. This corresponds to option A in the question prompt.\n\n**Careful Point 2 (Regarding Candidate Answers)**: While the provided candidate answers showed confusion over the option letters (A, B, C, or D), there was a universal agreement among them that the correct *numerical values* are **pH 2.69** and **30.09 cm³**. This reinforces the calculation's conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem that can be solved by checking which of the provided options is chemically and mathematically self-consistent. The total amount of acid added must be sufficient for two separate purposes: neutralizing the solid Fe(OH)₃ and then establishing the final acidic pH in the solution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n**1. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the moles of H⁺ ions from the strong acid that are consumed in the neutralization reaction. This amount is fixed.\n\n*   **Balanced Chemical Reaction**: The reaction for the dissolution is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ to react.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed in Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    Using the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio, the moles of H⁺ that are consumed are:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n    This is the minimum amount of H⁺ required just to make the solid disappear.\n\n**2. Establish the Mole Balance Equation for a Consistency Check**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid solution must equal the sum of the H⁺ consumed in the reaction and the H⁺ left over in excess to create the final pH.\n\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted (`n_reacted`) + Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess (`n_excess`)\n\nThis can be written as the equation we will use for testing:\n`C_acid × V_acid` = `0.002807` + `(10⁻ᵖᴴ × V_final)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `C_acid` = 0.1 mol/L\n*   `V_acid` is the volume in Liters from the option being tested.\n*   `pH` is the pH from the option being tested.\n*   `V_final` = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n\n**3. Test Each Option for Consistency**\n\nWe will now substitute the values from each option into the mole balance equation.\n\n*   **A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   LHS (H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × (30.09 / 1000) L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   RHS (H⁺ Required) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n    *   **Result:** The H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match to the H⁺ required (0.003011 mol). The tiny <0.1% difference is due to rounding. **This option is self-consistent.**\n\n*   **B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n    *   **Result:** The acid added (0.002040 mol) is less than the amount required for the reaction alone (0.002807 mol). The solid would not dissolve. **This option is impossible.**\n\n*   **C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   LHS (H⁺ Added) = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n    *   RHS (H⁺ Required) = 0.002807 mol + (10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**.\n    *   **Result:** The amount of acid added and the amount required are not close. **This option is inconsistent.**\n\n*   **D) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n    *   **Result:** The acid added is less than that needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol), so it cannot dissolve the solid, let alone establish a pH of 2.04. **This option is impossible.**\n\nThe only option that represents a chemically and mathematically valid state is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires finding the pair of values (acid volume and final pH) that is chemically consistent with dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in a final volume of 100 cm³. The most robust method, as demonstrated by the candidate answers, is to check which of the given options satisfies the mole balance for the acid (H⁺).\n\n### Principle of Analysis: Mole Balance\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid must be sufficient for two distinct purposes:\n1.  **Reaction:** An amount of H⁺ is consumed in the neutralization reaction with the solid Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Equilibrium:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the solution to maintain the final acidic pH, which prevents the dissolved Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out.\n\nThe governing equation for a consistent answer is:\n**(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining in Excess)**\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the H⁺ Consumed by Reaction\n\nThis is the stoichiometric part of the problem and is a fixed quantity.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.00093575 mol**.\n*   **Chemical Reaction**: The reaction is `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`. The key is the 1:3 mole ratio.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed by Reaction (`n_reacted`)**:\n    `n_reacted` = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.0028073 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Test Each Option for Self-Consistency\n\nNow, we check which option satisfies the mole balance equation.\n\n**A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = **0.002040 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The acid added (0.002040 mol) is less than the amount required just to react with the solid (0.0028073 mol). Therefore, the solid would not dissolve.\n*   **Verdict**: Inconsistent.\n\n**B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **H⁺ Remaining in Excess**: This is determined by the final pH in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume.\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   `n_excess` = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L ≈ **0.0002042 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required** = `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.0028073 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030115 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point**: Compare the H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) with the H⁺ required (0.0030115 mol). These values are nearly identical (a difference of ~0.08%, due to rounding in the problem's values).\n*   **Verdict**: Consistent.\n\n**C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The acid added (0.002805 mol) is insufficient to even complete the reaction (0.0028073 mol needed). Even a tiny excess would be needed to lower the pH, let alone to pH 2.04 which requires a significant excess.\n*   **Verdict**: Inconsistent.\n\n**D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added**: 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**.\n*   **H⁺ Remaining in Excess**: [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 0.000692 M. `n_excess` = 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = **0.0000692 mol**.\n*   **Total H⁺ Required** = `n_reacted` + `n_excess` = 0.0028073 mol + 0.0000692 mol = **0.0028765 mol**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The acid added (0.003214 mol) is not equal to the acid required (0.0028765 mol). The volume is too large for the resulting pH.\n*   **Verdict**: Inconsistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe systematic analysis confirms that only one option presents a chemically and mathematically self-consistent scenario. The volume of 30.09 cm³ provides almost exactly the required amount of acid to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to establish a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
