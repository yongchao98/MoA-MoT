The problem states that they orbit the same star ($T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$). This leads to a major simplification:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data:**\n    The semi-major axis can be found from the RV data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    *(This assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, and since the planets are detected via transit, the orbital inclination is ~90°, making $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.)*\n\n    Rearranging this formula to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n4.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3, we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Combining Formulas and Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel out, yielding the final, elegant formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts as a direct substitute for the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes.\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Numerical Result:**\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. All of this information is irrelevant for calculating the ratio, as these terms cancel out. This is a common method for testing a conceptual understanding of the physics.\n*   **The Power of Ratios:** The problem is made vastly simpler by using ratios, which cancel out physical constants (like G) and system parameters (like stellar mass). The goal is to find a simple final formula for the ratio without calculating intermediate values like `a` or `K` in absolute units.\n*   **Doppler Shift as a Proxy:** A key step is recognizing that the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$), as they are directly proportional.\n*   **Consistency Check:** All 15 candidate answers, despite choosing different letters, converged on the exact same numerical result (~0.536), which provides a very high degree of confidence in the calculation. The different letter choices stemmed from the agents seeing different multiple-choice option orderings.\n*   **Final Answer Matching:** It is critical to match the calculated numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the question prompt.\n\nThe calculated value of **~0.5357** is closest to the value presented in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the physical principles and mathematical derivation required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents receiving differently ordered multiple-choice options. The core calculation is robust and consistently yields the same numerical result.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**1. Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio. The simplified relationship becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star is related to its semi-major axis $a$. For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Rearranging to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i) G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nWe can now form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. All terms that are constant for both planets ($G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ as explained in the Careful Points below) cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Combine the Formulas and Solve**\nSubstitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leaving a simple final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. Now we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The question provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is extraneous and not needed for the final calculation because these terms cancel out when forming the necessary ratios. Including them is a common way to test understanding of the underlying physical relationships.\n*   **The Importance of the \"Transit Method\":** The problem states the planets were detected by *both* transit and RV methods. Detection by transit is crucial because it tells us the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. This means the orbital inclination ($i$) for both planets is approximately 90°, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This justifies removing the $\\sin(i)$ term from the ratio calculation.\n*   **Indices Check:** It is critical to keep the indices correct. The temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a_2/a_1}$. This inversion of indices (1/2 vs 2/1) is important and ultimately leads to the final expression containing the product of mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ and velocity ratio $K_1/K_2$.\n*   **Wavelength Shift vs. Velocity:** The problem provides the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) and not the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) in m/s. However, because these two quantities are directly proportional ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$), their ratio is identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to velocity is needed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a result of approximately **0.536**. Comparing this to the multiple-choice options provided in the question:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a universal consensus on the physical principles and mathematical derivation. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to shuffled option lists, but the numerical result is consistent across all agents who showed their work.

Define the Goal and Simplify the Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo (constant $A$), these terms cancel out when forming a ratio, along with the constant 2. The relationship simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now to find the ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe RV method provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular, transiting orbit ($i \\approx 90^\\circ, \\sin(i) \\approx 1$), the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) induced on the star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nBy squaring both sides and rearranging, we can solve for $a$:\n\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios for the Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel perfectly, leaving the final elegant equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Substitute Values and Compute the Result**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), so we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts for the ratio of velocities.\n\nGiven:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**5. Match Result to the Options**\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the provided list of options:\n*   A) ~ 0.53\n*   B) ~ 1.05\n*   C) ~ 1.30\n*   D) ~ 0.98\n\nThe value 0.536 is unambiguously closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The question provides several details that are not needed for the calculation (star's mass, radius, and temperature; planets' radii). Recognizing which variables cancel out is a key part of understanding the underlying physics.\n*   **Index Tracking**: It is crucial to keep the subscripts correct. Note how the final formula contains the mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ and the velocity ratio $K_1/K_2$. Swapping an index would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., the inverse, ~1.87).\n*   **Implication of \"Transit Method\"**: Mentioning the transit method is a vital clue. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, simplifying the RV formula.\n*   **Powers and Roots**: The derivation involves square roots and squared terms. The fact that they conveniently cancel each other out to produce a simple linear relationship in the final step is a key feature of this problem's structure.\n*   **Direct Proportionality**: You don't need the speed of light or the rest wavelength to solve this problem, only the understanding that the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, meaning their ratios are equal ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers shows an overwhelming consensus on the physical principles and mathematical derivation. The variation in the final letter choices is due to the agents receiving differently ordered multiple-choice options. The core calculation is robust and consistent across all analyses. Here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**: The primary goal is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    When forming the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (same $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) with the same albedo ($A$), all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    The problem is thus reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**: The semi-major axis `a` can be found using the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) induced by a planet of mass `M_p` is:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    By rearranging this, we can establish a proportionality for the semi-major axis:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**: Now we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}$\n\n4.  **Combine and Simplify the Equations**: Substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Apply Problem-Specific Information and Calculate**:\n    *   **Planet Masses**: $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses, $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses.\n    *   **Radial Velocities**: The maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), so the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4$.\n    *   **Inclinations**: This is a crucial point. The problem states the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed edge-on, so the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°. Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the inclination term $\\sin(i_2)/\\sin(i_1)$ becomes 1 and can be disregarded.\n\n    The simplified formula becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Final Numerical Result**:\n    $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: Much of the information given (the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii) is not needed for the final calculation. This is a common technique in physics problems to test a student's understanding of which variables are relevant.\n*   **Importance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is essential. It allows us to assume the orbital inclinations are ~90°, simplifying the radial velocity formula and allowing the `sin(i)` terms to cancel.\n*   **Doppler Shift vs. Velocity**: One must recognize that the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), so their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Equation Simplification**: The combination of the two main formulas leads to a convenient cancellation of the square roots and squares, resulting in a simple final expression. Performing this simplification correctly is key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is ~0.536. Matching this to the provided list of options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe result is closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the fifteen candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and mathematical derivation required to solve the problem. The discrepancy in the final letter choices stems from the fact that each agent was presented with a randomly ordered list of multiple-choice options. The numerical result itself is consistent across all solutions.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. The question asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This correctly shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes, $a$).\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be related to the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet with mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the RV signal it induces on the star ($K$) follows the proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}} $$\n    Since both planets are detected via the *transit method*, their orbits must be edge-on to us, meaning their inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Rearranging the proportionality to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**: Using the relationship from the previous step, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n4.  **Combine and Finalize the Temperature Ratio Formula**: Substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes (from Step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from Step 1):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, yielding a simple and elegant final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: The radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.

The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents being presented with randomized option lists. The scientific reasoning, however, is consistently sound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these common terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, the relation is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\nUsing this, we can form the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 3: Combine Formulas and Substitute Values\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\nAt this point, we must consider a few careful points:\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed for the calculation because they all cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Significance of \"Transit Method\"**: The problem states the planets were detected by the transit method. This is crucial because it means their orbits are viewed edge-on, so their inclinations are both approximately 90° ($i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90°$). Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the inclination term can be ignored.\n*   **Doppler Shift and Velocity**: The problem gives the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) not velocity ($K$). However, the two are directly proportional ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). This means the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nThe final, simplified formula is therefore:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis calculated value is closest to **~ 0.53**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the derivation, the numerical answer is ~0.536.

The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is a clear artifact of the agents working with differently ordered multiple-choice lists. The underlying scientific reasoning is consistent and robust.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step derivation of the correct answer, incorporating the correct logic found in the candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo (constant $A$), all these terms cancel out, along with the constant 2. This leaves a simplified relationship dependent only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet's orbit:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by a formula that can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$. This leads to the following proportionality:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\nWhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass and $K$ is the RV semi-amplitude.\n\nUsing this relationship, we can form the ratio for our two planets:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve**\nSubstitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ from Step 2 back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, which yields the final, simplified formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)$\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of velocities $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides excess data (stellar mass, radius, temperature; planetary radii; specific spectral line) that is not needed for the calculation. These values cancel out when forming the ratio.\n2.  **Correct Proportionalities:** It is critical to use the correct relationships: $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ and $a \\propto M_p^2 / K^2$. Any error in these powers would lead to an incorrect result.\n3.  **Index Management:** The final formula has mixed indices: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}$ and $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$. Careful algebraic derivation is necessary to avoid accidentally flipping one of these ratios.\n4.  **Simplification:** Recognizing that the square root and the squares cancel out is a key step that simplifies the calculation and prevents potential arithmetic errors.\n5.  **Doppler Shift Proxy:** It's important to understand that the ratio of Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$) is a valid proxy for the ratio of the underlying radial velocity semi-amplitudes ($K_1 / K_2$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and possess the same albedo ($A$ is the same), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe semi-major axis can be related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`, we find:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\nWe can now form the ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Expressions for the Final Formula**\n\nSubstitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes from Step 2 back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other, leaving a simple and direct relationship:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We can now plug in the values from the problem statement:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5 \\text{ M}_{Earth}}{7 \\text{ M}_{Earth}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**Step 5: Match the Result to the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

These are common in physics problems to test the understanding of which principles are relevant. All these terms cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Transit Method Implication**: The information that the planets were detected via the \"transit method\" is crucial because it implies their orbital inclinations ($i$) are close to 90 degrees. This means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which validates the use of the simplified RV relationship.\n*   **Key Simplifications**: The solution relies on two elegant simplifications. First, that for planets around the same star with the same albedo, $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$. Second, that combining this with the RV relationships leads to a final formula where the square roots cancel out, making the calculation straightforward.\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude vs. Doppler Shift**: The problem provides the maximum Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) and not the RV semi-amplitude in m/s ($K$). However, since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$, their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Goal Identification and Simplification\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and have the same albedo ($A$ is the same), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. The ratio of temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes, $a$).\n\n### Step 2: Relating Orbital Distance to Observation Data\nThe next step is to find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$ using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both planets were also detected via the *transit method*. This implies that their orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both, and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nWe can rearrange the proportionality to solve for $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n### Step 3: Combining Formulas\nNow we can form the ratio for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel out, leading to the final, simple formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We plug in the values from the question:\n\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, perform the calculation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line wavelength). These are included to test understanding of which variables are relevant for a *ratio* calculation.\n2.  **Importance of Transit Method**: The fact that the planets are transiting is key, as it allows us to assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, simplifying the RV equations.\n3.  **Correct Ratios**: It is essential to use the correct ratios in the final formula, i.e., ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) and ($K_1/K_2$), as derived. Mixing these up (e.g., using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$) would lead to an incorrect answer (the inverse, ~1.87).\n4.  **Consensus on Physics**: All candidate answers, regardless of their final letter choice, converge on the same physical derivation and the same numerical result of ~0.536.

The path to the correct solution is consistent and robust across all detailed responses.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task and Simplify the Formula**\n    The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The general formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Simplification):** Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and possess the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio. This leaves the much simpler relationship:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\n    The radial velocity (RV) data provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$).\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Irrelevant Data):** The problem provides extra information such as the star's absolute mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. These values are not needed to find the *ratio* and can be ignored, testing one's understanding of which variables cancel out.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Inclination):** The problem states the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods. Detection by transit implies an edge-on orbit, where the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This simplifies the RV equations.\n\n    The relationship between the variables can be expressed as: $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas and Perform Final Calculation**\n    Substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other out, leading to the elegant final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    Now, substitute the values from the problem. The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is the same as the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n    *   Ratio of planet masses ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) = 5 / 7\n    *   Ratio of Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The final step is to convert the fraction to a decimal and match it with the provided options.\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 4 (Consensus and Certainty):** The fact that all candidate agents who showed their work arrived at this same numerical result provides very high confidence in the correctness of the physics and the calculation.\n\n    We now match this result to the specific option list from the question:\n    A) ~ 0.53\n    B) ~ 0.98\n    C) ~ 1.05\n    D) ~ 1.30\n\n    The calculated value of ~0.5357 is unambiguously closest to **~ 0.53**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the fifteen candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the physics and the calculation required to solve the problem. Every agent who showed their work correctly derived the same formula and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately **0.536**. The only discrepancies arose from matching this number to the multiple-choice letters (A, B, C, or D), which indicates the agents were presented with randomized option lists.\n\nThe correct approach, synthesized from the consensus, is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Goal Identification**: The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**: The radial velocity (RV) method gives us the tools to find the ratio of the semi-major axes. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality: $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$. Rearranging this to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n4.  **Combine the Ratios**: Substitute the relationship for $a$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other out, leading to the final elegant formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. These are distractors; they are not needed for the ratio calculation because they cancel out.\n*   **Transit Method Implication**: The problem mentions the planets were found by the transit method. This is a crucial piece of information that justifies assuming an orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (and thus $\\sin i \\approx 1$), which is necessary for the radial velocity formula to be used without an unknown inclination angle.\n*   **Handling Ratios**: It is critical to keep the subscripts correct during the derivation. Note that the final ratio $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$ depends on the mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ (inverted) but the Doppler shift ratio $K_1/K_2$ (not inverted).\n*   **Algebraic Simplification**: The easiest way to solve the problem is to simplify the equations algebraically first, leading to the final simple formula. This avoids complex intermediate calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value is approximately **0.536**.

The following step-by-step solution synthesizes the correct reasoning demonstrated by the agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) and possess the same albedo (constant $A$), all these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the square root of the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit and a system detected by the transit method (where the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nBy rearranging this, we can express the semi-major axis in terms of the mass and velocity:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can now find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Formulas and Calculate the Final Ratio**\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other, leaving the final, simple formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. Plugging in the values from the question:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, we calculate the final temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**Step 5: Convert to Decimal and Select the Answer**\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nComparing this numerical result to the provided options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to **0.53**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed to calculate the final ratio (star's mass, radius, and temperature; planets' radii). These are designed to test the understanding of the underlying physics, as they cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Correct Subscripts**: It is critical to keep track of the subscripts (1 and 2). The final formula, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$, involves an inversion in the mass ratio term relative to the temperature ratio term. Accidentally flipping this term (using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$) would lead to an incorrect answer of 1.05, which is intentionally included as a distractor option.\n*   **Simplification with Ratios**: The problem is most efficiently solved by working with ratios from the beginning, which cancels out physical constants ($G$) and system parameters ($M_{star}$, $R_{star}$, $T_{star}$, $A$) immediately.\n*   **Transit Method Implication**: The mention of the transit method is a key piece of information. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, allowing the $\\sin(i)$ term in the full radial velocity formula to be taken as 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step derivation combining the formulas for a planet's equilibrium temperature and the radial velocity it induces on its star.

Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and possess the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This crucial simplification shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\n    The semi-major axis, `a`, can be related to the provided observational data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis by:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n    Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Rearranging the proportionality to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas and Solve**\n\n    Now, substitute the relationship for `a` into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    The square root and the squared terms cancel, yielding the final, simplified expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the measured maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts for the ratio of K.

Recognizing that these values cancel out is a key part of solving the problem efficiently and correctly.\n*   **Ratio Inversions**: It's crucial to keep the ratios correct. The temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) depends on the square root of the semi-major axis ratio ($a_2/a_1$), which in turn leads to the final dependence on the mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) and the velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2$). Mistaking any of these inversions would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Transit Method Importance**: The fact that the planets were detected via transits is important because it justifies assuming the orbital inclination `i` is ~90° (and sin(i) ≈ 1) for both, making their RV signatures directly comparable without an unknown inclination factor.\n*   **Formula Simplification**: The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a critical algebraic step.

Since both planets orbit the same star (making $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ constant for the ratio) and possess the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, the relationship is:\n\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nBy rearranging this proportionality to solve for the semi-major axis, we get:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 4: Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, leaving a simple final expression:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\nWe can now plug in the numerical values given in the question:\n*   Ratio of planet masses: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Ratio of Doppler shifts: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSubstitute these ratios into the final equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Irrelevant Information:** The problem provides a lot of data that is not needed for the final calculation (star's mass, radius, Teff; planets' radii). This is a common feature in physics problems to test a deep understanding of which variables are relevant to a ratio, as opposed to plugging all numbers into a formula.\n2.  **Simplification:** The key to solving this problem efficiently is to work with ratios and proportionalities. This allows for the cancellation of numerous physical constants ($G$) and system parameters ($M_{star}$, $R_{star}$, $T_{star}$, $A$) without needing to calculate them.\n3.  **Cancelling Powers:** A particularly elegant step in the derivation is when the square root in the temperature ratio formula cancels perfectly with the squares in the semi-major axis ratio formula. This simplifies the final calculation and reduces the potential for arithmetic errors.\n4.  **Doppler Shift vs. Velocity:** It's important to recognize that since the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($K$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). There is no need to calculate the actual velocities in m/s.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately **0.536**.

Rearranging this to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Calculation**\n    First, use the proportionality from Step 2 to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n    Next, substitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel out, yielding the simple, final formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, their ratio is identical: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n    We plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\nThe result is approximately **0.536**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem is intentionally filled with data that is not required for the final calculation (the star's absolute mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line at 6300 Å). Recognizing that these values cancel out when forming ratios is a key part of understanding the underlying physics.\n*   **The \"Transit Method\" Clue**: This is a vital piece of information, not a distractor. It justifies assuming the orbital inclination `i` is ~90°, which simplifies the RV formula by allowing us to take $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Index Tracking**: It is crucial to correctly track the subscripts (1 and 2) through the algebraic derivation. The final formula has mixed indices: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}$ but $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$. Accidentally inverting one of these ratios is a common pitfall that leads to incorrect distractor answers.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem's structure allows for a very elegant simplification where the square root in the temperature formula cancels out the squared terms from the RV formula. Solving the problem algebraically with ratios from the start is more efficient and less error-prone than calculating intermediate values for `a` or `K`.\n*   **Doppler Shift as Proxy**: One must understand that since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio of velocities ($K_1/K_2$) is the same as the ratio of wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).

The problem states that they orbit the same star ($T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$). This leads to a major simplification:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data:**\n    The semi-major axis can be found from the RV data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    *(This assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, and since the planets are detected via transit, the orbital inclination is ~90°, making $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.)*\n\n    Rearranging this formula to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n4.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3, we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Combining Formulas and Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root and the squares cancel out, yielding the final, elegant formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts as a direct substitute for the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes.\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Numerical Result:**\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. All of this information is irrelevant for calculating the ratio, as these terms cancel out. This is a common method for testing a conceptual understanding of the physics.\n*   **The Power of Ratios:** The problem is made vastly simpler by using ratios, which cancel out physical constants (like G) and system parameters (like stellar mass). The goal is to find a simple final formula for the ratio without calculating intermediate values like `a` or `K` in absolute units.\n*   **Doppler Shift as a Proxy:** A key step is recognizing that the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$), as they are directly proportional.\n*   **Consistency Check:** All 15 candidate answers, despite choosing different letters, converged on the exact same numerical result (~0.536), which provides a very high degree of confidence in the calculation.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents receiving differently ordered multiple-choice options. The core calculation is robust and consistently yields the same numerical result.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**1. Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio. The simplified relationship becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star is related to its semi-major axis $a$. For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Rearranging to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i) G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nWe can now form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. All terms that are constant for both planets ($G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ as explained in the Careful Points below) cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Combine the Formulas and Solve**\nSubstitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leaving a simple final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. Now we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The question provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is extraneous and not needed for the final calculation because these terms cancel out when forming the necessary ratios. Including them is a common way to test understanding of the underlying physical relationships.\n*   **The Importance of the \"Transit Method\":** The problem states the planets were detected by *both* transit and RV methods. Detection by transit is crucial because it tells us the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. This means the orbital inclination ($i$) for both planets is approximately 90°, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This justifies removing the $\\sin(i)$ term from the ratio calculation.\n*   **Indices Check:** It is critical to keep the indices correct. The temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{a_2/a_1}$. This inversion of indices (1/2 vs 2/1) is important and ultimately leads to the final expression containing the product of mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ and velocity ratio $K_1/K_2$.\n*   **Wavelength Shift vs. Velocity:** The problem provides the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) and not the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) in m/s. However, because these two quantities are directly proportional ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$), their ratio is identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to velocity is needed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a result of approximately **0.536**.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo (constant $A$), these terms cancel out when forming a ratio, along with the constant 2. The relationship simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now to find the ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe RV method provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular, transiting orbit ($i \\approx 90^\\circ, \\sin(i) \\approx 1$), the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) induced on the star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nBy squaring both sides and rearranging, we can solve for $a$:\n\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios for the Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel perfectly, leaving the final elegant equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Substitute Values and Compute the Result**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), so we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts for the ratio of velocities.\n\nGiven:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**5.

Recognizing which variables cancel out is a key part of understanding the underlying physics.\n*   **Index Tracking**: It is crucial to keep the subscripts correct. Note how the final formula contains the mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ and the velocity ratio $K_1/K_2$. Swapping an index would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., the inverse, ~1.87).\n*   **Implication of \"Transit Method\"**: Mentioning the transit method is a vital clue. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, simplifying the RV formula.\n*   **Powers and Roots**: The derivation involves square roots and squared terms. The fact that they conveniently cancel each other out to produce a simple linear relationship in the final step is a key feature of this problem's structure.\n*   **Direct Proportionality**: You don't need the speed of light or the rest wavelength to solve this problem, only the understanding that the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, meaning their ratios are equal ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers shows an overwhelming consensus on the physical principles and mathematical derivation. The variation in the final letter choices is due to the agents receiving differently ordered multiple-choice options. The core calculation is robust and consistent across all analyses. Here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**: The primary goal is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    When forming the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (same $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) with the same albedo ($A$), all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    The problem is thus reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**: The semi-major axis `a` can be found using the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) induced by a planet of mass `M_p` is:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    By rearranging this, we can establish a proportionality for the semi-major axis:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**: Now we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}$\n\n4.  **Combine and Simplify the Equations**: Substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Apply Problem-Specific Information and Calculate**:\n    *   **Planet Masses**: $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses, $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses.\n    *   **Radial Velocities**: The maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), so the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4$.\n    *   **Inclinations**: This is a crucial point. The problem states the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed edge-on, so the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°. Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the inclination term $\\sin(i_2)/\\sin(i_1)$ becomes 1 and can be disregarded.\n\n    The simplified formula becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Final Numerical Result**:\n    $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: Much of the information given (the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii) is not needed for the final calculation. This is a common technique in physics problems to test a student's understanding of which variables are relevant.\n*   **Importance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is essential. It allows us to assume the orbital inclinations are ~90°, simplifying the radial velocity formula and allowing the `sin(i)` terms to cancel.\n*   **Doppler Shift vs. Velocity**: One must recognize that the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), so their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Equation Simplification**: The combination of the two main formulas leads to a convenient cancellation of the square roots and squares, resulting in a simple final expression.

The numerical result itself is consistent across all solutions.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. The question asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This correctly shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes, $a$).\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be related to the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet with mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the RV signal it induces on the star ($K$) follows the proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}} $$\n    Since both planets are detected via the *transit method*, their orbits must be edge-on to us, meaning their inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Rearranging the proportionality to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**: Using the relationship from the previous step, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n4.  **Combine and Finalize the Temperature Ratio Formula**: Substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes (from Step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from Step 1):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, yielding a simple and elegant final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: The radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is irrelevant for calculating the ratio, as all these terms cancel out. This is a common feature in physics problems to test conceptual understanding.\n*   **The Transit Method Clue**: Stating that the planets were detected by the transit method is a critical clue that allows us to assume the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets.\n*   **Physical Relationships**: The key physical insights are that $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$ and that for a given star system, $a \\propto M_p^2 / K^2$.\n*   **Consensus is Key**: The unanimous agreement among all 15 candidate answers on the final numerical result (≈ 0.536) provides very high confidence in the correctness of the physics and the calculation.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculated numerical value is approximately **0.536**. Based on the options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value of 0.536 is unambiguously closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals an overwhelming consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps required to solve the problem. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents being presented with randomized option lists. The scientific reasoning, however, is consistently sound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these common terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, the relation is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\nUsing this, we can form the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 3: Combine Formulas and Substitute Values\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\nAt this point, we must consider a few careful points:\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed for the calculation because they all cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Significance of \"Transit Method\"**: The problem states the planets were detected by the transit method. This is crucial because it means their orbits are viewed edge-on, so their inclinations are both approximately 90° ($i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90°$). Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the inclination term can be ignored.\n*   **Doppler Shift and Velocity**: The problem gives the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) not velocity ($K$). However, the two are directly proportional ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). This means the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nThe final, simplified formula is therefore:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis calculated value is closest to **~ 0.53**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the derivation, the numerical answer is ~0.536.

The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is a clear artifact of the agents working with differently ordered multiple-choice lists. The underlying scientific reasoning is consistent and robust.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step derivation of the correct answer, incorporating the correct logic found in the candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo (constant $A$), all these terms cancel out, along with the constant 2. This leaves a simplified relationship dependent only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet's orbit:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by a formula that can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$. This leads to the following proportionality:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\nWhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass and $K$ is the RV semi-amplitude.\n\nUsing this relationship, we can form the ratio for our two planets:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve**\nSubstitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ from Step 2 back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, which yields the final, simplified formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)$\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of velocities $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides excess data (stellar mass, radius, temperature; planetary radii; specific spectral line) that is not needed for the calculation. These values cancel out when forming the ratio.\n2.  **Correct Proportionalities:** It is critical to use the correct relationships: $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ and $a \\propto M_p^2 / K^2$. Any error in these powers would lead to an incorrect result.\n3.  **Index Management:** The final formula has mixed indices: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}$ and $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$. Careful algebraic derivation is necessary to avoid accidentally flipping one of these ratios.\n4.  **Simplification:** Recognizing that the square root and the squares cancel out is a key step that simplifies the calculation and prevents potential arithmetic errors.\n5.  **Doppler Shift Proxy:** It's important to understand that the ratio of Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$) is a valid proxy for the ratio of the underlying radial velocity semi-amplitudes ($K_1 / K_2$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and possess the same albedo ($A$ is the same), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe semi-major axis can be related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`, we find:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\nWe can now form the ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Expressions for the Final Formula**\n\nSubstitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes from Step 2 back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other, leaving a simple and direct relationship:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We can now plug in the values from the problem statement:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5 \\text{ M}_{Earth}}{7 \\text{ M}_{Earth}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**Step 5: Match the Result to the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

These are common in physics problems to test the understanding of which principles are relevant. All these terms cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Transit Method Implication**: The information that the planets were detected via the \"transit method\" is crucial because it implies their orbital inclinations ($i$) are close to 90 degrees. This means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which validates the use of the simplified RV relationship.\n*   **Key Simplifications**: The solution relies on two elegant simplifications. First, that for planets around the same star with the same albedo, $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$. Second, that combining this with the RV relationships leads to a final formula where the square roots cancel out, making the calculation straightforward.\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude vs. Doppler Shift**: The problem provides the maximum Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) and not the RV semi-amplitude in m/s ($K$). However, since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$, their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Goal Identification and Simplification\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and have the same albedo ($A$ is the same), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. The ratio of temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes, $a$).\n\n### Step 2: Relating Orbital Distance to Observation Data\nThe next step is to find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$ using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both planets were also detected via the *transit method*. This implies that their orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both, and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nWe can rearrange the proportionality to solve for $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n### Step 3: Combining Formulas\nNow we can form the ratio for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel out, leading to the final, simple formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We plug in the values from the question:\n\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, perform the calculation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line wavelength). These are included to test understanding of which variables are relevant for a *ratio* calculation.\n2.  **Importance of Transit Method**: The fact that the planets are transiting is key, as it allows us to assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, simplifying the RV equations.\n3.  **Correct Ratios**: It is essential to use the correct ratios in the final formula, i.e., ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) and ($K_1/K_2$), as derived. Mixing these up (e.g., using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$) would lead to an incorrect answer (the inverse, ~1.87).\n4.  **Consensus on Physics**: All candidate answers, regardless of their final letter choice, converge on the same physical derivation and the same numerical result of ~0.536.

The path to the correct solution is consistent and robust across all detailed responses.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task and Simplify the Formula**\n    The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The general formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Simplification):** Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and possess the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio. This leaves the much simpler relationship:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\n    The radial velocity (RV) data provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$).\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Irrelevant Data):** The problem provides extra information such as the star's absolute mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. These values are not needed to find the *ratio* and can be ignored, testing one's understanding of which variables cancel out.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Inclination):** The problem states the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods. Detection by transit implies an edge-on orbit, where the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.

The only discrepancies arose from matching this number to the multiple-choice letters (A, B, C, or D), which indicates the agents were presented with randomized option lists.\n\nThe correct approach, synthesized from the consensus, is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Goal Identification**: The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**: The radial velocity (RV) method gives us the tools to find the ratio of the semi-major axes. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality: $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$. Rearranging this to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n4.  **Combine the Ratios**: Substitute the relationship for $a$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other out, leading to the final elegant formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. These are distractors; they are not needed for the ratio calculation because they cancel out.\n*   **Transit Method Implication**: The problem mentions the planets were found by the transit method. This is a crucial piece of information that justifies assuming an orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (and thus $\\sin i \\approx 1$), which is necessary for the radial velocity formula to be used without an unknown inclination angle.\n*   **Handling Ratios**: It is critical to keep the subscripts correct during the derivation. Note that the final ratio $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$ depends on the mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ (inverted) but the Doppler shift ratio $K_1/K_2$ (not inverted).\n*   **Algebraic Simplification**: The easiest way to solve the problem is to simplify the equations algebraically first, leading to the final simple formula. This avoids complex intermediate calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value is approximately **0.536**.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the agents being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The following step-by-step solution synthesizes the correct reasoning demonstrated by the agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) and possess the same albedo (constant $A$), all these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the square root of the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit and a system detected by the transit method (where the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), the formula simplifies to the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nBy rearranging this, we can express the semi-major axis in terms of the mass and velocity:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can now find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Formulas and Calculate the Final Ratio**\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other, leaving the final, simple formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. Plugging in the values from the question:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, we calculate the final temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**Step 5: Convert to Decimal and Select the Answer**\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nComparing this numerical result to the provided options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to **0.53**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed to calculate the final ratio (star's mass, radius, and temperature; planets' radii). These are designed to test the understanding of the underlying physics, as they cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Correct Subscripts**: It is critical to keep track of the subscripts (1 and 2). The final formula, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$, involves an inversion in the mass ratio term relative to the temperature ratio term. Accidentally flipping this term (using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$) would lead to an incorrect answer of 1.05, which is intentionally included as a distractor option.\n*   **Simplification with Ratios**: The problem is most efficiently solved by working with ratios from the beginning, which cancels out physical constants ($G$) and system parameters ($M_{star}$, $R_{star}$, $T_{star}$, $A$) immediately.\n*   **Transit Method Implication**: The mention of the transit method is a key piece of information. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, allowing the $\\sin(i)$ term in the full radial velocity formula to be taken as 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step derivation combining the formulas for a planet's equilibrium temperature and the radial velocity it induces on its star. The analysis of the provided answers shows a remarkable consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps, with discrepancies only arising from the assignment of the final result to a multiple-choice letter (likely due to shuffled option lists).

Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and possess the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This crucial simplification shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\n    The semi-major axis, `a`, can be related to the provided observational data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis by:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n    Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Rearranging the proportionality to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas and Solve**\n\n    Now, substitute the relationship for `a` into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    The square root and the squared terms cancel, yielding the final, simplified expression:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the measured maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts for the ratio of K. We are given:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    To get the decimal value:\n    ```python\n    print(15/28)\n    ```\n    <execute_code>\n    0.5357142857142857\n    </execute_code>\n    The ratio is approximately 0.5357.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed to calculate the ratio (the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii). Recognizing that these values cancel out is a key part of solving the problem efficiently and correctly.\n*   **Ratio Inversions**: It's crucial to keep the ratios correct. The temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) depends on the square root of the semi-major axis ratio ($a_2/a_1$), which in turn leads to the final dependence on the mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) and the velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2$). Mistaking any of these inversions would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Transit Method Importance**: The fact that the planets were detected via transits is important because it justifies assuming the orbital inclination `i` is ~90° (and sin(i) ≈ 1) for both, making their RV signatures directly comparable without an unknown inclination factor.\n*   **Formula Simplification**: The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a critical algebraic step.

Since both planets orbit the same star (making $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ constant for the ratio) and possess the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, the relationship is:\n\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nBy rearranging this proportionality to solve for the semi-major axis, we get:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 4: Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, leaving a simple final expression:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}}\\right)$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$).

This is a common feature in physics problems to test a deep understanding of which variables are relevant to a ratio, as opposed to plugging all numbers into a formula.\n2.  **Simplification:** The key to solving this problem efficiently is to work with ratios and proportionalities. This allows for the cancellation of numerous physical constants ($G$) and system parameters ($M_{star}$, $R_{star}$, $T_{star}$, $A$) without needing to calculate them.\n3.  **Cancelling Powers:** A particularly elegant step in the derivation is when the square root in the temperature ratio formula cancels perfectly with the squares in the semi-major axis ratio formula. This simplifies the final calculation and reduces the potential for arithmetic errors.\n4.  **Doppler Shift vs. Velocity:** It's important to recognize that since the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($K$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).

Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe RV method provides the necessary information.
