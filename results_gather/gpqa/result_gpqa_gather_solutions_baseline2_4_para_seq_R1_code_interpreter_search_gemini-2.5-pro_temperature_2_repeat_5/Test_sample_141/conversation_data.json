For a single qubit, this position is uniquely described by the Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, which gives the coordinates of the state within the Bloch sphere.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix**: The first, and most important, step is to simplify the expression for $\\rho$.\n    *   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is a sum of projection operators over the complete computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$.\n    *   This is an example of the **completeness relation** in quantum mechanics, which states that $\\sum_i |i\\rangle\\langle i| = I$ for any complete orthonormal basis $\\{|i\\rangle\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, the expression simplifies directly to the identity matrix, $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the formula for $\\rho$, we get: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector**: There is a standard formula that relates any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ to its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. We can find $\\vec{r}$ by setting our simplified density matrix equal to this general form.\n    \n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\n    Multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting $I$ gives:\n    \n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    \n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n    For this equation to hold, all the coefficients ($r_x, r_y, r_z$) must be zero, because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. Thus, we find that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Match to Options**: The final step is to compare the calculated result, $\\vec{r} = (0,0,0)$, with the multiple-choice options provided in the question.\n    A) r=(1,1,0)\n    B) r=(1,1,1)\n    C) r=(0,0,1)\n    D) r=(0,0,0)\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Recognizing the Identity Operator**: The most critical shortcut is identifying that the expression $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is simply the identity operator, $I$. This immediately simplifies the density matrix to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n2.  **Physical Interpretation**: The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is known as the **maximally mixed state**. Physically, it represents a state of complete ignorance or a 50/50 classical mixture of finding the qubit in state $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$. Geometrically, this state of maximum uncertainty corresponds to the exact center (origin) of the Bloch sphere, providing a strong intuition that the Bloch vector must be $(0,0,0)$.\n3.  **Properties of Pauli Matrices**: The final step of the calculation, where $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$ implies $\\vec{r} = (0,0,0)$, relies on the fundamental property that the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. An alternative calculation using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$ relies on another fundamental property: that the Pauli matrices are traceless (i.e., $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_k)=0$). Both methods give the same result.\n4.  **Analyzing Candidate Discrepancies**: The provided candidate answers all correctly calculate the Bloch vector as $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. The variation in their final letter choice (e.g., A, B, C, or D) is an artifact caused by the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each of them. The crucial observation is the unanimous agreement on the *mathematical result*, which confirms its validity. The final answer should be derived by matching this correct mathematical result to the specific list of options given in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating a list of careful points derived from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Simplify the Density Matrix Expression:**\nThe problem starts with the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\nThe term in the parentheses, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, represents the sum of the projection operators for a complete orthonormal basis of a single-qubit system. This sum is known as the completeness relation and is always equal to the identity operator, $I$.\nIn matrix form: $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTherefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n**2. Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector:**\nThe \"geometrical position\" of a single qubit is described by its Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ and its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the general formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n**3. Calculate the Bloch Vector:**\nWe can find the components of $\\vec{r}$ by equating the simplified density matrix from Step 1 with the general formula from Step 2.\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting the identity matrix $I$ gives:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\nThis expands to $r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSince the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for their weighted sum to be the zero matrix is if all the scalar coefficients ($r_x, r_y, r_z$) are zero.\nTherefore, $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**4. Match the Result to the Options:**\nThe calculated geometrical position is the vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. This corresponds to the origin (center) of the Bloch sphere. Now, we match this result to the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,0)\nB) r=(0,0,0)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(1,1,1)\nThe calculated result matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, here are the most important points to ensure correctness:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Completeness Relation:** The most crucial first step is to correctly identify that the sum of projectors $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ simplifies to the identity matrix $I$. This immediately makes the problem tractable.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Physical Interpretation as a Sanity Check:** The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the maximally mixed state, representing complete uncertainty or randomness. Intuitively, a state with no preferred direction should lie at the geometric center of the space, which is the origin. This provides a strong conceptual check that the answer should be $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Properties of Pauli Matrices:** The final step of the calculation relies on a key property of the Pauli matrices: either their **linear independence** (if using the comparison method) or that they are **traceless** (if using the trace formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho\\sigma_k)$). Both lead to the same conclusion.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Resolving Answer Inconsistencies:** The candidate answers show unanimous agreement on the *calculation* that $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$, but disagree on the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent. The correct procedure is to ignore the agents' letter choices, trust the robust mathematical result, and map it to the options as presented in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a comprehensive step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Density Matrix**\nThe problem starts with the density matrix given in Dirac notation: $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n\nThe first step is to simplify this expression. The term inside the parenthesis, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, represents the sum of the projection operators onto the computational basis states $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Completeness Relation.** A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is the completeness relation, which states that for any complete orthonormal basis $\\{|i\\rangle\\}$, the sum of the projectors $\\sum_i |i\\rangle\\langle i|$ is equal to the identity operator, $I$. All candidate answers correctly applied this principle, recognizing that $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = I$.\n\nThis simplifies the density matrix significantly to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the Maximally Mixed State.** The density matrix $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the unique representation of the **maximally mixed state**. Physically, this state represents a 50% classical probability of being in state $|0\\rangle$ and a 50% probability of being in state $|1\\rangle$, with no quantum coherence. Conceptually, this state represents complete uncertainty and has no preferred direction in space. This physical intuition suggests its geometrical position should be at the origin.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nThe \"geometrical position\" of a single qubit state is its Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between the density matrix $\\rho$ and the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the general formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\nWe can solve for $\\vec{r}$ by equating our simplified density matrix with this general formula:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides, we get:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Linear Independence of Pauli Matrices.** The Pauli matrices, along with the identity matrix, form a basis for the space of 2x2 complex matrices. A key property is their linear independence. For the equation $r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z = 0$ to hold true, all scalar coefficients must be zero. This directly leads to the conclusion that $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$.\n\nAn alternative, but equivalent, method is to use the trace formula for the components: $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n\n*   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$\n*   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$\n*   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$\n\nThis confirms the result because all Pauli matrices are traceless (i.e., the sum of their diagonal elements is zero). Both methods consistently and robustly yield the same result: $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Final Decision**\nThe calculated Bloch vector, representing the geometrical position, is $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. This corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Mapping the Result to the Options.** An analysis of the candidate answers shows they unanimously reached the same mathematical result of $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. However, their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) were inconsistent. This indicates that the options were presented to them in a different order. The correct final step is to take the robust mathematical conclusion, $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$, and map it to the specific list of options provided in the question prompt.\n\nThe options are:\nA) r=(0,0,0)\nB) r=(0,0,1)\nC) r=(1,1,0)\nD) r=(1,1,1)\n\nThe calculated vector matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Simplify the Density Matrix.** The first step is to simplify the expression for the density matrix, $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n    *   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is a sum of projection operators onto a complete orthonormal basis for a single qubit. This sum is always equal to the identity operator, $I$. This is a fundamental property in quantum mechanics known as the completeness relation.\n    *   Thus, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. In matrix form, this is $\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n2.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector.** The \"geometrical position\" of a single-qubit state is described by its Bloch vector, $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ and its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the general formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector.** We can find the components of the Bloch vector by equating our specific density matrix from Step 1 with the general formula from Step 2.\n    *   Setting the expressions equal: $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    *   Multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting the identity matrix $I$ from both sides gives: $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$, which simplifies to $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$.\n    *   Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for their weighted sum to be equal to the zero matrix is if all the scalar coefficients are zero.

For a single qubit, this position is described by its **Bloch vector**, denoted as $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, which specifies the state's coordinates within the Bloch sphere.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:** The first and most critical step is to simplify the given expression for the density matrix:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n    The term inside the parenthesis, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, represents the sum of projection operators onto a complete orthonormal basis for a single qubit. This sum is a fundamental identity in quantum mechanics and is always equal to the identity operator, $I$.\n    Thus, the density matrix simplifies to:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector from the Density Matrix:** The general relationship between a single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ and its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n    We can find $\\vec{r}$ by equating our specific density matrix from Step 2 with this general formula:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    Multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ (where 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix).\n\n    Since the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) are linearly independent, the only way for a weighted sum of them to equal the zero matrix is if all the coefficients are zero.\n    Therefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n    The Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Match the Result to the Options:** The calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.

This position is given by the Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:** The first crucial step is to simplify the expression for $\\rho$.\n    *   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is a sum of projection operators over a complete orthonormal basis of the qubit space ($\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$). This is an application of the completeness relation, which states that this sum is equal to the identity operator, $I$.\n    *   Thus, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector from the Density Matrix:** The general relationship between a single-qubit density matrix and its Bloch vector is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n    As shown consistently across all candidate answers, there are two common and correct methods to solve for $\\vec{r}$:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Direct Comparison**\n        We set the specific density matrix equal to the general formula:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n        Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for their weighted sum to be the zero matrix is if all the coefficients ($r_x, r_y, r_z$) are zero. Therefore, $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Trace Formula**\n        The components of the Bloch vector can be found using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        Both methods yield the same unambiguous result: $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculation robustly shows that the geometrical position is the vector $\\vec{r} = (0,0,0)$. This corresponds to the origin, or the exact center, of the Bloch sphere. We now match this result to the provided options.\n\n    A) r=(0,0,0)\n    B) r=(0,0,1)\n    C) r=(1,1,0)\n    D) r=(1,1,1)\n\n    The calculated vector (0,0,0) corresponds to option **A**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Recognizing the Identity Operator:** The most important simplification is to recognize that $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\hiderangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = I$. This immediately simplifies the density matrix and is the fastest path to a solution.\n2.  **Physical Interpretation of the State:** The density matrix $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ represents the maximally mixed state. This state corresponds to a completely random qubit, with a 50% chance of being measured in state $|0\\rangle$ and a 50% chance of being in state $|1\\rangle$. Geometrically, this complete uncertainty means the state has no preferred direction and must lie at the center of the Bloch sphere, which has coordinates (0,0,0).\n3.  **Correctness of the Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers, despite their final letter choices, unanimously agree on the mathematical steps and the resulting Bloch vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. This shows the calculation is robust and standard.\n4.  **Resolving Inconsistent Options:** The variation in the final letters (A, B, C, D) chosen by the candidate agents is due to the fact that the multiple-choice options were randomized for each of them.

For a single qubit, this position is uniquely described by its **Bloch vector**, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n**2. Simplify the Density Matrix**\n\nThe first, most crucial step is to simplify the given expression for $\\rho$.\n*   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ represents the sum of the projection operators for a complete orthonormal basis, $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$.\n*   In matrix form, with $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n    $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$\n*   This sum is always equal to the identity operator, $I$. This property is known as the completeness relation.\n*   Substituting this into the expression for $\\rho$, we get:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\n**3. Calculate the Bloch Vector ($\\vec{r}$)**\n\nThe general relationship between a single-qubit density matrix and its Bloch vector is:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\nWe can now find $\\vec{r}$ by equating our simplified density matrix with the general formula:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting $I$ gives:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\nSince the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for their weighted sum to be the zero matrix is if all the scalar coefficients are zero. Therefore:\n$r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\nThe resulting Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**4. Match the Result to the Options**\n\nThe calculation unambiguously shows that the geometrical position is the vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. This corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere.

This instantly simplifies the problem.\n2.  **The Maximally Mixed State:** The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is known as the maximally mixed state. Physically, it represents a state of complete uncertainty or ignorance, with a 50% probability of being measured in any state. Its correct geometric position is at the very center of the Bloch sphere, which has coordinates (0,0,0). Recognizing this provides an immediate conceptual check on the calculation.\n3.  **Linear Independence of Pauli Matrices:** The mathematical conclusion that $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 0$ implies $\\vec{r} = (0,0,0)$ depends critically on the fact that the Pauli matrices are linearly independent.\n4.  **Analyzing Discrepancies in Candidate Answers:** The candidate answers unanimously agree on the mathematical result $\\vec{r} = (0,0,0)$. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, D) is not due to any error in their understanding of physics but is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, random order for each agent.

For a single qubit, this position is given by the **Bloch vector** $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, which maps the state to a point in a 3D space called the Bloch sphere.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix Expression**: The given density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\hskip-0.3ex\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n    *   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\hskip-0.3ex\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is a sum of projection operators over a complete orthonormal basis (the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$). A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that this sum is equal to the identity operator, $I$.\n    *   Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. In matrix form, this is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This specific state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector**: The relationship between any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ and its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is defined by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$.\n    *   We substitute our simplified density matrix into this equation:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    *   Multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting the identity matrix $I$ gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ (where 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix)\n    *   The Pauli matrices are linearly independent. This means the only way a weighted sum of them can equal the zero matrix is if all the coefficients (the components of $\\vec{r}$) are zero.\n    *   Thus, we must have $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This vector corresponds to the origin, or the exact center of the Bloch sphere. We now match this result to the given options.\n    *   A) r=(1,1,1)\n    *   B) r=(0,0,1)\n    *   C) r=(0,0,0)\n    *   D) r=(1,1,0)\n    The calculated vector matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Maximally Mixed State**: The most efficient first step is to recognize that $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = I$. This immediately simplifies the density matrix to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$, which represents the maximally mixed state. Knowing this allows for a direct conceptual leap: a state of complete uncertainty has no preferred direction and must therefore be at the center of the Bloch sphere, where $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Correct Application of Formulas**: The calculation relies on the correct application of the formula relating the density matrix to the Bloch vector, $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, and the property that the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. An alternative method using the trace formula, $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$, is also effective and relies on the fact that all Pauli matrices are traceless.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Resolving Candidate Answer Discrepancies**: The provided candidate answers all reach the same mathematical result: $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. Their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent because the multiple-choice options were presented to them in a different order. This is a superficial error.

This immediately makes the problem tractable.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Physical Interpretation as a Sanity Check:** The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the maximally mixed state, representing complete uncertainty or randomness. Intuitively, a state with no preferred direction should lie at the geometric center of the space, which is the origin. This provides a strong conceptual check that the answer should be $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Properties of Pauli Matrices:** The final step of the calculation relies on a key property of the Pauli matrices: either their **linear independence** (if using the comparison method) or that they are **traceless** (if using the trace formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho\\sigma_k)$). Both lead to the same conclusion.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Resolving Answer Inconsistencies:** The candidate answers show unanimous agreement on the *calculation* that $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$, but disagree on the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent. The correct procedure is to ignore the agents' letter choices, trust the robust mathematical result, and map it to the options as presented in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a comprehensive step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Density Matrix**\nThe problem starts with the density matrix given in Dirac notation: $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n\nThe first step is to simplify this expression. The term inside the parenthesis, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, represents the sum of the projection operators onto the computational basis states $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Completeness Relation.** A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is the completeness relation, which states that for any complete orthonormal basis $\\{|i\\rangle\\}$, the sum of the projectors $\\sum_i |i\\rangle\\langle i|$ is equal to the identity operator, $I$. All candidate answers correctly applied this principle, recognizing that $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = I$.\n\nThis simplifies the density matrix significantly to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the Maximally Mixed State.** The density matrix $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the unique representation of the **maximally mixed state**. Physically, this state represents a 50% classical probability of being in state $|0\\rangle$ and a 50% probability of being in state $|1\\rangle$, with no quantum coherence. Conceptually, this state represents complete uncertainty and has no preferred direction in space. This physical intuition suggests its geometrical position should be at the origin.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Bloch Vector**\nThe \"geometrical position\" of a single qubit state is its Bloch vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between the density matrix $\\rho$ and the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the general formula:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\nWe can solve for $\\vec{r}$ by equating our simplified density matrix with this general formula:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nMultiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides, we get:\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Linear Independence of Pauli Matrices.** The Pauli matrices, along with the identity matrix, form a basis for the space of 2x2 complex matrices. A key property is their linear independence. For the equation $r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z = 0$ to hold true, all scalar coefficients must be zero. This directly leads to the conclusion that $r_x=0$, $r_y=0$, and $r_z=0$.\n\nAn alternative, but equivalent, method is to use the trace formula for the components: $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n\n*   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$\n*   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$\n*   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$\n\nThis confirms the result because all Pauli matrices are traceless (i.e., the sum of their diagonal elements is zero). Both methods consistently and robustly yield the same result: $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Final Decision**\nThe calculated Bloch vector, representing the geometrical position, is $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. This corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Mapping the Result to the Options.** An analysis of the candidate answers shows they unanimously reached the same mathematical result of $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. However, their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) were inconsistent. This indicates that the options were presented to them in a different order. The correct final step is to take the robust mathematical conclusion, $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$, and map it to the specific list of options provided in the question prompt.\n\nThe options are:\nA) r=(0,0,0)\nB) r=(0,0,1)\nC) r=(1,1,0)\nD) r=(1,1,1)\n\nThe calculated vector matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Simplify the Density Matrix.** The first step is to simplify the expression for the density matrix, $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n    *   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is a sum of projection operators onto a complete orthonormal basis for a single qubit. This sum is always equal to the identity operator, $I$. This is a fundamental property in quantum mechanics known as the completeness relation.\n    *   Thus, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. In matrix form, this is $\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n2.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector.** The \"geometrical position\" of a single-qubit state is described by its Bloch vector, $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The relationship between any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ and its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the general formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector.** We can find the components of the Bloch vector by equating our specific density matrix from Step 1 with the general formula from Step 2.\n    *   Setting the expressions equal: $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    *   Multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting the identity matrix $I$ from both sides gives: $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$, which simplifies to $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$.\n    *   Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for their weighted sum to be equal to the zero matrix is if all the scalar coefficients are zero.

In the standard representation of a single qubit, this position is given by the **Bloch vector** $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:** The first and most important step is to simplify the given expression for $\\rho$.\n    *   The term in parentheses, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, is a sum of projection operators over a complete orthonormal basis ($|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$). This sum is known as the completeness relation and is always equal to the identity operator, $I$.\n    *   Explicitly, in the standard matrix basis where $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, we have:\n        $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$\n    *   Substituting this result into the original expression for $\\rho$ yields:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n    *   This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector ($\\vec{r}$):** The general relationship between a single-qubit density matrix and its Bloch vector is given by the formula $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   **Method 1: Direct Comparison.** We can set our specific density matrix equal to the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation can only be true if all the scalar coefficients are zero. Therefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Trace Formula.** Alternatively, we can calculate the components using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$:\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   Both methods unambiguously show that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated geometrical position is the vector `(0,0,0)`, which corresponds to the origin or center of the Bloch sphere.

This immediately simplifies the problem.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Physical Interpretation.** The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the maximally mixed state, representing complete uncertainty or a 50/50 classical mixture of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. Geometrically, a state of complete indifference should lie at the exact center of the Bloch sphere, providing a strong conceptual check that the answer should be $(0,0,0)$.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Mathematical Properties of Pauli Matrices.** The calculation relies on two fundamental properties of the Pauli matrices: their **linear independence** (used in Method 1) and them being **traceless** (used in Method 2).

All candidate answers use one of two equivalent and correct methods.\n    *   **Method 1 (Direct Comparison):**\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ (where 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix).\n        Since the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) are linearly independent, the only way for their weighted sum to be zero is if all the coefficients ($r_x, r_y, r_z$) are zero. Therefore, $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    *   **Method 2 (Trace Formula):**\n        The components of the Bloch vector are given by $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_k)$.\n        Since all Pauli matrices are traceless ($\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_k) = 0$), this immediately gives $r_x = r_y = r_z = 0$. Thus, $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both methods unambiguously show that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.

For a single qubit, this position is given by the **Bloch vector** $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, which maps the state to a point in a 3D space called the Bloch sphere.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix Expression**: The given density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\hskip-0.3ex\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n    *   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\hskip-0.3ex\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is a sum of projection operators over a complete orthonormal basis (the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$).

This sum is always equal to the identity operator, $I$.\n    *   To be explicit, in the standard matrix representation where $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n        $|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n    *   Substituting this result into the original expression for $\\rho$ gives:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n    *   This is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector (`r`):** The general relationship between a single-qubit density matrix and its Bloch vector is:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n    We can now solve for $\\vec{r}$ by equating the specific density matrix we found with the general formula.\n    *   **Method A (Direct Comparison):**\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$.\n        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for this equation to hold true is if all the coefficients are zero: $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, $r_z = 0$.\n\n    *   **Method B (Trace Formula):**\n        The components of the Bloch vector can also be found using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$:\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0$.\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0$.\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 0$.\n    Both methods unambiguously show that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Match with Provided Options:** The final step is to match the calculated vector $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$ to the multiple-choice options given in the question.\n    A) r=(1,1,1)\n    B) r=(0,0,0)\n    C) r=(1,1,0)\n    D) r=(0,0,1)\n    The calculated vector matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Recognizing the Identity Operator:** The most efficient starting point is to recognize that the completeness relation $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is equal to the identity matrix $I$. This immediately identifies the state as $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n2.  **Physical Interpretation:** The maximally mixed state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ represents complete uncertainty about the state of the qubit. Geometrically, this state of total randomness has no preferred direction and therefore lies at the origin (center) of the Bloch sphere, providing a strong intuition that its Bloch vector must be $(0, 0, 0)$.\n3.  **Properties of Pauli Matrices:** The derivation relies on fundamental properties of the Pauli matrices: their **linear independence** (used in the comparison method) and the fact that they are **traceless** (used in the trace formula method).\n4.  **Analyzing Conflicting Agent Answers:** The candidate answers unanimously agree on the mathematical result ($\\vec{r} = (0,0,0)$) but provide different letter answers (A, B, C, D). This indicates that the options were presented in a different, random order to each agent. The correct procedure is to ignore their final letter choices, trust the unanimous mathematical reasoning, and match the correct result to the options provided in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the reasoning from all the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The question asks for the \"geometrical position\" of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$ in the space of qubits. This is a standard request for the state's **Bloch vector**, denoted as $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Density Matrix:** The first, and most crucial, step is to simplify the expression for $\\rho$.\n    *   The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is a sum of projection operators over a complete orthonormal basis for a single qubit. This is known as the completeness relation, and this sum is always equal to the **identity operator**, $I$.\n    *   In matrix form, $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Their sum is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\n    *   Substituting this into the expression for the density matrix yields:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This is the density matrix for the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:** Any single-qubit density matrix can be represented in terms of its Bloch vector using the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. There are two robust methods to solve for $\\vec{r}$.\n\n    *   **Method A (Direct Comparison):** Set our simplified density matrix equal to the general form:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n        Multiplying by 2 and subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n        Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for this equation to hold true is if all scalar coefficients are zero. Therefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\n    *   **Method B (Trace Formula):** The components of the Bloch vector can be found using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$.\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n\n    Both methods consistently and unambiguously show that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated geometrical position is the vector `(0, 0, 0)`. We now match this result to the given options:\n    A) r=(1,1,0)\n    B) r=(1,1,1)\n    C) r=(0,0,1)\n    D) r=(0,0,0)\n    The calculated vector corresponds to option D.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Simplification):** The key to solving this problem efficiently is to immediately recognize that the sum of projectors onto a complete basis, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$, is simply the identity matrix $I$.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Physical Interpretation):** The state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ is the maximally mixed state, representing a state of complete ignorance or a uniform probabilistic mixture. Geometrically, this state has no preferred direction and thus must lie at the origin (center) of the Bloch sphere, giving an intuitive check for the result $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Mathematical Properties):** The calculation relies on fundamental properties of the Pauli matrices: either their **linear independence** (for the comparison method) or the fact that they are **traceless** (for the trace formula method).\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Candidate Answer Discrepancy):** All 15 candidate answers unanimously agree on the mathematical result, $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. The variance in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is a clear artifact of the options being shuffled in their respective prompts. Therefore, the core reasoning is sound and consistent; the final step is to map the correct, universally agreed-upon result to the specific options provided here.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
