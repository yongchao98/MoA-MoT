Such reactions in particle physics are governed by the principles of **Conservation of Energy** and **Conservation of Momentum**, framed within Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**:\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a standard physics problem convention meaning its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. To conserve momentum (the initial momentum is effectively zero), we analyze the event in the center-of-mass frame where both particles are considered to be at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is simply the sum of the rest energies of the two particles. The rest energy of a proton is a known physical constant, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$. The antiproton has an identical rest energy.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Determine Energy of Final Particles ($E_A$)**:\n    *   According to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is completely converted into the total energy of the four final particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$).\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum was zero), the final energy must be distributed symmetrically. This means the energy is divided equally among the four product particles, which all share the same mass.\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a single particle A is therefore:\n        $E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A ($v$)**:\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $m_A c^2$ is the rest energy of particle A, given as $300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Plugging in our calculated value for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n\n5.  **Final Result**: The calculated velocity is $v \\approx 0.769c$. Rounding to two decimal places gives **0.77c**. This result is consistently found across all candidate answers, indicating a high degree of confidence in the method.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Slowly Moving\"**: This phrase is a crucial simplifying assumption. It allows one to neglect the initial kinetic energy and consider the initial total energy to be purely the rest energy of the proton-antiproton pair.\n2.  **Role of Momentum Conservation**: While the primary calculation uses energy conservation, momentum conservation is essential for justifying the symmetric, equal-energy distribution among the four final particles.\n3.  **Use of Relativistic Formulas**: The kinetic energy of each final particle ($E_K = E_A - m_A c^2 \\approx 169$ MeV) is a significant fraction of its rest energy (300 MeV). This signifies that the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, making the use of relativistic energy formulas ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) mandatory.\n4.  **Distinguishing Energy Types**: It is critical to distinguish between a particle's rest energy ($m_A c^2$) and its total relativistic energy ($E_A$). The velocity is derived from the relationship between these two values via the Lorentz factor.\n5.  **Analyzing Candidate Answers**: The consensus on the numerical result (~0.77c) among all candidate answers confirms the calculation's validity. The disagreement on the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is an artifact of the options being presented in a different order to each agent and should be disregarded. The final answer must be based on matching the calculated result to the specific list of options in the problem statement.\n\nMatching the calculated velocity of **0.77c** to the provided options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps required to solve the problem. The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) among the candidate answers is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented to them in a different, randomized order. The core physics calculation is sound and consistent across all candidates.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles**: The problem describes a proton-antiproton annihilation. This process is governed by the conservation of relativistic energy and the conservation of momentum.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{final}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The system begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The condition that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\" is a standard simplification in particle physics problems. It implies that its initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy.\n    *   To conserve momentum (the initial total momentum must be close to zero), we analyze the event in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two particles. A proton and antiproton have identical masses. The rest energy of a proton is a known physical constant, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State**: The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   All four particles have the same mass, with a given rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   By conservation of momentum and symmetry (since $\\vec{p}_{initial} = 0$), the initial energy must be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is therefore one-quarter of the total initial energy:\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$. This is the total relativistic energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) of one particle A.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**: The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined in terms of velocity ($v$) as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We rearrange this to solve for the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Plugging in our value for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n    *   Thus, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.769c$. Rounding to two decimal places gives **0.77c**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Slowly Moving\"**: It is crucial to correctly interpret this phrase to mean that the initial kinetic energy is negligible. This simplifies the initial energy calculation to the sum of the rest energies of the proton-antiproton pair.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum and Symmetry**: The conservation of momentum requires that the total final momentum be zero. This justifies the key simplification that the energy is distributed equally among the four identical product particles.\n3.  **Relativistic Formulas**: Since the calculated velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light ($>0.1c$), using the formulas of special relativity ($E = \\gamma mc^2$ and its derivatives) is mandatory. Classical formulas for energy and momentum would give an incorrect result.\n4.  **Energy Distinction**: A common point of error in these problems is confusing rest energy ($mc^2$) with total relativistic energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$). The annihilation converts the initial rest energy into the final total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the product particles.\n5.  **Analyzing Candidate Answers**: The consensus on the numerical result (0.77c) across all 15 candidate answers provides very high confidence in the calculation. The disagreement on the final letter (A, B, C, or D) confirms that the option ordering was randomized and that the letter choices of the candidates should be ignored.

All four have the same rest mass energy, which is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Energy Distribution:** Due to the conservation of energy, the total final energy of the four particles must equal the total initial energy ($E_{final} = E_{initial}$). Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum was zero) and the symmetry of the final state, this energy must be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n    *   **Energy per Particle ($E_A$):** The total relativistic energy of a single particle A is therefore:\n        $E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity:** The total energy ($E_A$) of each particle A is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy, given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Find the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   **Find the Velocity ($\\beta = v/c$):** The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.

For a symmetric decay into four identical particles, the energy must be distributed equally among them.\n    *   The total relativistic energy for a single particle A is therefore:\n        $E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Velocity ($v$) using Relativistic Formulas**\n    *   The total relativistic energy of particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and we are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined in terms of velocity as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Plugging in the calculated value for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection**\n    *   The calculated velocity is $v \\approx 0.769c$. Rounding to two decimal places gives **0.77c**.\n    *   Comparing this result to the provided options in the question:\n        A) 0.96c\n        B) 0.91c\n        C) 0.77c\n        D) 0.86c\n    *   The calculated value of 0.77c matches option C.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Slowly Moving\":** It is critical to interpret this phrase as \"negligible initial kinetic energy.\" This allows the total initial energy to be calculated simply as the sum of the rest energies.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum and Symmetry:** The conservation of momentum principle is crucial for justifying the equal distribution of energy among the four identical product particles. With zero initial momentum, the final state must be symmetric.\n3.  **Relativistic Formulas:** The kinetic energy of the product particles ($E_A - m_A c^2 \\approx 169$ MeV) is a significant fraction of their rest energy (300 MeV), confirming that the particles are highly relativistic. It is mandatory to use the formulas for relativistic energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) and not classical ones.\n4.  **Energy Types:** One must carefully distinguish between a particle's rest energy ($m_A c^2$) and its total relativistic energy ($E_A$). The velocity is derived from the relationship between these two values.\n5.  **Consistency of Calculation:** The unanimous agreement on the numerical result (~0.77c) across all 15 candidate answers provides very high confidence in the physical reasoning and mathematical execution. The only source of conflict in their final answers was the randomized ordering of the multiple-choice options they were shown.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, it is evident that there is a unanimous agreement on the physical principles and mathematical calculations required to solve this problem. The only inconsistencies arise from the different ordering of the multiple-choice options presented to each agent.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles**: The problem describes a proton-antiproton annihilation. This process must adhere to the fundamental laws of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** as described by the theory of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The system begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The phrase \"slowly moving\" is a standard simplification in physics problems. It signifies that the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy.\n    *   We analyze the interaction in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. With negligible kinetic energy, both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{\\text{initial}}$) is simply the sum of the rest mass energies of the two particles. The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV. An antiproton has an identical rest energy.\n    *   **Calculation**: $E_{\\text{initial}} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State**: The initial energy is entirely converted into four new particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$.\n    *   These four particles have the same given rest mass energy, $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the initial energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is one-quarter of the total initial energy.\n    *   **Calculation**: $E_A = \\frac{E_{\\text{initial}}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$. This is the total relativistic energy (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) of particle A.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity**: The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined in terms of velocity as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   **Calculation**: $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated velocity is $v \\approx 0.769c$. Rounding to two decimal places, this is **0.77c**. Matching this to the provided list of options:\n    A) 0.96c\n    B) 0.77c\n    C) 0.86c\n    D) 0.91c\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Slowly Moving\"**: It is crucial to correctly interpret this standard physics phrase as meaning the initial kinetic energy is negligible. This allows the total initial energy to be set equal to the total rest energy of the proton-antiproton pair.\n2.  **Role of Conservation of Momentum**: This principle is key to justifying the equal distribution of energy among the four identical product particles. With zero initial momentum, the final state must be symmetric to ensure the total final momentum is also zero.\n3.  **Use of Relativistic Formulas**: The problem involves particles with a total energy significantly higher than their rest energy, making them highly relativistic. Using the correct formulas for relativistic energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and velocity from the Lorentz factor is essential.\n4.  **Consistency of Calculation**: The candidate answers unanimously confirm the numerical result. Slight variations in the input value for the proton's mass do not affect the final answer when rounded to two decimal places, demonstrating the robustness of the calculation.\n5.  **Final Option Mapping**: The discrepancies in the candidate answers' final letter choices stem from being given differently ordered lists of options. The core task is to perform the correct physics calculation and map the result to the specific list provided in this problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
