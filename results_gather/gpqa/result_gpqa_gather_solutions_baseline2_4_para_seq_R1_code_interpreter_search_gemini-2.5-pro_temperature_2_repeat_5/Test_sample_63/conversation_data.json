The discrepancy arises from inconsistencies in the provided option lists, not from errors in the scientific reasoning. The core calculation is robust and confirmed by every analysis. Here is a definitive, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Data and Identify Products\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture, with the resulting gases being analyzed sequentially.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a powerful desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it confirms that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is crucial, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds directly to the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   The atomic mass of Oxygen (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen from the salts formed water.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen atoms were distributed between the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N)**: The remaining mass must belong to the element that forms the inert Gas C. The logical candidate is nitrogen. We can verify this by a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**, which confirms that Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. This means that one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must together contain atoms in the same ratio as the total moles we calculated: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio for the combined formula (A+B), we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n    *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n    *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt). This combination has the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be split into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   Salt A: **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Salt B: **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt, as requested by the question.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated value of 17 matches option B in the problem's option list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe task is to solve a chemical analysis problem by determining the composition of two unknown salts (A and B) and then calculating the total number of atoms in their respective formula units. The analysis will proceed in a step-by-step manner.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Experimental Data and Identify Products**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes, each designed to remove a specific component. Analyzing the mass changes allows us to quantify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This limewater solution tests for acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, it confirms that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a critical piece of information, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, and its mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas in the mixture supplied oxygen to the copper. The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The only common element that forms salts and an inert diatomic gas is nitrogen. We can verify this by a mass balance calculation.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Gas C's element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This confirms that Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (Moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we started with an equimolar mixture. This means that for some number of moles `x`, we have `x` moles of Salt A and `x` moles of Salt B. The total elemental composition (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) corresponds to `x` moles of the combined entity (A + B). Therefore, the atomic ratio in one unit of A combined with one unit of B is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo convert this to the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Now we must partition this into two chemically plausible salt formulas.\n\n*   The presence of N, H, and O strongly suggests they are ammonium salts. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (**2 × NH₄⁺**), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**. This implies each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The anions must sum to N₂O₅. The only logical partition into common nitrogen-oxygen anions is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 19\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of this problem is to use the results of a chemical analysis to deduce the identity of two unknown salts, A and B, and then calculate the total number of atoms in their respective formula units. All the candidate answers follow the same correct logical pathway.\n\n### **Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe gaseous mixture from the heating of the salts is analyzed sequentially. We can determine the moles of each component.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This is a desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were formed**. This is a key piece of information, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   The atomic mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of the Final Element (Nitrogen)**: The salts must contain H, O, and at least one other element. We find the remaining mass to identify Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**.\n    *   An inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is overwhelmingly likely to be **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total Moles of Nitrogen atoms (N) = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial sample was an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. This means the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply all values by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The N₂O₅ must be split into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning consistently leads to a total atom count of 17. The candidate answers all agree on this numerical result, although they differ on the final letter choice due to facing differently ordered options. For the options provided in this specific question:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct answer is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer. The provided candidate answers all demonstrate a consistent and correct chemical reasoning, although they differ in their final letter choice due to variations in the options presented to them. The following is a definitive solution based on the problem statement provided.\n\n### Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Analyze Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities**\n\nThe problem involves the thermal decomposition of salts, with the gaseous products analyzed in a sequence of steps. Each step provides a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   **Point 1: Water Production (Tube №1)**\n    *   The tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a drying agent, increased in mass by 3.60 g. This mass is solely due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Point 2: Absence of Acidic Gases (Tube №2)**\n    *   The tube with Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater) did not change in weight. This is critical negative evidence proving that **no acidic gases** like CO₂ or SO₂ were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, oxalate, or sulfite/sulfate anions.\n\n*   **Point 3: Oxygen Atom Transfer (Tube №3)**\n    *   The tube with red-hot copper increased in mass by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is from the oxygen atoms of an oxidizing gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Point 4: Inert Gas Production (Gas C)**\n    *   After the previous reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas (Gas C) remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g sample. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Total Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element in the salts must be the one that formed the inert Gas C. Given the context of salt decomposition, this gas is nitrogen (N₂). We can verify this by a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **N₂**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the original sample was an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The combined chemical formula for one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B must have the elemental mole ratio we just calculated: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, yielding an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   This combined formula, **N₄H₈O₅**, must be partitioned into two plausible salt structures.\n*   Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are a perfect match for two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   We must now partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**. Their sum (NO₃ + NO₂) is N₂O₅.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**: Written as N₂H₄O₂, it has 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**: Written as N₂H₄O₃, it has 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated numerical result is 17. Now we match this to the provided options:\nA) 13\nB) 17\nC) 15\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and a synthesis of the logic presented in the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step resolution to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Step-by-Step Logic**\n\nAll the candidate answers, despite occasional clerical errors in matching the final number to a letter, follow an identical and chemically sound reasoning process. This strong consensus on the methodology provides high confidence in the derived result.\n\n**1. Identification of Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe first step is to analyze the data from each tube to determine the composition of the gaseous decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube is a desiccant, and its mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The unchanged weight of the limewater solution confirms that **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This is a key piece of information, suggesting the salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The final volume of unreacted gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is 2.24 L.\n    *   Molar Volume of Gas at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental makeup of the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identification of the Third Element (Nitrogen):** We can find the remaining mass to identify the element in Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass, along with its chemical inertness in the setup, uniquely identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of the Chemical Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B together must contain atoms in the ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be partitioned into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from the chemical analysis of all candidate answers is that the total number of atoms is 17. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 17\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the problem statement, there is a clear consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the provided answers are not due to errors in chemistry but stem from inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).\n\nThe following is a step-by-step derivation of the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Data and Identify Products**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the results of the sequential gas analysis to determine the quantities of the decomposition products.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it means **no acidic gases were produced**. This is crucial evidence that rules out salts containing carbon or sulfur.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass corresponds to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The 2.24 L of gas that remained after all reactions is chemically inert to the previous reagents. The volume is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the total amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the water produced.\n    *   Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of the Third Element (Nitrogen):** The only logical element for salts containing H and O that forms an inert gas is Nitrogen. We can verify this with a mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms the gas is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total Moles of Nitrogen atoms (N) = 2 × (Moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio of the elements found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n*   To get the simplest whole number ratio, we multiply by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion. The elements present strongly suggest the cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations' atoms from the total formula gives the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be split into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only chemically logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂)**: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃)**: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nAll correct analyses arrive at the number 17. The provided question lists the following options:\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities**\n\nThe problem requires a careful analysis of the gaseous products from the thermal decomposition to determine the composition of the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is crucial evidence that rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy applying the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. We can find the mass of Nitrogen by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of Nitrogen = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   We can verify this with the remaining gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is its mass (2.80 g) divided by its moles (0.10 mol), which is 28.0 g/mol. This confirms that Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms in the mixture = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas (which contains 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. Therefore, the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\nTo find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN:H:O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since A and B are salts, they are composed of cations and anions. Given the elements N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**.\n\n*   The 8 Hydrogen atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt). Two NH₄⁺ ions have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives us the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must have a combined formula of N₂O₅. The most chemically logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (**NH₄NO₂**)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (**NH₄NO₃**)\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", which means the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction based on the results of a chemical analysis. A careful analysis of the candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final numerical result, with discrepancies only arising from the random ordering of the multiple-choice options.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification\n\nThe core of the problem is to use the experimental data to identify the gaseous products of the decomposition and their amounts.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases (e.g., CO₂, SO₂). The fact that its mass did not change is a crucial piece of evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds entirely to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a gas remained after passing through all tubes, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. The elements present can only be hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) in Gas C.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining common element that forms salts with H and O and produces an inert gas is nitrogen. We can confirm this by mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass in original sample = 7.20 g - (0.40 g + 4.00 g) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states the initial sample was an **equimolar** mixture. This means the combined chemical formula for one formula unit of Salt A plus one formula unit of Salt B must have atoms in the same ratio as the moles we found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N:H:O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 H atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by **two** ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must together have the formula N₂O₅. The only chemically logical partition into common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each, added together).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical answer of 17 is derived consistently and correctly by all the candidate solutions. Matching this result with the provided options:\n\nA) 13\nB) 15\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Analysis of the problem-solving process:**\n\nAll candidate answers, despite occasional confusion in matching their final result to the correct lettered option, follow the same sound and logical procedure. The steps are robust and can be verified.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant, and its mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. As its mass did not change, **no acidic gases** were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass corresponds to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture:**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products came from the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must belong to the element that forms the inert Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the third element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is this mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass, along with its inert nature in this context, identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B:**\n\nThe key is that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means that the calculated molar ratio of elements (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the atomic ratio in one formula unit of Salt A combined with one formula unit of Salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply the molar amounts by 20, giving an atomic ratio of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   This combined formula must be partitioned into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain only N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium cations (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), indicating one cation per salt.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the combined formula leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result is consistently derived across all logical analyses. Matching this value with the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 15\nC) 13\nD) 17\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reasoning Process**\nAll candidate answers, despite occasional clerical errors in selecting the final lettered option, follow a unanimous and chemically sound logical procedure. The core of the solution is a multi-step deduction working from the experimental results back to the identity of the original compounds.\n\n**Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\nThis step involves interpreting the results from each analytical tube to determine the moles of each product formed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube is a desiccant, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its mass did not change, it indicates that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is crucial evidence, suggesting the absence of elements like carbon or sulfur in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means the tube reacted with an oxidizing gas, and the mass increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\nBy applying the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identification of the Third Element (Nitrogen):** We can identify the final gas, C, by a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   The remaining mass in the original sample = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**.\n    *   An inert gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms in the original mixture = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. This is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture. This means that the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n*   N:H:O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since A and B are salts composed of N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This means each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives us the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value of 17 is the unanimous numerical result from the correct chemical analysis performed in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\nMatching the calculated value of **17** to the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the problem statement and a synthesis of the reasoning provided in the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify Products\n\nThe core of the problem is to deduce the identity of the original salts by analyzing the products of their thermal decomposition. This is done by interpreting the results from each step of the gas analysis.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper. The oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas.\n    *   The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining gas (2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure - STP) is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now determine the total amount of each element in that sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only logical identity for the inert gas (Gas C) is Nitrogen (N₂). We can confirm this by mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of Nitrogen = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This confirms Gas C is N₂, as its molar mass would be 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. (This is also consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas, which contains 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\n### 3. Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B\n\nThe initial sample was an equimolar mixture. This means that the total molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = (0.20×20) : (0.40×20) : (0.25×20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (**NH₄NO₂**)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (**NH₄NO₃**)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### 5. Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17. Matching this value with the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the problem requires a meticulous step-by-step breakdown of the experimental data to deduce the identities of the initial salts and then answer the question. All the candidate answers, despite occasional confusion with the multiple-choice lettering, converge on the same chemical reasoning and numerical result.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\n\nThe core of the problem is to use the sequential absorption data to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Point 1: Identify the role of each chemical trap.**\n    *   Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂) is a powerful desiccant. The mass gain of 3.60 g is the mass of **water (H₂O)** produced.\n    *   Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution) is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which is a crucial piece of **negative evidence**: no acidic gases were formed.\n    *   Tube №3 (red-hot copper) is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass gain of 0.80 g is from **oxygen atoms (O)** that formed copper oxide (CuO).\n\n*   **Point 2: Calculate the molar quantities of the products.**\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   Moles of O atoms transferred to copper = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   Moles of remaining gas C (at STP) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Point 3: Calculate the moles of each element in the initial mixture.**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water. Moles H = 2 × Moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the water AND the gas that reacted with copper. Moles O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts contain N, H, and O. The mass of Nitrogen can be found by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass N = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n        *   We can confirm the identity of Gas C (0.10 mol) with this mass. Its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol, which confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. This is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Point 4: Use the \"equimolar\" condition.** The problem states the initial mixture of A and B was equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply by 20, giving **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   **Point 5: Deduce the chemical formulas.** We need to partition N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n    *   Given the elements, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n    *   Subtracting the cations from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n    *   The only logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Point 6: Answer the exact question asked.** The question is for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂, which is N₂H₄O₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃, which is N₂H₄O₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result of 17 corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a comprehensive review of the problem and the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities\nThe core of the problem is to deduce the identity of the original salts by analyzing their decomposition products. The experimental setup allows for a sequential identification and quantification of these products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant), so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, a common test for acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbon, such as carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in that original mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. The remaining inert gas (Gas C) must be Nitrogen (N₂). We can verify this by a mass balance check:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass (must be Nitrogen) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is its mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is indeed **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture**. Therefore, the molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the ratio in one formula unit of Salt A combined with one formula unit of Salt B.\n\n*   To get a simple whole-number ratio for the combined formula, we multiply the moles by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must partition this into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must together have the formula N₂O₅. The most common and logical partition into two stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical answer is consistently derived by all correct methods presented in the candidate answers. Comparing this result with the provided options:\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate solutions.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Products from Experimental Data:** The core of the problem is to accurately quantify the products from the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This is a drying agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This tube tests for acidic gases. Since its mass did not change, it's a critical point that **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, which means the mass increase is purely from the oxygen atoms captured by the copper.\n        *   Atomic mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C)**: After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of Initial Salts:** Using the law of conservation of mass, we can find the composition of the original 7.20 g mixture. The elements present must be Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the water.\n        *   Total moles H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Total moles O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Total Nitrogen (N)**: We can identify the remaining inert Gas C by its mass.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Remaining Mass = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   This 2.80 g mass belongs to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. The only common, stable, inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is Nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** The key is that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means that one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must together contain atoms in the same ratio as the moles we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25).\n    *   To get a simple whole number ratio, multiply by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n    *   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Since these are salts, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 H atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), meaning each salt contains one NH₄⁺.\n    *   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**. The experimental data is fully consistent with the decomposition products of this mixture.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:** The calculated value is 17.

All the provided candidate answers correctly follow the same logical path, although they may have been working with differently ordered options, leading to discrepancies in the final letter choice. The chemical reasoning itself is sound and consistent across all analyses.\n\nHere is a synthesized, step-by-step solution:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products**\n\nThe gaseous products from the thermal decomposition of the salt mixture are analyzed sequentially.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a powerful drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it confirms that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a key piece of information, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds entirely to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The final volume of gas that did not react with any of the previous tubes is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in that original mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O produced.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts contain H, O, and a third element that forms an inert gas. This element must be nitrogen. We can verify this with a mass balance calculation.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Remaining mass (must be Nitrogen) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C can now be calculated: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This confirms that the inert Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol** (which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas).\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the initial mixture was equimolar and contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. Therefore, the combined formula of one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must have an atomic ratio of N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To simplify this to a whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   This is the combined formula for (A + B). Since they are salts containing only N, H, and O, the cation is very likely the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This implies that each salt (A and B) contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be partitioned into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only chemically logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated value of 17 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct and unanimous chemical reasoning presented in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nThe problem requires deducing the identity of two salts from the results of their thermal decomposition. A careful, quantitative analysis of each step is crucial.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced is analyzed in a sequence of chemical traps. We can calculate the molar quantities of each product identified.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which is a crucial piece of evidence: **no acidic gases were formed**. This effectively rules out salts containing carbon (e.g., carbonates, oxalates) or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is solely from oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining gas (2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure - STP) is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   Molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element in the salts must be the one that formed the inert Gas C. Based on the elements (H, O) and the fact they are salts, this is overwhelmingly likely to be nitrogen. We confirm this with a mass balance:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This is a critical clue. It means the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must now partition this into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain only N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only chemically logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B,\" which implies the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**: Can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**: Can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis final number, 17, is the unanimous result of a correct chemical analysis. Matching this result to the specific options provided in the question:\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The discrepancy arises from inconsistencies in the provided option lists, not from errors in the scientific reasoning. The core calculation is robust and confirmed by every analysis. Here is a definitive, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Data and Identify Products\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture, with the resulting gases being analyzed sequentially.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a powerful desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it confirms that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is crucial, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds directly to the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   The atomic mass of Oxygen (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen from the salts formed water.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen atoms were distributed between the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N)**: The remaining mass must belong to the element that forms the inert Gas C. The logical candidate is nitrogen. We can verify this by a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g mass corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**, which confirms that Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. This means that one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must together contain atoms in the same ratio as the total moles we calculated: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio for the combined formula (A+B), we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n    *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n    *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt). This combination has the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be split into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   Salt A: **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Salt B: **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt, as requested by the question.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated value of 17 matches option B in the problem's option list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe task is to solve a chemical analysis problem by determining the composition of two unknown salts (A and B) and then calculating the total number of atoms in their respective formula units. The analysis will proceed in a step-by-step manner.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Experimental Data and Identify Products**\n\nThe gaseous mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes, each designed to remove a specific component. Analyzing the mass changes allows us to quantify the products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This limewater solution tests for acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, it confirms that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a critical piece of information, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, and its mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas in the mixture supplied oxygen to the copper. The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The only common element that forms salts and an inert diatomic gas is nitrogen. We can verify this by a mass balance calculation.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass for Gas C's element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This confirms that Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (Moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we started with an equimolar mixture. This means that for some number of moles `x`, we have `x` moles of Salt A and `x` moles of Salt B. The total elemental composition (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) corresponds to `x` moles of the combined entity (A + B). Therefore, the atomic ratio in one unit of A combined with one unit of B is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo convert this to the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Now we must partition this into two chemically plausible salt formulas.\n\n*   The presence of N, H, and O strongly suggests they are ammonium salts. The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (**2 × NH₄⁺**), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**. This implies each salt contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the composition of the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The anions must sum to N₂O₅. The only logical partition into common nitrogen-oxygen anions is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂ or N₂H₄O₂):**\n    2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃ or N₂H₄O₃):**\n    2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 19\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of this problem is to use the results of a chemical analysis to deduce the identity of two unknown salts, A and B, and then calculate the total number of atoms in their respective formula units. All the candidate answers follow the same correct logical pathway.\n\n### **Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe gaseous mixture from the heating of the salts is analyzed sequentially. We can determine the moles of each component.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This is a desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, we can conclude that **no acidic gases were formed**. This is a key piece of information, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper.\n    *   The atomic mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas)**: After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of the Final Element (Nitrogen)**: The salts must contain H, O, and at least one other element. We find the remaining mass to identify Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**.\n    *   An inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is overwhelmingly likely to be **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total Moles of Nitrogen atoms (N) = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial sample was an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. This means the molar ratio of the elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply all values by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The N₂O₅ must be split into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning consistently leads to a total atom count of 17. The candidate answers all agree on this numerical result, although they differ on the final letter choice due to facing differently ordered options. For the options provided in this specific question:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct answer is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer. The provided candidate answers all demonstrate a consistent and correct chemical reasoning, although they differ in their final letter choice due to variations in the options presented to them. The following is a definitive solution based on the problem statement provided.\n\n### Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Analyze Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities**\n\nThe problem involves the thermal decomposition of salts, with the gaseous products analyzed in a sequence of steps. Each step provides a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   **Point 1: Water Production (Tube №1)**\n    *   The tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a drying agent, increased in mass by 3.60 g. This mass is solely due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Point 2: Absence of Acidic Gases (Tube №2)**\n    *   The tube with Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater) did not change in weight. This is critical negative evidence proving that **no acidic gases** like CO₂ or SO₂ were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, oxalate, or sulfite/sulfate anions.\n\n*   **Point 3: Oxygen Atom Transfer (Tube №3)**\n    *   The tube with red-hot copper increased in mass by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass gain is from the oxygen atoms of an oxidizing gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Point 4: Inert Gas Production (Gas C)**\n    *   After the previous reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas (Gas C) remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g sample. We can now calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Total Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining element in the salts must be the one that formed the inert Gas C. Given the context of salt decomposition, this gas is nitrogen (N₂). We can verify this by a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **N₂**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the original sample was an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The combined chemical formula for one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B must have the elemental mole ratio we just calculated: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, yielding an atomic ratio of **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n*   This combined formula, **N₄H₈O₅**, must be partitioned into two plausible salt structures.\n*   Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 hydrogen atoms are a perfect match for two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   We must now partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**. Their sum (NO₃ + NO₂) is N₂O₅.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in their individual chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂)**: Written as N₂H₄O₂, it has 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃)**: Written as N₂H₄O₃, it has 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated numerical result is 17. Now we match this to the provided options:\nA) 13\nB) 17\nC) 15\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and a synthesis of the logic presented in the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step resolution to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Step-by-Step Logic**\n\nAll the candidate answers, despite occasional clerical errors in matching the final number to a letter, follow an identical and chemically sound reasoning process. This strong consensus on the methodology provides high confidence in the derived result.\n\n**1. Identification of Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe first step is to analyze the data from each tube to determine the composition of the gaseous decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube is a desiccant, and its mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The unchanged weight of the limewater solution confirms that **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This is a key piece of information, suggesting the salts do not contain elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The final volume of unreacted gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is 2.24 L.\n    *   Molar Volume of Gas at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the elemental makeup of the initial 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identification of the Third Element (Nitrogen):** We can find the remaining mass to identify the element in Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is therefore 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass, along with its chemical inertness in the setup, uniquely identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identification of the Chemical Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B together must contain atoms in the ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the most common cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be partitioned into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only logical combination is the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from the chemical analysis of all candidate answers is that the total number of atoms is 17. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 17\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the problem statement, there is a clear consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the provided answers are not due to errors in chemistry but stem from inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).\n\nThe following is a step-by-step derivation of the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Data and Identify Products**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the results of the sequential gas analysis to determine the quantities of the decomposition products.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube is a desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it means **no acidic gases were produced**. This is crucial evidence that rules out salts containing carbon or sulfur.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass corresponds to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The 2.24 L of gas that remained after all reactions is chemically inert to the previous reagents. The volume is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, we can determine the total amount of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture of salts.\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the water produced.\n    *   Moles H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O from Cu reaction) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of the Third Element (Nitrogen):** The only logical element for salts containing H and O that forms an inert gas is Nitrogen. We can verify this with a mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the remaining element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g corresponds to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol. This confirms the gas is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total Moles of Nitrogen atoms (N) = 2 × (Moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture was equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio of the elements found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n*   To get the simplest whole number ratio, we multiply by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n*   The combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion. The elements present strongly suggest the cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting the cations' atoms from the total formula gives the atoms for the anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be split into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only chemically logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each of the identified salts.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂)**: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃)**: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nAll correct analyses arrive at the number 17. The provided question lists the following options:\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities**\n\nThe problem requires a careful analysis of the gaseous products from the thermal decomposition to determine the composition of the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is crucial evidence that rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy applying the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. We can find the mass of Nitrogen by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of Nitrogen = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   We can verify this with the remaining gas C. The molar mass of Gas C is its mass (2.80 g) divided by its moles (0.10 mol), which is 28.0 g/mol. This confirms that Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms in the mixture = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas (which contains 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial sample was an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. Therefore, the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\nTo find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN:H:O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since A and B are salts, they are composed of cations and anions. Given the elements N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**.\n\n*   The 8 Hydrogen atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt). Two NH₄⁺ ions have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives us the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must have a combined formula of N₂O₅. The most chemically logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (**NH₄NO₂**)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (**NH₄NO₃**)\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the \"total number of all atoms in salts A and B\", which means the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\nThe calculated value of 17 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction based on the results of a chemical analysis. A careful analysis of the candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final numerical result, with discrepancies only arising from the random ordering of the multiple-choice options.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification\n\nThe core of the problem is to use the experimental data to identify the gaseous products of the decomposition and their amounts.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases (e.g., CO₂, SO₂). The fact that its mass did not change is a crucial piece of evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds entirely to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a gas remained after passing through all tubes, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. The elements present can only be hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) in Gas C.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles in H₂O) + (moles reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Identity and Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only remaining common element that forms salts with H and O and produces an inert gas is nitrogen. We can confirm this by mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass in original sample = 7.20 g - (0.40 g + 4.00 g) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of inert Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states the initial sample was an **equimolar** mixture. This means the combined chemical formula for one formula unit of Salt A plus one formula unit of Salt B must have atoms in the same ratio as the moles we found: N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N:H:O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**. The 8 H atoms in the combined formula are perfectly accounted for by **two** ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must together have the formula N₂O₅. The only chemically logical partition into common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)** and the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each, added together).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical answer of 17 is derived consistently and correctly by all the candidate solutions. Matching this result with the provided options:\n\nA) 13\nB) 15\nC) 17\nD) 19\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Analysis of the problem-solving process:**\n\nAll candidate answers, despite occasional confusion in matching their final result to the correct lettered option, follow the same sound and logical procedure. The steps are robust and can be verified.\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant, and its mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. As its mass did not change, **no acidic gases** were produced. This rules out salts containing carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass corresponds to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture:**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products came from the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the water and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must belong to the element that forms the inert Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of the third element = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is this mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass, along with its inert nature in this context, identifies Gas C as **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B:**\n\nThe key is that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means that the calculated molar ratio of elements (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) corresponds to the atomic ratio in one formula unit of Salt A combined with one formula unit of Salt B.\n\n*   To find the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply the molar amounts by 20, giving an atomic ratio of **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   This combined formula must be partitioned into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain only N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium cations (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), indicating one cation per salt.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the combined formula leaves the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The most logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result is consistently derived across all logical analyses. Matching this value with the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 15\nC) 13\nD) 17\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reasoning Process**\nAll candidate answers, despite occasional clerical errors in selecting the final lettered option, follow a unanimous and chemically sound logical procedure. The core of the solution is a multi-step deduction working from the experimental results back to the identity of the original compounds.\n\n**Step 1: Quantify the Decomposition Products**\nThis step involves interpreting the results from each analytical tube to determine the moles of each product formed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube is a desiccant, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its mass did not change, it indicates that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is crucial evidence, suggesting the absence of elements like carbon or sulfur in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This means the tube reacted with an oxidizing gas, and the mass increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen atoms (O) that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\nBy applying the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the original sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n*   **Identification of the Third Element (Nitrogen):** We can identify the final gas, C, by a mass balance check.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   The remaining mass in the original sample = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This 2.80 g is the mass of the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Therefore, the molar mass of Gas C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**.\n    *   An inert gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms in the original mixture = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. This is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B**\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture. This means that the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n*   N:H:O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since A and B are salts composed of N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This means each salt, A and B, contains one ammonium cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives us the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This requires summing the atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis value of 17 is the unanimous numerical result from the correct chemical analysis performed in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\nMatching the calculated value of **17** to the provided options:\nA) 19\nB) 13\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the problem statement and a synthesis of the reasoning provided in the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify Products\n\nThe core of the problem is to deduce the identity of the original salts by analyzing the products of their thermal decomposition. This is done by interpreting the results from each step of the gas analysis.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The tube's mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper. The oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas.\n    *   The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining gas (2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure - STP) is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture\n\nUsing the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now determine the total amount of each element in that sample.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms are found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (Moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles O in H₂O) + (Moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The only logical identity for the inert gas (Gas C) is Nitrogen (N₂). We can confirm this by mass balance.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of Nitrogen = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   This confirms Gas C is N₂, as its molar mass would be 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. (This is also consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas, which contains 0.20 mol of N atoms).\n\n### 3. Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B\n\nThe initial sample was an equimolar mixture. This means that the total molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the atomic ratio in one formula unit of A combined with one formula unit of B.\n\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = (0.20×20) : (0.40×20) : (0.25×20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   Since A and B are salts made of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt), which have a combined formula of **N₂H₈**.\n*   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (**NH₄NO₂**)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (**NH₄NO₃**)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### 5.

All the candidate answers, despite occasional confusion with the multiple-choice lettering, converge on the same chemical reasoning and numerical result.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**1. Analysis of Experimental Data and Product Identification**\n\nThe core of the problem is to use the sequential absorption data to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Point 1: Identify the role of each chemical trap.**\n    *   Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂) is a powerful desiccant. The mass gain of 3.60 g is the mass of **water (H₂O)** produced.\n    *   Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution) is limewater, which detects acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which is a crucial piece of **negative evidence**: no acidic gases were formed.\n    *   Tube №3 (red-hot copper) is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass gain of 0.80 g is from **oxygen atoms (O)** that formed copper oxide (CuO).\n\n*   **Point 2: Calculate the molar quantities of the products.**\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   Moles of O atoms transferred to copper = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   Moles of remaining gas C (at STP) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the Law of Conservation of Mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Point 3: Calculate the moles of each element in the initial mixture.**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the water. Moles H = 2 × Moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the water AND the gas that reacted with copper. Moles O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O from tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts contain N, H, and O. The mass of Nitrogen can be found by subtracting the mass of H and O from the total.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass N = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = 2.80 g.\n        *   We can confirm the identity of Gas C (0.10 mol) with this mass. Its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol, which confirms Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**. This is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Point 4: Use the \"equimolar\" condition.** The problem states the initial mixture of A and B was equimolar. Therefore, the combined formula of one unit of A plus one unit of B must have an atomic ratio identical to the molar ratio we calculated: N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n    *   To get a simple integer ratio, we multiply by 20, giving **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   **Point 5: Deduce the chemical formulas.** We need to partition N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n    *   Given the elements, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (one for each salt): 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n    *   Subtracting the cations from the total formula (N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈) leaves **N₂O₅** for the two anions.\n    *   The only logical partition of N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Point 6: Answer the exact question asked.** The question is for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂, which is N₂H₄O₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃, which is N₂H₄O₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical result of 17 corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a comprehensive review of the problem and the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities\nThe core of the problem is to deduce the identity of the original salts by analyzing their decomposition products. The experimental setup allows for a sequential identification and quantification of these products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent (desiccant), so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, a common test for acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of negative evidence: **no acidic gases were produced**. This rules out salts containing carbon, such as carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in that original mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is found in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. The remaining inert gas (Gas C) must be Nitrogen (N₂). We can verify this by a mass balance check:\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Remaining mass (must be Nitrogen) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C is its mass divided by its moles: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This molar mass confirms Gas C is indeed **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**, which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture**. Therefore, the molar ratio of elements we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25) represents the ratio in one formula unit of Salt A combined with one formula unit of Salt B.\n\n*   To get a simple whole-number ratio for the combined formula, we multiply the moles by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = (0.20 × 20) : (0.40 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = **4 : 8 : 5**.\n*   The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We must partition this into two plausible salt structures. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), implying each salt has one NH₄⁺ cation.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   The two anions must together have the formula N₂O₅. The most common and logical partition into two stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms =** (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis numerical answer is consistently derived by all correct methods presented in the candidate answers. Comparing this result with the provided options:\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate solutions.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Products from Experimental Data:** The core of the problem is to accurately quantify the products from the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This is a drying agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This tube tests for acidic gases. Since its mass did not change, it's a critical point that **no acidic gases** (like CO₂) were produced. This rules out salts containing elements like carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, which means the mass increase is purely from the oxygen atoms captured by the copper.\n        *   Atomic mass of an Oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C)**: After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of Initial Salts:** Using the law of conservation of mass, we can find the composition of the original 7.20 g mixture. The elements present must be Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H)**: All hydrogen is found in the water.\n        *   Total moles H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O)**: Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Total moles O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n    *   **Total Nitrogen (N)**: We can identify the remaining inert Gas C by its mass.\n        *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Remaining Mass = 7.20 g (total) - 0.40 g (H) - 4.00 g (O) = **2.80 g**.\n        *   This 2.80 g mass belongs to the 0.10 mol of Gas C. Its molar mass is 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. The only common, stable, inert gas from salt decomposition with this molar mass is Nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:** The key is that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means that one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must together contain atoms in the same ratio as the moles we found (N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25).\n    *   To get a simple whole number ratio, multiply by 20: N:H:O = **4:8:5**.\n    *   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   Since these are salts, the cation is almost certainly the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The 8 H atoms are perfectly accounted for by two ammonium ions (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈), meaning each salt contains one NH₄⁺.\n    *   Subtracting the cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n    *   The only logical way to partition N₂O₅ into two common, stable nitrogen-oxygen anions is into **nitrite (NO₂⁻)** and **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**. The experimental data is fully consistent with the decomposition products of this mixture.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:** The calculated value is 17. Matching this with the provided options:\n    A) 15\n    B) 17\n    C) 19\n    D) 13\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a complex stoichiometry problem that requires a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the experimental data. All the provided candidate answers correctly follow the same logical path, although they may have been working with differently ordered options, leading to discrepancies in the final letter choice. The chemical reasoning itself is sound and consistent across all analyses.\n\nHere is a synthesized, step-by-step solution:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products**\n\nThe gaseous products from the thermal decomposition of the salt mixture are analyzed sequentially.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a powerful drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, it confirms that **no acidic gases were produced**. This is a key piece of information, ruling out salts containing elements like carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds entirely to the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The final volume of gas that did not react with any of the previous tubes is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture. We can now calculate the total moles of each element in that original mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O produced.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both the water and the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The salts contain H, O, and a third element that forms an inert gas. This element must be nitrogen. We can verify this with a mass balance calculation.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Remaining mass (must be Nitrogen) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = **2.80 g**\n    *   The molar mass of Gas C can now be calculated: 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = **28.0 g/mol**. This confirms that the inert Gas C is **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol** (which is consistent with 0.10 mol of N₂ gas).\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the initial mixture was equimolar and contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. Therefore, the combined formula of one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B must have an atomic ratio of N:H:O = 0.20:0.40:0.25.\n\n*   To simplify this to a whole-number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20: **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   This is the combined formula for (A + B). Since they are salts containing only N, H, and O, the cation is very likely the **ammonium ion (NH₄⁺)**.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms are perfectly accounted for by **two ammonium ions** (2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈). This implies that each salt (A and B) contains one ammonium ion.\n*   Subtracting the atoms of the two cations from the total formula gives the atoms for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ − N₂H₈ = **N₂O₅**.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be partitioned into two common nitrogen-oxygen anions. The only chemically logical combination is the **nitrite ion (NO₂⁻)** and the **nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)**.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are:\n    *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    Formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃. Total atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis calculated value of 17 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
