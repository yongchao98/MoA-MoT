    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by performing the necessary astrophysical calculations and logical deductions.
    
    The steps are:
    1. Calculate the cosmological redshift (z) from the given distance.
    2. Calculate the rest-frame energy (E_rest) of the absorption line.
    3. Identify the spectral line by comparing E_rest to known astrophysical transitions.
    4. Use the problem's constraint ("absorption line") to determine the state of the medium.
    5. Compare the derived correct answer with the provided answer.
