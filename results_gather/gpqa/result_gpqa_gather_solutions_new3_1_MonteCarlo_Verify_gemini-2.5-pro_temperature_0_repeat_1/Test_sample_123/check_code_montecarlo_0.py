    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the particle physics problem.

    The problem involves calculating a new Lorentz factor (gamma) for a desired
    particle survival fraction, based on an initial set of conditions.

    The relationship derived from the physics is:
    gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(f_1) / ln(f_2)
    where f is the survival fraction.
    This can be simplified to:
    gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) / ln(1/f_2)
