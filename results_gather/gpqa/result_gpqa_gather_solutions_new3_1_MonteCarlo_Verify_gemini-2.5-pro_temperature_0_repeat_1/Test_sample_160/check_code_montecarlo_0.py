    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by modeling the physics of the problem.

    The core of the problem is to compare two mean free paths (MFP):
    1.  λ1: MFP for gas molecule-gas molecule collisions.
    2.  λ2: MFP for high-energy electron-gas molecule collisions.

    The analysis relies on two key physical principles.

    # The final answer from the LLM to be checked.
    llm_answer = "C"

    # --- Principle 1: Formulas for Mean Free Path (MFP) ---
    # The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is number density and σ is cross-section.
    # For λ1 (gas-gas), kinetic theory includes a √2 factor for relative motion of all particles.
    #   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)
    # For λ2 (electron-gas), the electron is so fast the gas molecules are stationary targets. The √2 factor is absent.
    #   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    # Taking the ratio of λ2 to λ1 gives:
    #   λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg

    # --- Principle 2: Comparing Collision Cross-Sections (σ) ---
    # This is the most critical step. For a very high-energy (1000 kV) electron, the particle is highly
    # penetrating and the target atom appears as mostly empty space. A significant scattering event is rare.
    # Therefore, the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is significantly SMALLER than the
    # kinetic cross-section for two molecules colliding (σ_gg).
    # This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number significantly greater than 1.
    
    # --- Derivation of the Correct Relationship ---
    # From the ratio λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg):
    # Since √2 ≈ 1.414 and (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1, we can definitively conclude that:
    # λ2 / λ1 > √2
    # Therefore, λ2 > 1.414 * λ1

    # --- Evaluating the Options based on the Derived Relationship ---
    # We must find the option that is consistent with λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.
    
    # Option A: λ2 < λ1
    # This is false.
    
    # Option B: λ2 = λ1
    # This is false.
    
    # Option C: λ2 >= 1.22*λ1
    # This is TRUE. If a value is greater than 1.414, it is also greater than or equal to 1.22.
    
    # Option D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1
    # This is false, as our derived relationship shows λ2 is greater than 1.22*λ1.
