    # Step 1: Verify the structure of the final product (Product 4).
    # The reaction sequence is:
    # 1. Acetic acid -> Bromoacetic acid (alpha-bromination)
    # 2. Bromoacetic acid -> Ethyl bromoacetate (Fischer esterification)
    # 3. Ethyl bromoacetate -> Ethyl cyanoacetate (SN2 with cyanide)
    # 4. Ethyl cyanoacetate + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Intramolecular cyclization

    # The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -CN and a -COOCH2CH3 group on C1.
    # The four groups on C1 are -CN, -COOEt, and the two paths around the ring.
    # Since the two paths around the ring are identical (C1-C2-C3... vs C1-C6-C5...), C1 is NOT a chiral center.
