    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the chemistry problem.

    The problem is to find the concentration of Ca2+ ions from a 0.02 M solution
    of Ca-EDTA complex, given the formation constant Kf = 5x10^10.

    The equilibrium is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <==> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-
    The dissociation constant Kd = 1 / Kf.
    The equilibrium expression is: Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]
    Let x = [Ca^2+]. Then [EDTA^4-] = x and [[Ca-EDTA]^2-] = 0.02 - x.
    So, Kd = x^2 / (0.02 - x).

    The code will verify the LLM's answer by plugging its value of x into this
    equation and checking if the resulting Kd matches the theoretical Kd.
