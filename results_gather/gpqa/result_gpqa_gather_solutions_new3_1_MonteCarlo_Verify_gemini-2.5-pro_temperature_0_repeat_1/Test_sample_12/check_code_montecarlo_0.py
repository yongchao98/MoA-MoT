    # exocyclic double bond, leaving the C4 stereocenter unaffected.

    # Rule: m-CPBA attacks the double bond from the face 'anti' (opposite) to the bulky
    # C4-(R) isopropyl group to minimize steric hindrance.
    # This stereoselective attack determines the configuration of the new C1 and C2 centers.

    # sterically hindered carbon (C2) via an S_N2 mechanism.
    # S_N2 attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center.
    state['name'] = 'alcohol intermediate'

    # at all stereocenters.
