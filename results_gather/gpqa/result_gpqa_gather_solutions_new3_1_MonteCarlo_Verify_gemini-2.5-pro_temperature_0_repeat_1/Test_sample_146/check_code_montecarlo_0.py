    # --- Calculation from First Principles ---

    # 1. Calculate the total initial energy (E_initial).
    # Since the proton and antiproton are at rest (or "slowly moving"),
    # the initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.
    # E_initial = m_p*c^2 + m_p_bar*c^2 = 2 * m_p*c^2
    E_initial = 2 * m_p_c2

    # 2. Set up the final energy equation (E_final).
    # The final state has 4 particles of mass m_A, each moving with the same
    # speed v and Lorentz factor gamma.
    # E_final = 4 * (gamma * m_A*c^2)

    # 3. Apply conservation of energy (E_initial = E_final) and solve for gamma.
    # 2 * m_p*c^2 = 4 * gamma * m_A*c^2
    # gamma = (2 * m_p*c^2) / (4 * m_A*c^2) = m_p*c^2 / (2 * m_A*c^2)
