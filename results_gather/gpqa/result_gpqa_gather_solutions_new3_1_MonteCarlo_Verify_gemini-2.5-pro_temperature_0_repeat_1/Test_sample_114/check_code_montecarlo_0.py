    # --- Calculation using Physical Principles ---
    # We use natural units where the rest mass m=1 and the speed of light c=1.
    # This simplifies the relativistic formulas without loss of generality.

    # 1. Conservation of Energy
    # The total initial energy is the sum of the individual particle energies.
    # E_particle = gamma * m * c^2  =>  E_particle = gamma (in natural units)
    E_initial = gamma_e + gamma_p

    # The initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy (E_photon).
    # E_initial = 2 * E_photon
    E_photon = E_initial / 2

    # 2. Conservation of Momentum
    # The initial momentum is the vector sum of the particle momenta.
    # p_particle = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1) * m * c => p_particle = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)
    p_electron = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1)
    p_positron = math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)
    
    # The net initial momentum is along the x-axis.
    p_initial_x = p_electron - p_positron

    # For a photon, momentum p = E/c. In our units, p_photon = E_photon.
    p_photon = E_photon

    # The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the photons' x-components.
    # To conserve momentum in the y-direction, the photons must be emitted at
    # symmetric angles +theta and -theta to the x-axis.
    # p_final_x = p_photon*cos(theta) + p_photon*cos(theta) = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)
    # By conservation, p_initial_x = p_final_x.
    # So, cos(theta) = p_initial_x / (2 * p_photon)
    cos_theta = p_initial_x / (2 * p_photon)

    # 3. Solve for the Angle
    # The angle of one photon with the axis is theta.
    theta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)
    
    # The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2*theta.
    calculated_angle_deg = 2 * math.degrees(theta_rad)

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated angle is close to the LLM's answer.
    # A tolerance of 0.5 degrees is reasonable for this type of problem.
