    # Step 1: Diene Generation. The assumption that the unusual starting material is a precursor to o-xylylene is a common and necessary simplification for such problems.
    # Step 2 & 3: Deprotection & Oxidation. Acidic cleavage of a t-butyl ether and Parikh-Doering oxidation are standard, plausible reactions.
    # Step 4: Fragmentation & Rearrangement. The double retro-Diels-Alder is the expected thermal reaction. The subsequent fragmentation of the norbornadienone core to benzene and the tautomerization of the reactive o-xylylene to the stable aromatic o-xylene are chemically sound and well-established principles.
