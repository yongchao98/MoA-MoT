    Checks the correctness of the answer by following the logical deductions from the problem statement.

    The core logic is:
    1. Identify substance Z based on its properties.
    2. Identify the components of mixture Y based on Z and the reaction type.
    3. Apply the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction X -> Y to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in X.
    4. Compare this calculated value with the given answer.
