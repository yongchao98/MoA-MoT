Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on the provided candidate answers and chemical principles.

### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**

The question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism. The key principle for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).

1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**
    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds.
    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds (they are sp² hybridized).
    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These carbons do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on a saturated (sp³) carbon that are required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (gain of H₂), not an isomeric interconversion (tautomerism), as the molecular formula changes.
    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.

2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**
    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.
    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups.
    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These carbons possess hydrogens that are highly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.
    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable due to its aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.

**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**

The question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism. This requires the molecule to be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**
    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
    *   **Analysis:** The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:
        1.  -H (hydrogen)
        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)
        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)
        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)
    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will** show optical isomerism.

2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**
    *   **Structure:** CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer).
    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups.
    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.

**Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### **Final Conclusion**

*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.
*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

Matching this conclusion with the given options:
A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate
B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate
D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

The correct option is D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning was often correct, several agents made an error in matching their correct reasoning to the final lettered option. The analysis consistently supports option D.
