def check_smeft_symmetry_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer regarding required symmetries in SMEFT.

    The function encodes the fundamental principles of SMEFT construction:
    1.  SMEFT is a local, relativistic quantum field theory, so it must be Poincare invariant.
        Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations.
    2.  The CPT theorem states that a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT must be CPT invariant.
    3.  The Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, and SMEFT is designed to parameterize
        potential new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP is not a required symmetry.
