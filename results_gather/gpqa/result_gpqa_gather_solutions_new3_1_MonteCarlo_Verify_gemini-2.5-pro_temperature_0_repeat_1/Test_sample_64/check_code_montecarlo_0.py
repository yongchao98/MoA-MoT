    # Reaction 1: Anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol.
    # The reaction involves deprotonation (KH), a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift that opens the
    # strained 4-membered ring, and tautomerization upon acidic workup (H+).
    # This is known to form a bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane skeleton.
