    # The resulting structure is (MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOMe.
    # The correct IUPAC name is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.
    correct_A = "trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate"

    # Reaction B: Stork enamine synthesis. The enamine attacks the beta-carbon of the nitrile,
    # followed by hydrolysis to the ketone. The major product is the more stable keto tautomer.
    # The correct name is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.
    correct_B = "3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile"

    # Reaction C: Retrosynthesis. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

    # Therefore, the Michael donor (C) must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
