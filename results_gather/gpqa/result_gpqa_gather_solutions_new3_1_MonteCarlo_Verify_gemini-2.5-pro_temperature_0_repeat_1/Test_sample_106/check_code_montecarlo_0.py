    # B) Combine with in vitro assays: This is a validation step. It's powerful but often impractical
    #    as a prerequisite because it requires having the physical compounds, which the in silico
    #    screen is meant to help prioritize for synthesis. So, A precedes B.
    # C) Use the most stable form: This is a flawed assumption. The biologically active form is
    #    often not the most stable one in isolation.
    # D) Focus on ADME: This is a later stage in drug discovery (pharmacokinetics), performed after
    #    binding affinity (pharmacodynamics) is established.
