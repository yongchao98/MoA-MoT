def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the textile dye question.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from its energy.
    2. Identify the color of the emitted light.
    3. Apply the Stokes Shift principle: absorbed wavelength must be shorter than emitted wavelength.
    4. Filter the options based on this principle.
    5. Apply a plausibility check (smallest Stokes Shift) to find the most likely answer.
    6. Compare the result with the provided answer ('B' for Blue).
