def check_cope_rearrangement_product():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the aza-Cope rearrangement product.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Determine the structure of the kinetic product from the aza-Cope mechanism.
       This is done by analyzing the bond shifts and resulting connectivity. The product
       is characterized by the positions of its two double bonds on the resulting
       cyclopenta[c]pyridine skeleton.
    2. Determine the structure of each multiple-choice option by interpreting its IUPAC name.
       This also results in a characterization based on double bond positions.
    3. Compare the structure of the kinetic product with the structure of the chosen answer (D).
       If they match, and no other options match, the answer is correct.
