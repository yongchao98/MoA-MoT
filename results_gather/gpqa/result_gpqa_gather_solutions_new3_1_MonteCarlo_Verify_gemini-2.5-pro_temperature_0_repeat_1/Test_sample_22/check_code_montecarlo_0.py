    This function checks the correctness of the answer to a chemistry problem involving
    the reaction of ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with HBr.

    It does so by:
    1. Defining the expected products based on the established reaction mechanism.
    2. Comparing these expected products with the products listed in the chosen answer option.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Define Expected Products from the Reaction Mechanism ---

    # The reaction is an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization.
    # Reactant: Ph-O-CH2-C(Me)2-CH=CH2
    # Reagent: HBr (strong acid)

    # Initial Step: Protonation of the alkene via Markovnikov's rule forms a secondary carbocation.
    # Intermediate 1: Ph-O-CH2-C(Me)2-CH(+)-CH3

    # This intermediate can follow two competing pathways:

    # Pathway A: Direct Intramolecular Cyclization (6-endo-trig)
    # The ortho-position of the benzene ring attacks the secondary carbocation.
    # This forms a 6-membered ring (a chromane).
    # Product 1: "3,3,4-trimethylchromane"
    product_from_pathway_A = "3,3,4-trimethylchromane"

    # Pathway B: Rearrangement then Cyclization (5-exo-trig)
    # Intermediate 1 undergoes a 1,2-methyl shift to form a more stable tertiary carbocation.
    # Intermediate 2: Ph-O-CH2-C(+)(Me)-CH(CH3)2
    # The ortho-position of the benzene ring attacks this tertiary carbocation.
    # This forms a 5-membered ring (a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran).
    # Product 2: "3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran"
    product_from_pathway_B = "3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran"
