To determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:

**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
*   **Careful Point**: This molecule does not have a traditional chiral carbon. We must consider other sources of chirality, such as axial chirality.
*   **Analysis**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. At all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), there are bulky substituents: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). These large groups sterically hinder each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image.
*   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
*   **Careful Point**: We should check for the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.
*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:
    1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)
    2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)
    3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)
    4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)
    Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center.
*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

**3. benzophenone**
*   **Careful Point**: We must check for elements of symmetry.
*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups, so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.
*   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**4. dimethyl fumarate**
*   **Careful Point**: This is a geometric isomer (*trans*), but we need to assess it for chirality, not geometric isomerism. We must check for symmetry.
*   **Analysis**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The molecule is planar. This molecular plane is an element of symmetry. Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.
*   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Final Decision**
Based on the analysis, only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and will show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option B.
