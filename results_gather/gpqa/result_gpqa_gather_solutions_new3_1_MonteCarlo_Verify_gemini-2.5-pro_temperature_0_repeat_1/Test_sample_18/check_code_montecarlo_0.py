def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given chemistry question.

    The function evaluates two key chemical principles:
    1.  Reaction A: The regioselectivity of the Michael addition. The most acidic proton
        on the Michael donor (methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate) is at the C1 position,
        between the two carbonyl groups. Therefore, the new C-C bond must form at C1.
    2.  Reaction B: The structural outcome of the Michael addition. The reaction between
        the two esters results in a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound. A "succinate" derivative,
        which is a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound, is the product of a different reaction
        (like a Stobbe condensation) and is incorrect here.

    The function checks if the chosen answer's product names are consistent with these principles.
