    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the energy of a
    Lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c.

    It follows the most plausible calculation method identified in the problem analysis:
    1. Calculates the Lorentz factor for v = 0.96c.
    2. Approximates the nucleus's rest energy as (Mass Number * Neutron Rest Energy).
    3. Calculates the total relativistic energy E = gamma * E_rest.
    4. Compares the result to the given answer (20.132 GeV) and checks if the
       difference is within the specified precision of 1e-4.
