    # --- Define Key Principles and Data from the Question ---

    # 1. The central event is Cre-Lox recombination to create a fusion protein.
    # 2. The recombination leaves a 'lox' site scar.
    lox_site_length = 34  # Standard length of a loxP or lox2272 site in base pairs.

    # 3. The genetic code is read in codons of 3 base pairs.
    codon_length = 3

    # 4. The key observation from the experiment.
    observation = "no green signal"

    # 5. Information about other components.
    promoter_type = "CBA"  # A strong, ubiquitous promoter.
    preliminary_test_result = "protein expression confirmed" # Western blot showed signal.

    # --- Evaluate the Options ---

    # Option A: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.
    # Evaluation: This would cause a mislocalized signal, not a complete absence of signal.
    # The observation "no green signal" contradicts this.
    is_option_A_correct = False
    reason_A = "Incorrect. Golgi retention would result in a mislocalized green signal, but the observation is a complete *absence* of signal."

    # Option B: Ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship.
    # Evaluation: This describes a biological function, not a technical reason for expression failure.
    is_option_B_correct = False
    reason_B = "Incorrect. The biological relationship between the proteins is irrelevant to the technical failure of the reporter gene's expression within a cell."

    # Option C: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.
    # Evaluation: Check if the lox site scar causes a frameshift.
    causes_frameshift = (lox_site_length % codon_length) != 0
    # A frameshift prevents correct protein synthesis, leading to no signal. This matches the observation.
    is_option_C_correct = causes_frameshift
    reason_C = f"Correct. The residual {lox_site_length} bp lox site is not divisible by {codon_length}, causing a frameshift mutation. This prevents the correct synthesis of the eGFP protein, leading to no signal, which matches the observation."

    # Option D: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.
    # Evaluation: This is contradicted by the use of a strong CBA promoter and the positive Western blot.
    is_option_D_correct = False
    reason_D = "Incorrect. The construct uses a strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter, and the preliminary Western blot confirmed protein expression, making a missing enhancer highly unlikely."

    # --- Final Check ---
