Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct statement.

**1. Deconstruct the Core Problem**
The goal is to create polyethylene with "regular branches" using only ethylene as the starting material. This requires a tandem catalysis process:
*   **Catalyst 1 (Oligomerization):** This is the "essential additional reaction step." It must selectively convert ethylene into a specific short alpha-olefin (e.g., trimerize ethylene into 1-hexene). The selectivity is crucial for creating "regular" branches of a consistent length.
*   **Catalyst 2 (Polymerization):** This catalyst copolymerizes the remaining ethylene with the in-situ generated alpha-olefin to form the final branched polymer (Linear Low-Density Polyethylene, or LLDPE).

**2. Analyze Each Statement**

*   **A) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**
    *   The "essential additional reaction step" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene.
    *   The most successful catalysts for this reaction (e.g., chromium-based systems) almost universally require an activator or co-catalyst.
    *   The most common and essential activators are organoaluminum compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified MAO (MMAO), and various trialkylaluminums.
    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is factually incorrect. Aluminum-based activators are crucial for this reaction.

*   **B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**
    *   Group VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table contains Chromium (Cr).
    *   Chromium-based catalysts are the state-of-the-art industrial technology for the *selective* oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene (trimerization) and 1-octene (tetramerization).
    *   This is precisely the function required to generate the comonomers for "regular branches." These catalysts indeed require "specific activators" (like MAO) to function.
    *   **Conclusion:** This statement is a fundamental and accurate description of the key chemical technology required. It is correct.

*   **C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**
    *   Catalysts based on noble metals like palladium (Pd) can produce branched polyethylene from ethylene via a "chain-walking" mechanism.
    *   However, this mechanism typically creates a variety of branch types and lengths (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl), resulting in a hyperbranched structure, not the "regular branches" of uniform length implied by the question.
    *   Therefore, while the statement is true in a general sense (noble metal catalysts exist and are expensive), it is incorrect in the specific context of producing *regular* branches.

*   **D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**
    *   This statement is ambiguous. The core technology (selective oligomerization of ethylene) is certainly implemented on an industrial scale in the US (e.g., by Chevron Phillips and Sasol). However, this is often done in dedicated plants to produce alpha-olefins as a separate product.
    *   A true "combined system" in a single reactor, where both oligomerization and polymerization occur simultaneously, is a more advanced concept. While such technologies are developed and licensed (e.g., by Univation, Dow, Chevron Phillips), their widespread implementation as single-reactor tandem systems is less common than dual-reactor systems or the separate production of comonomers.
    *   Because of the ambiguity of "combined systems," this statement is less definitively and universally correct than statement B.

**3. Final Decision**
Statement A is incorrect in context. Statement C is factually incorrect. Statement D is ambiguous and its correctness depends on a strict interpretation of "combined systems." Statement B is a direct, unambiguous, and fundamentally correct statement about the specific chemistry that enables the desired transformation. It describes the cornerstone of the most successful industrial and research approaches to this problem.

Therefore, statement B is the single best answer.
