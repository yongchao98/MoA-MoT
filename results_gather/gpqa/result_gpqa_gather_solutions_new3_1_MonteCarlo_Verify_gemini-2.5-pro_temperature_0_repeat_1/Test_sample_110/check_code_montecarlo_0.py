    # --- Analysis of Reaction A ---
    # Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A
    # This is a Michael Addition reaction.
    #
    # 1. Enolate Formation: The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone.
    #    - The alpha-carbon at C2 is quaternary and has no protons.
    #    - The alpha-carbon at C6 is tertiary and has one proton.
    #    - Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6, forming the enolate between C1 and C6.
    #
    # 2. Nucleophilic Attack: The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.
    #
    # 3. Product Naming: The product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent
    #    on the C3 of the propanoate chain. To name the substituent ring, numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6).
    #    - New C1 (old C6): has a methyl group.
    #    - New C2 (old C1): has the oxo group.
    #    - New C3 (old C2): has an ethyl group and a methyl group.
    #    This results in the substituent name: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).
    correct_product_A_name = "ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate"

    # --- Analysis of Reaction B ---
    # Reaction: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) ---> B
    # This is also a Michael Addition (specifically, a nitro-Michael reaction).
    #
    # 1. Carbanion Formation: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane.
    #
    # 2. Nucleophilic Attack: The resulting carbanion attacks the beta-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.
    #    The resulting structure is: CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN
    #
    # 3. Product Naming: The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.
    #    - The longest carbon chain containing C1 has 6 carbons, so the parent name is hexanenitrile.
    #    - Numbering from the nitrile: CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)
    #    - The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.
