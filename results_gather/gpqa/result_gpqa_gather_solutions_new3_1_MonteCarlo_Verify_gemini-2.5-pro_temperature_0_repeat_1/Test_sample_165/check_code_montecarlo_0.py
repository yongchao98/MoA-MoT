Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Understand the Core Physics Principle

The question asks for the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson (PGB) generated by radiative corrections. This is a standard calculation in quantum field theory, governed by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The key formula for the one-loop mass-squared of such a particle is:

$M_{PGB}^2 = \frac{1}{C \cdot f^2} \text{Str}[\mathcal{M}^4]$

Let's break this down:
*   **Prefactor:** The mass-squared is inversely proportional to the square of the symmetry-breaking scale, $f^2$. In this problem, the scale is given by the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) $v$ and $x$, so $f^2 = (x^2+v^2)$. The term $C$ is a numerical factor from the loop integral, typically involving $8\pi^2$ or $16\pi^2$.
*   **Supertrace (Str):** The supertrace sums over the fourth power of the masses of all particles that couple to the scalar sector. The sign of each contribution depends on the particle's spin due to the spin-statistics theorem:
    *   **Bosons** (spin 0 scalars, spin 1 vectors) contribute with a **positive** sign.
    *   **Fermions** (spin 1/2) contribute with a **negative** sign.

### Step 2: Identify the Contributing Particles

We need to list all the massive particles in the model that will contribute to the loop calculation.
*   **Bosons (Positive Contribution):**
    *   Gauge Bosons: $W, Z$
    *   Scalars: The model has a Standard Model Higgs doublet, a new scalar doublet $S$, and a singlet $\phi$. This leads to a rich spectrum of physical scalars. The options list the other physical scalars as $h_1$ (another CP-even scalar), $H^\pm$ (charged scalars), $H^0$ (a third CP-even scalar), and $A^0$ (a CP-odd scalar). A complete formula should include all of them.
*   **Fermions (Negative Contribution):**
    *   Standard Model: The heaviest fermion is the top quark, $t$. Its contribution is crucial and cannot be ignored.
    *   New Particles: The heavy singlet neutrinos, $N_i$.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Options Based on These Principles

Let's check each option against our derived structure:
$M_{h_2}^2 = \frac{1}{8\pi^2(x^2+v^2)} \left\{ (\text{Boson terms}) - (\text{Fermion terms}) \right\}$

*   **Option A:** $M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\frac{1}{8\pi^{2}\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\right)}\left\{ \dots -\alpha_{4}M_{t}^{4} \dots -\alpha_{7}\sum M_{N_{i}}^{4}\right\}$
    *   This option is missing the contribution from the CP-odd scalar, $A^0$. In a general model of this type (2-Higgs-Doublet-Model + Singlet), a physical $A^0$ exists and should contribute. The formula is therefore incomplete.

*   **Option B:** $M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\frac{\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\right)}{8\pi^{2}}\left\{ \dots \right\}$
    *   This option has the factor $(x^2+v^2)$ in the numerator. This is dimensionally incorrect. A mass-squared ($[M]^2$) cannot be proportional to a VEV-squared ($[M]^2$) times a mass-to-the-fourth ($[M]^4$). This option is fundamentally wrong.

*   **Option C:** $M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\frac{1}{8\pi^{2}\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\right)}\left\{ \dots -\alpha_{7}\sum M_{N_{i}}^{4}\right\}$
    *   This option is missing the contribution from the top quark (the $-M_t^4$ term). The top quark is the heaviest Standard Model particle, and its contribution to radiative corrections in the Higgs sector is very significant. Omitting it is a major physical error.

*   **Option D:** $M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\frac{1}{8\pi^{2}\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\right)}\left\{ \alpha_{1}M_{h_{1}}^{4}+\alpha_{2}M_{W}^{4}+\alpha_{3}M_{Z}^{4}-\alpha_{4}M_{t}^{4}+\alpha_{5}M_{H^{\pm}}^{4}+\alpha_{6}M_{H^{0}}^{4}+\alpha_{7}M_{A^{0}}^{4}-\alpha_{8}\sum M_{N_{i}}^{4}\right\}$
    *   **Prefactor:** Correct. It is proportional to $1/(x^2+v^2)$.
    *   **Signs:** All boson terms ($h_1, W, Z, H^\pm, H^0, A^0$) have a positive sign (as the $\alpha_i$ are positive constants). All fermion terms ($t, N_i$) have a negative sign. This is correct.
    *   **Completeness:** It includes all the particles we expect to contribute from the Standard Model and the new physics sector. This is the most complete and physically sound formula among the choices.

### Conclusion

Option D is the only one that satisfies all the requirements of a one-loop radiative mass calculation for a pseudo-Goldstone boson in this model: it has the correct dimensional structure, the correct signs for boson and fermion contributions, and includes all the relevant particles.
