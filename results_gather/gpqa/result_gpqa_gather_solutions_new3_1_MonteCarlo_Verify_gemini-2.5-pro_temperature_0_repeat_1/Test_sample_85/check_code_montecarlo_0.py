    # not at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.
    # An (R) starting material will yield an (R) product.
    # An (S) starting material will yield an (S) product.

                f"1. For Reaction A (using LiBH4), the product is (R). Since the reaction retains stereochemistry, starting material A must be (R).\n"
