def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the quantum mechanics problem.

    The core principle is the normalization of the wave function:
    ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1 over the allowed region [1, 3].

    1.  The probability density is |ψ(x)|² = (Re)² + (Im)².
        ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i
        Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)
        Im(ψ) = -0.5
        |ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25

    2.  The normalization integral is ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1.

    3.  Solving the integral analytically:
        [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3
        = (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)
        = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5
        = a² * ln(2) + 0.5

    4.  Setting the result to 1 and solving for 'a':
        a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
        a² * ln(2) = 0.5
        a² = 0.5 / ln(2)
        a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))
