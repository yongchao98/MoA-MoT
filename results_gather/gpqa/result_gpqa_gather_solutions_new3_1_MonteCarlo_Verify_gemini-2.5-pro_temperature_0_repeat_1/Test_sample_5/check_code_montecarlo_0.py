    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the energy spectrum of a 2D quantum system.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines all necessary symbolic variables.
    2. Converts the potential from polar to Cartesian coordinates.
    3. Derives the angular frequencies (omega_x, omega_y) for the resulting 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.
    4. Calculates the total energy spectrum E by summing the energies of the two independent 1D oscillators.
    5. Compares the derived energy spectrum with the expression from the chosen answer (Option D).
