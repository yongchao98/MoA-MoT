    # --- Step 1: Deduce the molecular structure and predict its 1H NMR spectrum ---
    
    # From the question:
    # - Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene ring, C6H4)
    # - 8 carbon atoms total -> Substituents have 8 - 6 = 2 carbons.
    # - Carbonyl group (C=O) and aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) present.
    #
    # Deduction:
    # - One substituent is a halogen (-X), which has 0 carbons.
    # - The other substituent must have 2 carbons and a C=O group.
    # - This leads to an acetyl group (-COCH3).
    # - The structure is a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).
    #
    # NMR Prediction for the most likely isomer (para-haloacetophenone):
    # 1. Acetyl group (-COCH3): A singlet (s) for 3 protons (3H), typically around 2.0-2.7 ppm.
    # 2. Aromatic protons (-C6H4-): A para-substituted ring gives a characteristic pattern of
    #    two doublets (d), each for 2 protons (2H), in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).
    # 3. Total protons = 3 (acetyl) + 4 (aromatic) = 7.

    # --- Step 2: Define a function to check if an NMR spectrum matches the prediction ---
