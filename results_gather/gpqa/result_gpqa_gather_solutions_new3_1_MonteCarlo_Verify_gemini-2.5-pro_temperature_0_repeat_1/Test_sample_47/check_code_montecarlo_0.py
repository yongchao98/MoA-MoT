    This problem requires a step-by-step deduction of a four-step organic synthesis, followed by a structural analysis of the final product to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

    **Step-by-Step Synthesis Analysis:**

    1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.
        *   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.

    2.  **Product 1 + NaOH (heat) → Product 2:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base, known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.
        *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.

    3.  **Product 2 + SOCl₂/pyridine → Product 3:** This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride using thionyl chloride.
        *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.

    4.  **Product 3 + LiAlH(OtBu)₃ → Product 4:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.
        *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

    **Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**

    The final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals that would appear in its ¹H NMR spectrum.

    1.  **Structure:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).
    2.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon of the ring (the point of attachment), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.
    3.  **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**
        *   **Type 1:** The single aldehyde proton (-C**H**O) is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)
        *   **Type 2:** The single proton on C1 (the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group) is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)
        *   **Type 3 & 4:** The carbons at positions C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**—they are not chemically equivalent because one is "cis" and the other is "trans" relative to the aldehyde group. The two "cis" protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two "trans" protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct sets of protons from these four hydrogens. (2 types)
        *   **Type 5 & 6:** Similarly, the carbons at positions C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of protons, which are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their greater distance from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. (2 types)

    **Total Count:**
    Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.

    The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6. This corresponds to option D.
