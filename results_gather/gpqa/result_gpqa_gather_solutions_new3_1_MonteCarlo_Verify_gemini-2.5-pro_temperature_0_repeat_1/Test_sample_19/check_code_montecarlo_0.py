Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.

**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept of the "Impulse Approximation"**

The "impulse approximation" is a model used in nuclear physics to simplify the calculation of a high-energy probe (like an electron or neutrino) interacting with a nucleus. The central idea is to treat the complex interaction with the entire nucleus as a sum of simpler interactions with individual nucleons. For this approximation to be valid, the interaction must happen so quickly (like an "impulse") that the struck nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, momentarily isolated from the rest of the nucleus.

**Step 2: Analyze Each Proposed Assumption**

Let's evaluate each statement to see if it's a necessary component of this "free nucleon" picture.

*   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the most fundamental part of the approximation. It breaks the complex many-body problem down into a set of one-body problems. It assumes the probe hits one nucleon at a time, ignoring more complex scenarios where the probe might interact with the force-carrying particles between nucleons (meson-exchange currents) or with a correlated pair of nucleons.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is a core assumption.

*   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**
    *   **Analysis:** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. It means that the incoming probe reaches the target nucleon without scattering off other nucleons first, and that the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) leave the nucleus without any further interactions. These secondary collisions are called "final-state interactions" (FSI). To treat the nucleon as truly free throughout the process, one must neglect FSI.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is a core assumption for the simplest and most common form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation).

*   **3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement is about the internal structure of the nucleon itself (its constituent quarks). The impulse approximation, however, operates at the level of nucleons within a nucleus. It is a model of *nuclear dynamics*, not *nucleon structure*. The internal physics of the nucleon, including whether its quarks are relativistic, is a separate topic. In fact, the impulse approximation is frequently used in relativistic contexts.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is not an assumption of the impulse approximation. It is an incorrect distractor.

*   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the essence of the "impulse" concept. It assumes the interaction is so rapid that the forces binding the nucleon to the nucleus are negligible *during the brief moment of collision*. The energy transferred is assumed to be much greater than the nucleon's binding energy. This allows the interaction itself to be calculated as if the nucleon were free.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is a core assumption.

**Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Select the Correct Option**

Based on the analysis, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.
*   Assumption 1 sets up the one-on-one interaction.
*   Assumption 4 ensures the nucleon is "free" *during* the interaction.
*   Assumption 2 ensures the nucleon is "free" from the influence of other nucleons *before and after* the interaction.
*   Assumption 3 is irrelevant to this level of approximation.

The combination of assumptions 1, 2, and 4 corresponds to option D.

A careful review of the candidate answers shows that while their reasoning overwhelmingly supports the combination (1, 2, 4), many of them have a mismatch between their reasoning and the final letter they output. The physical reasoning is sound and consistently points to the same conclusion.
