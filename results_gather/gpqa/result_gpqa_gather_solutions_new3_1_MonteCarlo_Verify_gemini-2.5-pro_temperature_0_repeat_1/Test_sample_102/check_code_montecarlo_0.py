    # This is a complex but valid synthetic route. Let's trace it.
    # Step i: Benzene -> Acetophenone. (-COCH3 is a meta-director). Correct.
    # Step ii: Acetophenone -> 3-Bromoacetophenone. (-COCH3 directs Br to meta position). Correct.
    # Step iii: Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone. Ring has a m-director (-COCH3) and an o,p-director (-Br).
    #          The o,p-director is more influential, leading to nitration at C4 (para to Br).
    #          Product: 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone. This is a valid intermediate.
    # Step iv: Reduction of the nitro group. Product: 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone. Correct.
    # Step v: Nitration. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) at C4 directs the new nitro group
    #          to its ortho position (C5), as C3 is blocked. This is highly regioselective.
    #          Product: 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone. Correct.
    # Step vi: Diazotization of the amino group at C4. Correct.
    # Step vii: Deamination (removal of the diazonium group with H3PO2).
    #           Final Product: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Correct.
