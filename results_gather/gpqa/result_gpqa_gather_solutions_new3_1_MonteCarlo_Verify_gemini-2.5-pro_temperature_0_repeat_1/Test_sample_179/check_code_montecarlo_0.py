def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the proposed answer for the minimum energy of the charge system.

    The function calculates the total potential energy from first principles:
    1.  It uses high-precision values for physical constants (Coulomb's constant k, elementary charge e).
    2.  It calculates the dimensionless energy constant (E_12) for the icosahedral arrangement
        of the 12 shell charges using a precise geometric formula.
    3.  It sums the energy from the central charge's interaction with the 12 shell charges
        and the energy from the interactions among the 12 shell charges themselves.
    4.  It compares the calculated result to the value from the proposed answer (Option A).
