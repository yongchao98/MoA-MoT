    This function checks the correctness of the answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.

    1.  Symbolically re-derives the solution from the principle of energy conservation.
    2.  Compares the derived solution to the given options.
    3.  Checks the physical constraints (dimensional consistency, v_max < c, classical limit) for all options.

    # This makes Option C dimensionally inconsistent and therefore incorrect.
    
    # Constraint 2: Physical Plausibility (v_max < c)
    # For Option A, if k*A^2/(2*m*c^2) is a small positive number, the denominator (1 - small_num) is < 1,
    # making its reciprocal > 1. The term inside the sqrt becomes > 2, leading to v_max > c.
    # Thus, Option A is physically impossible.
    
    # For Option B, let x = k*A**2/(2*m*c**2) > 0. The term (1+x)^2 > 1, so 0 < 1/(1+x)^2 < 1.
    # The term inside the sqrt is 1 - (a number between 0 and 1), which is also between 0 and 1.
