    # Step 1: Check the proposed structure for Product 1
    # The answer deduces Product 1 is 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one.
    # This resolves a contradiction in the problem statement:
    # - The ozonolysis in step 3 REQUIRES a C=C double bond.
    # - The Â¹H NMR integration (14H) suggests a saturated formula (C10H14O).
    # - The proposed structure (C10H12O) has a C=C bond and fits the key NMR shift (4.79 ppm for =CH2) and IR (ketone).
    # This is a sound problem-solving approach, prioritizing reaction chemistry over a likely data typo.
