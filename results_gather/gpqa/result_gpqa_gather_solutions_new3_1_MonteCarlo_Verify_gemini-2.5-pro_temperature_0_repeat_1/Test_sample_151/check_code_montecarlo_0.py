Based on a step-by-step analysis of the provided candidate answers and the biological principles involved, here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1.  **Deconstruct the Biological Scenario:**
    *   **Organism:** Yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*).
    *   **Response:** Formation of a "shmoo" due to a peptide mimicking a mating pheromone.
    *   **Key Cellular State:** The mating pheromone response causes yeast to arrest its cell cycle in the **G1 phase**. This is a critical point. The cell halts its preparation for mitotic division and instead redirects its resources to a new developmental program: preparing for mating. This involves a massive change in gene expression.

2.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Method:**
    *   **Technique:** Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by Mass Spectrometry (ChIP-MS).
    *   **Target:** The proteome (the set of all proteins) of **active chromatin**.
    *   **Interpretation:** Active chromatin (euchromatin) is defined by its accessibility and its association with the machinery for **gene transcription**. Therefore, the experiment is designed to isolate and identify proteins that are bound to DNA regions where genes are being actively read.

3.  **Evaluate Each Protein Complex in this Context:**

    *   **A) pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This complex, including RNA polymerase, assembles at gene promoters to begin transcription. Since the shmoo response requires the active transcription of hundreds of mating-specific genes, the PIC is a central component of the active chromatin in this state. It would be **highly abundant**.

    *   **B) nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of all chromatin, active or inactive. DNA is wrapped around these histone protein cores. Any experiment that isolates chromatin will recover a very large amount of histones, making this complex **highly abundant**.

    *   **C) enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA sequences that bind specific transcription factors to dramatically increase the transcription of target genes. The highly regulated gene expression program for mating is dependent on these complexes. They are a hallmark of active chromatin and would be **highly abundant**.

    *   **D) pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** This complex assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase. Its function is to "license" the DNA, preparing it for replication in the subsequent S phase. Here lies the crucial distinction:
        *   The cell is arrested in G1, so pre-RCs are indeed assembled on the chromatin.
        *   However, the cell is actively **prevented** from entering S phase. The function for which the pre-RC is assembled—DNA replication—is inhibited.
        *   The experiment is targeting the proteome of *transcriptionally active* chromatin. The pre-RC's function is related to replication, not transcription.

### Conclusion and Careful Points

*   The primary activity of the cell is a massive transcriptional program for mating. Complexes directly involved in this (PIC and enhancer complexes) will be abundant.
*   The basic structural component of all chromatin (nucleosomes) will be ubiquitous and abundant.
*   The process of DNA replication is actively inhibited. While the machinery to license replication (the pre-RC) is present on the DNA at specific sites (origins of replication), its function is stalled, and it is not part of the active transcriptional machinery that defines the cell's current state.
*   Therefore, when comparing the protein complexes involved in the highly active process of transcription versus the inhibited process of replication, the **pre-replication complex** will be the least observed in an assay targeting the proteome of active chromatin.
