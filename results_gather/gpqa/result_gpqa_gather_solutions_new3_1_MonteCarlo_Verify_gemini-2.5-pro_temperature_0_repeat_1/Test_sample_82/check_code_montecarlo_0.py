    # --- Step 1: Dilution Calculation ---
    # Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution
    initial_moles_acid = (initial_acid_vol_cm3 / 1000.0) * initial_acid_conc_M
    
    # Calculate the volume of the acid solution after dilution

    # Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid

    # --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---
    # At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer.
    # We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])
    pKa = -math.log10(Ka)
    
    # At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.

    # --- Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point ---
    # At the equivalence point, moles of base added = initial moles of acid.
    # Calculate the volume of NaOH added to reach the equivalence point.

    total_vol_equiv_L = diluted_acid_vol_L + vol_base_added_L
    
    # At the equivalence point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base (acetate, A-).
    # The moles of acetate are equal to the initial moles of acid.
    # Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion.
    conc_A_minus_equiv = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_equiv_L
    
    # The acetate ion hydrolyzes, making the solution basic.
    # A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-
    # We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.
    Kb = Kw / Ka
    
    # Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] using the approximation:
    # Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] â‰ˆ [OH-]^2 / [A-]
    conc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_equiv)
    
    # Calculate pOH and then pH.
    pOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)
    calculated_ph_equiv = 14.0 - pOH

    # --- Step 4: Verification ---
