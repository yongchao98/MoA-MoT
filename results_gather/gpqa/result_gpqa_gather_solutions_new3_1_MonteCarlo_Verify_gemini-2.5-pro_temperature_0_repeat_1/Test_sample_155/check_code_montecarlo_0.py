Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including careful points to consider.

**Step 1: Analyze the Overall Chemical Transformation**

The question describes a two-step reaction sequence:
1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is an epoxidation reaction, which is a **syn-addition** of an oxygen atom across the double bond.
2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen, resulting in an **anti-addition** relative to the epoxide ring.

The combination of a *syn*-epoxidation followed by an *anti*-ring-opening results in an overall **anti-dihydroxylation** of the starting alkene.

**Step 2: Determine the Product of Reaction 1**

*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene.
*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.
*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound.
*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.

**Step 3: Determine the Product of Reaction 2**

*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene.
*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.
*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.
*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**

The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol
2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol
3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol

The relationship between these isomers is crucial:
*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.
*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.

**Step 5: Predict the Chromatographic Results**

*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.
    *   **Enantiomers** (compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will have the same retention time and elute together as a single, unresolved peak.
    *   **Diastereomers** (compound 1 vs. the pair of 2 and 3) have different physical properties. They will have different retention times and will be separated.
    *   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.

*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.
    *   In a chiral environment, **enantiomers** (compounds 2 and 3) interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into two distinct peaks.
    *   The **meso compound** (compound 1) is also chemically distinct from the other two isomers and will be separated, appearing as its own peak.
    *   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.

**Final Summary:**
*   Standard HPLC: **2 peaks**
*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**

This result matches option C.

**Careful Points:**
*   **Reaction Stereochemistry:** It is essential to correctly identify the overall reaction as an *anti*-dihydroxylation and apply the correct stereochemical rules (Trans + Anti → Meso; Cis + Anti → Racemic).
*   **Isomer Relationships:** Correctly identifying the products as one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers is key. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers.
*   **Chromatography Principles:** One must know that standard (achiral) HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers, while chiral HPLC separates both.
*   **Matching to Options:** After a correct analysis, it is important to carefully read the options and select the one that matches the conclusion (2 peaks in standard, 3 in chiral). Several candidate answers performed the analysis correctly but failed at this final step.
