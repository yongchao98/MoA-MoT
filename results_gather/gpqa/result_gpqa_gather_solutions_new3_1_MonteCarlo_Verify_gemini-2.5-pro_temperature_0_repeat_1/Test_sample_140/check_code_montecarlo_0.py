    # The base can abstract a hydrogen from C6 or a deuterium from C2.

    # Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6
    # This is kinetically favored.
    # Intermediate: 3-deuterobenzyne (triple bond between C1 and C6).
    # The deuterium at C2 is retained.
    # We simulate the addition to this intermediate.
    
    # Attack at C1 of 3-deuterobenzyne:
    # - NH2 group adds to C1.
    # - Carbanion at C6 is protonated.
    # - Result: NH2 at C1, D at C2. This is 2-deuteroaniline.

    # - NH2 group adds to C6.
    # - Carbanion at C1 is protonated.
    # - Result: NH2 at C6, D at C2. Renumbering from the NH2 group, D is at C3.
    # - This is 3-deuteroaniline.
    final_products.add("3-deuteroaniline")

    # Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2
    # This is kinetically disfavored but still possible.
    # Intermediate: Benzyne (non-deuterated, triple bond between C1 and C2).
    # The deuterium is removed from the molecule.
    # We simulate the addition to this intermediate.

    # Attack at C1 or C2 of benzyne:
    # - Since the intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium,
    #   attack at either carbon followed by protonation yields the same product.
    # - Result: Aniline (non-deuterated).
