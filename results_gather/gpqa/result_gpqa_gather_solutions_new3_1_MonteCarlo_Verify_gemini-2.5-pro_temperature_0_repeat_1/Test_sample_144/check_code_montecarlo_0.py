Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

**1. Deconstruct the IUPAC Name and Draw the Structure**

The name of the compound is **6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol**.
*   **Parent Chain**: `undeca` -> 11-carbon chain.
*   **Unsaturation**: `-3,7-dien-` -> Two double bonds, one starting at C3 (between C3-C4) and one at C7 (between C7-C8).
*   **Principal Functional Group**: `-5-ol` -> A hydroxyl (-OH) group on C5.
*   **Substituents**: `6-chloro` (Cl on C6), `9-ethyl` (-CH₂CH₃ on C9), `2-methyl` (-CH₃ on C2).

The correct structure is:
