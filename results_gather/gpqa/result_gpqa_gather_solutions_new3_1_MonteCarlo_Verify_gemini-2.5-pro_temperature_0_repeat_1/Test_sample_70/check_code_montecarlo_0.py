    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.
    The key relationships are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis (a): T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).
    2. Kepler's Third Law: The square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: P^2 ∝ a^3, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).

    Combining these gives the relationship between temperature and period:
    T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).

    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is:
    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).
