    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by verifying the observability of each star.
    A star is observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES if it meets two criteria:
    1. Visibility: Its declination is within the range visible from both observatories.
    2. Brightness: Its apparent V magnitude is brighter than the stricter limit of the two instruments.
