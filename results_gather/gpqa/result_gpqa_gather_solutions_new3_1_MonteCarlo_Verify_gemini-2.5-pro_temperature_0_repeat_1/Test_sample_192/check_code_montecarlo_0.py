    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

    The core of this problem lies in correctly interpreting the given information and applying the correct mathematical transformation. There are two possible interpretations of the phrase "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵", which leads to the two different answers seen in the candidate responses (`r³` vs. `r⁴`).

    **Step 1: Interpret the Given Information**

    *   **The statement:** "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵".
    *   **Careful Point 1 (The Ambiguity):** This could mean:
        1.  **Cumulative Count:** The total number of stars `N` with a parallax greater than `plx` is proportional to `1/plx⁵`. This is equivalent to the total number of stars within a certain distance `r`.
        2.  **Differential Count (Number Density):** The number of stars *per unit interval of parallax*, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx⁵`.
    *   **Resolution:** In physics and astronomy, when describing how a population of objects is distributed as a function of a continuous variable (like mass, luminosity, or parallax), the statement typically refers to the differential count or number density. The cumulative count is usually specified explicitly (e.g., "the number of stars brighter than..."). Therefore, the most standard and physically sound interpretation is the second one: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`.

    **Step 2: Define the Goal**

    The question asks "How does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?". This is explicitly asking for the differential count with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.

    **Step 3: Relate the Quantities**

    We need to convert a number density in terms of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, to a number density in terms of distance, `dN/dr`.

    *   **Careful Point 2 (The Transformation):** The number of stars `dN` in a small segment of the sky is the same regardless of how we measure it. Therefore, the number in a small parallax range `d(plx)` must equal the number in the corresponding distance range `dr`.
        `dN = (dN/d(plx)) d(plx) = (dN/dr) dr`
        Rearranging this gives the formula for transforming densities:
        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`
        We use the absolute value because number densities cannot be negative.

    **Step 4: Use the Fundamental Parallax-Distance Relationship**

    The relationship between parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) is inverse:
    `plx ∝ 1/r`

    **Step 5: Execute the Calculation**

    1.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**
        If `plx = k/r` (where k is a constant), then `d(plx)/dr = -k/r²`.
        The absolute value is `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r²`.

    2.  **Substitute into the transformation formula:**
        `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`
        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`

    3.  **Careful Point 3 (Express in terms of `r` only):** The final answer must be a function of `r`. We substitute `plx ∝ 1/r` into the expression:
        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`

    4.  **Simplify:**
        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`
        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`
        `dN/dr ∝ r³`

    **Conclusion**

    Based on the standard interpretation of the problem statement, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r³`. This corresponds to option A.
