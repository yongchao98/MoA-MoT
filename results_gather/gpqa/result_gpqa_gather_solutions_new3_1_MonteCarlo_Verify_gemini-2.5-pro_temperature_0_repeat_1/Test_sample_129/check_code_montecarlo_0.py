def check_correctness_of_redshift_limit():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the Lyman-alpha redshift question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Define the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Å).
    2. Define the atmospheric cutoff wavelength, which is the minimum wavelength
       observable from the ground. A standard, practical value is ~3500 Å.
    3. For each option, calculate the observed wavelength.
    4. The correct answer must be the SMALLEST redshift option that results in an
       observed wavelength greater than or equal to the atmospheric cutoff.
