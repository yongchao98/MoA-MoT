Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

**1. Identify the Goal**
The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is a direct request for the ratio of their total masses: `M_system1 / M_system2`.

**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**
For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K₁ and K₂). The relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law:

M_total = [P * (K₁ + K₂)^3] / [2πG * sin³(i)]

where:
*   `G` is the gravitational constant.
*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.

**3. Analyze the "Careful Points" and Simplify**
*   **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information. For an eclipse to be observed, the orbital plane must be aligned very closely with our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.
*   **Simplification:** If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly for both systems.
*   **Ratio Calculation:** We are asked for a ratio of the two masses. When we set up the ratio `M_system1 / M_system2`, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` and the `sin³(i)` term (which is ~1 for both) will cancel out.

This leaves us with a simple proportionality:
M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)^3

The ratio is therefore:
`M_system1 / M_system2 = (P₁ / P₂) * [(K_total1) / (K_total2)]³`

**4. List the Given Values and Calculate Totals**
*   **System 1:**
    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years
    *   Sum of velocities (K_total1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s
*   **System 2:**
    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year
    *   Sum of velocities (K_total2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s

**5. Perform the Final Calculation**
Substitute the values into the simplified ratio formula:

Ratio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³

First, simplify the fraction of the velocities:
15 / 25 = 3 / 5 = 0.6

Now, substitute this back into the equation:
Ratio = 2 * (0.6)³
Ratio = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)
Ratio = 2 * 0.216
Ratio = 0.432

**6. Compare with the Options**
The calculated factor is 0.432. We must find the closest option:
A) ~ 0.7
B) ~ 0.6
C) ~ 1.2
D) ~ 0.4

The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.
