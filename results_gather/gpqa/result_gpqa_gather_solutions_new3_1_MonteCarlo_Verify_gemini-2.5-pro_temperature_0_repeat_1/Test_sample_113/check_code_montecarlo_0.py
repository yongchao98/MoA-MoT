Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to identify reagent A.**

*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`
*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**. The reaction involves the addition of a hydrogen atom and a cyanide group across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond of a ketone.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.
    2.  This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.
    3.  This negatively charged intermediate must be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.
*   **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction.
    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and is an excellent proton source for this step.
    *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is used for a different type of carbonyl addition reaction and is not the correct reagent to complete cyanohydrin formation.
*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options C and D.

**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to identify reagent B.**

*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`
*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a **nitrile hydrolysis** reaction.
*   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water.
*   **Identifying Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. We must choose between the remaining options for B, which are `HCl` and `CH₃COOH`.
    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and highly effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this transformation to completion under typical laboratory conditions.
*   **Conclusion for B:** The most suitable reagent **B is HCl**.

**Step 3: Combine the findings and select the final answer.**

*   From Step 1, we determined that **A = H₃O⁺**.
*   From Step 2, we determined that **B = HCl**.

Matching this pair of reagents with the given options:
*   **A) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl**
*   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH
*   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH
*   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl

The correct combination is found in option A.
