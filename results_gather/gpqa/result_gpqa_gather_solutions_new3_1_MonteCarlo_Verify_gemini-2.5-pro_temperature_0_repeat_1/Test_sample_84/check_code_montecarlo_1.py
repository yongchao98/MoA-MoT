    delta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Å
    delta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Å

    # The problem provides extraneous information that is not needed for the ratio calculation:
    # M_star = 1.5 M_sun
    # R_star = 1.2 R_sun
    # T_eff = 6300 K
    # R_p1 = 1.7 R_earth
    # R_p2 = 1.3 R_earth
    # lambda_0 = 6300 Å
    # Albedo is the same for both planets.

    # --- Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) ---
    # The equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).
    # The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a).
    # So, a is proportional to (M_p / K)^2.
    # Therefore, a2 / a1 = (Mp2 / Mp1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2.
    # The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift delta_lambda.
    # So, K1 / K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2.
    
    # Let's calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes
    mass_ratio_2_over_1 = Mp2 / Mp1
    doppler_ratio_1_over_2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2
    
    a2_over_a1_ratio = (mass_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (doppler_ratio_1_over_2**2)
    
    # --- Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) ---
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)
    temp_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1_ratio)

    # Alternative simpler derivation:
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (K1 / K2)
    # temp_ratio_alt = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)
    # assert abs(temp_ratio - temp_ratio_alt) < 1e-9 # Check if both derivations yield the same result
