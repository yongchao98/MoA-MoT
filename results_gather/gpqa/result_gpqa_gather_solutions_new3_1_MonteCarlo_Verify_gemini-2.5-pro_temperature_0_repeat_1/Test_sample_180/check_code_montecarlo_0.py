def check_neutrino_flux_ratio():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the solar neutrino flux question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Define the standard, approximate fluxes for the relevant neutrino sources based on experimental data
       (e.g., from the Borexino experiment, as cited in some of the provided answers).
    2. The problem states the pp-III branch (source of 8B neutrinos) stops.
    3. Calculate the remaining flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV). The only source is the CNO cycle.
    4. Calculate the remaining flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV). The sources are the strong 7Be line and the CNO cycle.
    5. Compute the ratio of Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).
    6. Compare the computed ratio to the given multiple-choice options to find the closest one.
    7. Verify if the closest option matches the provided answer.
