    # A continuous energy spectrum for a subset of decay products occurs when the
    # total number of final-state particles is greater than two, allowing energy
    # to be shared in a variable way. We consider the light particles that share the bulk of the kinetic energy.

    # Original decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. Light particles = 2E + 2V (4 particles).
    # The problem states this is continuous, which is consistent with 4 > 2.
    
    # Variant decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. Light particles = 2E + M (3 particles).

            pass

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the endpoint of the spectrum ---
    # The endpoint is the maximum available kinetic energy, determined by the Q-value of the reaction.
    # Q-value = (mass_initial - mass_final) * c^2.
    # A higher Q-value means a higher endpoint.
    # A higher Q-value results from a lower total rest mass of the final products.

    # We compare the rest mass of the emitted light particles in both decays.
    # Let's represent the masses symbolically.
    # From the problem description:
    # - V is a "much lighter particle", implying mass_V > 0.
    # - M is an "exotic, massless particle", implying mass_M = 0.
    
    # Total rest mass of emitted light particles in the original decay: 2*mass_E + 2*mass_V
    # Total rest mass of emitted light particles in the variant decay:  2*mass_E + mass_M
    
    # Since mass_M = 0 and mass_V > 0, it is clear that:
    # (2*mass_E + mass_M) < (2*mass_E + 2*mass_V)
    
    # The total rest mass of the final products is lower in the variant decay.
    # This means more mass is converted into energy, so the Q-value is higher.

                f"1. Spectrum Nature: The variant decay has 3 light final-state particles (2E and M). Since this is more than two, the energy is shared, and the spectrum must remain continuous. This eliminates options B and C.\n"
                f"2. Endpoint: The original decay creates two massive V particles (mass_V > 0), while the variant creates one massless M particle (mass_M = 0). The total rest mass of the final products is therefore lower in the variant decay. According to E=mcÂ², a lower final mass means more energy is released. Thus, the Q-value and the corresponding endpoint must increase. This eliminates option D.\n"
