    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the relativistic travel problem.

    The final answer claims the correct option is A, which corresponds to 81 years.

    1. Checking the survival constraint: The travel time must be less than the astronaut's remaining lifespan.
    2. Performing the physics calculation (time dilation) using a standard astronomical distance.
