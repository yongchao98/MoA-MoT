    # --- Step-by-step deduction of the correct product ---

    # Step 1: Toluene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Product 1
    # This is an electrophilic nitration. The methyl group is an ortho, para-director.
    # The major product due to less steric hindrance is the para isomer.
    product_1 = "p-nitrotoluene"

    # Step 2: Product 1 + MnO2/H2SO4 -> Product 2
    # This is an oxidation. While MnO2/H2SO4 can be a strong oxidant, the context of
    # Step 3 (reaction with acetone and base) strongly implies a Claisen-Schmidt
    # condensation, which requires an aldehyde. Therefore, the most logical
    # interpretation is that the oxidation is controlled to yield the aldehyde.
    product_2 = "p-nitrobenzaldehyde"

    # Step 3: Product 2 + Acetone/NaOH -> Product 3
    # This is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The enolate of acetone attacks the
    # aldehyde, followed by dehydration to form a stable, conjugated enone.
    # The trans (E) isomer is the major product.
    product_3 = "(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one"

    # --- Determine the symmetry of the final product ---
    
    # The structure is O2N-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3.
    # 1. The molecule has an extended conjugated system, making its heavy-atom
    #    framework essentially planar.
    # 2. This molecular plane is a plane of symmetry (σ).
    # 3. The molecule is not symmetric end-to-end (nitrophenyl vs. acetyl group),
    #    so it lacks any C2 (or higher) rotational axes and a center of inversion (i).
    # A molecule with only the identity (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ)
    # belongs to the Cs point group.
