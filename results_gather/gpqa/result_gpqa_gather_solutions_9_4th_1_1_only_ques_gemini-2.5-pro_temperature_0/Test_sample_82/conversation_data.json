Careful Point: The Initial Dilution**\nThe first step is to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water. This is a crucial step that must be performed before any titration calculations.\n*   **Formula:** M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\nThe solution being titrated is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Careful Point: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**\nAt this point, the solution contains a mixture of the weak acid and its conjugate base, forming a buffer.

The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is therefore 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Careful Point: pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base, not by simple neutralization (pH will not be 7.00).\n*   **Calculate Moles of Acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol.\n*   **Calculate Volume of NaOH Added:** At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Calculate Concentration of Acetate (Careful Point: Use Total Volume):** The total volume is the sum of the diluted acid and the added NaOH.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.0200 M**.\n*   **Calculate pH from Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Calculate [OH⁻] using the approximation [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]).\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.0200) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe calculations robustly yield the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing this pair of values with the provided options:\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.57; 6.92\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct methodology from the provided answers and identifying the key points required for an accurate solution.\n\nThe candidate answers show a strong consensus on the numerical results of the calculation, but there is significant confusion in matching those results to the correct lettered option.

The Initial Dilution (A Critical First Step)**\nBefore any titration occurs, the acetic acid is diluted. It is crucial to calculate the new, lower concentration, as this is the actual starting point for the titration.\n*   **Formula:** M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration (The Buffer Region)**\nAt this stage, 25% of the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base, creating a buffer solution.

This is a crucial first step that must be done before any titration calculations.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve. I will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`, to find the pH. This requires calculating the pKa from the given Ka and determining the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid at the 25% mark.\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base. I will calculate the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate), find its Kb value, and then calculate the resulting [OH⁻] concentration to determine the pOH and finally the pH.\n4.  **Final Comparison**: I will compare the two calculated pH values with the provided options (A, B, C, D) to determine the correct answer.\n\nI will implement these steps in a Python script to ensure precision and avoid manual calculation errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_titration_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point for the given problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given values and constants ---\n    initial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\n    initial_vol_acid_cm3 = 20.00\n    vol_water_cm3 = 20.00\n    conc_naoh = 0.1  # M\n    Ka_acid = 1.85e-5\n    Kw = 1.0e-14\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution ---\n    # The number of moles of acid remains constant.\n    # M1V1 = M2V2\n    final_vol_acid_cm3 = initial_vol_acid_cm3 + vol_water_cm3\n    conc_acid_after_dilution = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid_cm3) / final_vol_acid_cm3\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration (Buffer Region) ---\n    # Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n    pKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n    \n    # At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\n    ratio_base_to_acid = 1 / 3\n    ph_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_base_to_acid)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point ---\n    # First, find the initial moles of acid being titrated.\n    initial_moles_acid = conc_acid_after_dilution * (final_vol_acid_cm3 / 1000)\n    \n    # At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = initial moles of acid.\n    # Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n    vol_naoh_eq_L = initial_moles_acid / conc_naoh\n    \n    # Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point.\n    total_vol_eq_L = (final_vol_acid_cm3 / 1000) + vol_naoh_eq_L\n    \n    # Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at this point.\n    conc_acetate = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n    \n    # The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n    # A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n    # We need Kb for the acetate ion.\n    Kb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\n    \n    # Calculate [OH-] using the approximation for a weak base: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n    conc_oh = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n    \n    # Calculate pOH and then pH.\n    pOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_oh)\n    ph_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the results and identify the correct option ---\n    print(f\"The calculated pH at 25% titration is: {ph_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The calculated pH at the equivalence point is: {ph_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nComparing the calculated pair (4.26; 8.52) with the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) 4.26; 8.52\")\n    print(\"B) 4.57; 6.92\")\n    print(\"C) 4.73; 7.00\")\n    print(\"D) 3.17; 6.73\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe calculated values match option A.\")\n\nsolve_titration_problem()\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\nThe calculated pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n\nComparing the calculated pair (4.26; 8.52) with the given options:\nA) 4.26; 8.52\nB) 4.57; 6.92\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 3.17; 6.73\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct methodology from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the final, correct choice.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem and Careful Points**\n\nThe problem requires calculating the pH at two specific points during the titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH). The key steps and potential pitfalls are:\n\n1.  **Initial Dilution:** This is a critical first step. The starting concentration of 0.05 M is not the concentration being titrated. The acid is first diluted, and this new, lower concentration must be calculated and used for all subsequent steps.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point lies in the buffer region of the titration curve. The solution contains a significant amount of both the weak acid and its conjugate base. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method for this calculation.\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate weak base (acetate). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water, which produces OH⁻ ions. The pH will be basic (greater than 7), and the calculation must account for the total volume of the solution to find the correct concentration of the conjugate base.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe candidate answers almost unanimously agree on the numerical results of the calculation, even if they disagree on the final letter choice. Let's verify these calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n*   We use the dilution formula: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Concentration (M₂): M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n    *This is the concentration of the acetic acid solution that is being titrated.*\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n*   This is a buffer solution, so we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains. The ratio [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n*   First, find the initial moles of acid being titrated:\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize this amount of acid:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] at this point:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   Now, calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate (A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻). We need the base dissociation constant, Kb:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Use the equilibrium expression for the weak base to find [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis confirms the numerical results found by the majority of the agents:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThe confusion in the candidate answers arises from matching these correct numerical results to the lettered options, which appear to have been shuffled for different agents.

The primary discrepancy lies in matching these correct values to the lettered options provided in the original question. The following analysis confirms the calculations and identifies the correct option.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Account for the Initial Dilution:** This is a critical first step. The concentration of the acetic acid solution changes before the titration begins.\n    *   **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid:** Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   **Final Volume after Dilution:** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n    *   **New Concentration for Titration:** Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\n\n2.  **Calculate pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region):** At this stage, the solution contains both the weak acid and its conjugate base, forming a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method.\n    *   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    *   **Calculate pKa:** pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   **Determine the Ratio:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains. The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n    *   **Calculate pH:** pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis):** At the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base, which makes the solution alkaline.\n    *   **Volume of NaOH Added:** To neutralize 0.001 mol of acid with 0.1 M NaOH, the required volume is: Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   **Total Volume:** The total volume at the equivalence point is the sum of the diluted acid and the added NaOH: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion is the initial moles of acid divided by the total volume: [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n    *   **Hydrolysis Calculation:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water (CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻). We must find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻].\n        *   First, calculate Kb for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n        *   Next, calculate [OH⁻] using the approximation for a weak base: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   **Final pH Calculation:**\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe verified calculations yield a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and a pH of **8.52** at the equivalence point. Comparing this pair of values to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.57; 6.92\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.73; 7.00\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the chemical calculations, here is the definitive solution.\n\nThere is a strong consensus among all candidate answers regarding the numerical results of the calculation. The discrepancies arise only from matching these correct numerical results to the lettered options, which appear to have been presented in a different order to different agents. By performing a single, careful calculation and matching it to the options as presented in the original question, the correct answer can be determined.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem is solved in three main stages: accounting for the initial dilution, calculating the pH in the buffer region (25% titration), and calculating the pH at the equivalence point (hydrolysis).\n\n**1. Careful Point: The Initial Dilution**\nThe first and most critical step is to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water. Failing to do this is a common mistake.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Concentration (M₂): (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**.\nThis is the concentration of the acetic acid solution that is actually being titrated.\n\n**2. Careful Point: The Buffer Region (pH at 25% Titration)**\nAt 25% titration, the solution contains a mixture of the unreacted weak acid (75%) and its newly formed conjugate base (25%). This is a classic buffer solution, and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct way to find the pH.\n*   The equation is: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n*   First, we calculate pKa from the given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵:\n    pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   Now, we calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Careful Point: The Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base (acetate). The pH is not neutral (7.00) because this conjugate base hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic. The total volume of the solution also changes, which must be accounted for.\n*   First, find the initial moles of acid being titrated:\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize this amount of acid:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   Now, calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate (CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻). We need the base dissociation constant, Kb:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Use the equilibrium expression for the weak base to find [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Finally, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe verified calculations yield the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing this pair of values with the options provided in the question:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.73; 7.00\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification of the calculation, here is the definitive solution.\n\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is that the numerical calculations are correct, but there is confusion in matching the final result to the lettered options.

The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   **Moles of Acid**:\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of NaOH Added**: At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Concentration of Acetate**: The total volume is the sum of the diluted acid and the added NaOH.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **pH from Hydrolysis**: The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Calculate [OH⁻] using the approximation [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]).\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe verified calculations yield the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing this result with the provided options:\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 4.57; 6.92\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The discrepancies arise only from matching these correct numerical results to the lettered options, which appear to have been presented in a different order to different agents. By performing a single, careful calculation and matching it to the options as presented in the original question, the correct answer can be determined.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem is solved in three main stages: accounting for the initial dilution, calculating the pH in the buffer region (25% titration), and calculating the pH at the equivalence point (hydrolysis).\n\n**1. Careful Point: The Initial Dilution**\nThe first and most critical step is to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water. Failing to do this is a common mistake.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Concentration (M₂): (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**.\nThis is the concentration of the acetic acid solution that is actually being titrated.\n\n**2. Careful Point: The Buffer Region (pH at 25% Titration)**\nAt 25% titration, the solution contains a mixture of the unreacted weak acid (75%) and its newly formed conjugate base (25%). This is a classic buffer solution, and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct way to find the pH.\n*   The equation is: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n*   First, we calculate pKa from the given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵:\n    pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   Now, we calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Careful Point: The Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base (acetate). The pH is not neutral (7.00) because this conjugate base hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic. The total volume of the solution also changes, which must be accounted for.\n*   First, find the initial moles of acid being titrated:\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize this amount of acid:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   Now, calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate (CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻). We need the base dissociation constant, Kb:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Use the equilibrium expression for the weak base to find [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Finally, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe verified calculations yield the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing this pair of values with the options provided in the question:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.73; 7.00\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification of the calculation, here is the definitive solution.\n\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is that the numerical calculations are correct, but there is confusion in matching the final result to the lettered options.

The initial 0.05 M acetic acid is not the concentration being titrated. It is first diluted.\n*   **Formula**: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁)**: 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁)**: 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂)**: 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂)**: M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\nThis is the starting concentration of the acetic acid for the titration.\n\n**Careful Point 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**\nAt this point, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, creating a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the correct tool.\n*   **Equation**: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   **pKa Calculation**: First, we find the pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Ratio Determination**: At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base [A⁻] to the acid [HA] is 25% to 75%, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation**:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   **Moles of Acid**:\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of NaOH Added**: At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Concentration of Acetate**: The total volume is the sum of the diluted acid and the added NaOH.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **pH from Hydrolysis**: The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Calculate [OH⁻] using the approximation [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]).\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe verified calculations yield the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing this result with the provided options:\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 4.57; 6.92\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
