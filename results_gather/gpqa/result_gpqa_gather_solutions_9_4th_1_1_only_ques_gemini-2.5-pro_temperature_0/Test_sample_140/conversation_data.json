Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) treated with sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key reactive intermediate in this mechanism is a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two distinct ortho positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   The C6 position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The C2 position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Both pathways must be considered.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products. Although abstraction of H is kinetically favored over D (due to the kinetic isotope effect, where C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds), both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: This intermediate is unsymmetrical.** The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *This pathway yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: This intermediate is symmetrical.** Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  The product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    *This pathway yields one distinct product.*\n\n**4.

Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) treated with sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key reactive intermediate in this mechanism is a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is an elimination reaction initiated by the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻). The base abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine-bearing carbon.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two possible abstraction sites.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Both pathways must be considered.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products. Although the abstraction of the proton from C6 is kinetically favored over the deuteron from C2 (due to the kinetic isotope effect, where C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds), both pathways are possible and will occur to some extent.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: This intermediate is unsymmetrical.** The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. Protonation of the resulting carbanion at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6.

The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) makes breaking a C-H bond faster than a C-D bond, but the C-D bond can still be broken.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains, yielding **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the molecule in this step, yielding the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nThis first step results in the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Products from the unsymmetrical intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne).** Because this intermediate is not symmetrical, nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The final product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. After renumbering to prioritize the amino group, the final product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Product from the symmetrical intermediate (benzyne).** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product.\n    3.  The final product is **aniline**.\n\n**4.
