This is a **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires vigorous conditions, typically heating with a **strong acid** or a **strong base** as a catalyst.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent B must be a strong catalyst**.\n    *   Comparing the choices, `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for this transformation. `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to catalyze this reaction efficiently.\n    *   **Conclusion for B: B = HCl**.\n\n3.  **Combine and Select the Final Answer:**\n    *   The correct combination of reagents is **A = H3O+** and **B = HCl**.\n    *   Now, I will match this combination with the specific options provided in the question:\n        *   A) A = H3O+, B = HCl\n        *   B) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH\n        *   C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl\n        *   D) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH\n    *   The combination `A = H3O+` and `B = HCl` perfectly matches **option A**.\n\n4.  **Review of Candidate Answers:**\n    *   All candidate answers correctly identify the chemical principles: A must be `H3O+`, and B must be `HCl`. There is a clear consensus on the chemistry.\n    *   The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to them referencing different, shuffled versions of the option list.

First, the cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate (an alkoxide). Second, this intermediate must be protonated to form the final, stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction.\n*   **Evaluating the Options for A:**\n    *   `H3O⁺` (hydronium ion): This represents an aqueous acid and is the standard reagent used to provide protons for this step.\n    *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite): This is used for a different type of reaction (bisulfite addition) and is not the correct reagent for protonating the intermediate in cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The correct reagent is **H3O⁺**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile functional group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).

It is generally not strong enough to catalyze this transformation efficiently.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The correct reagent is the strong acid, **HCl**.\n\n### **Step 3: Combine Conclusions and Select the Final Answer**\n\n*   Based on the analysis of the first reaction, reagent **A must be H3O⁺**.\n*   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, reagent **B must be HCl**.\n\nThe correct pair of reagents is therefore `A = H3O⁺` and `B = HCl`.\n\nNow, we match this conclusion to the provided options:\nA) A = H3O+, B = HCl\nB) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH\nC) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH\nD) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl\n\nThe combination `A = H3O⁺` and `B = HCl` corresponds to option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is unanimously correct: the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation needing H3O⁺, and the second is a nitrile hydrolysis needing a strong acid like HCl.\n*   The discrepancy in the final lettered answers among the candidates is due to different ordering of the options they were presented with.\n*   The final decision must be based on the chemical principles and the specific options provided in the question prompt.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a **cyanohydrin formation**.
