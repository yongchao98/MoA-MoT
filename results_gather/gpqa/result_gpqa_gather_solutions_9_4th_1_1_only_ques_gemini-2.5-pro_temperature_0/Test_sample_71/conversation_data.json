Analysis of the Overall Reaction Scheme**\n\nThe problem describes a classic \"trap-modify-release\" synthetic strategy. This involves:\n*   **Trap:** Generating a highly reactive molecule and immediately reacting it with a stable \"trap\" molecule to form a stable adduct.\n*   **Modify:** Performing chemical transformations on the stable adduct.\n*   **Release:** Reversing the initial trapping reaction, usually by heating, to release the modified molecule of interest.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Chemical Transformations**\n\n*   **Step 1: Diene Generation and Trapping (Formation of Product 1)**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Reactive Diene.** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is intended to generate a reactive diene *in situ*. While the name is unusual, the reaction of 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivatives with NaI is a standard textbook method for generating the highly reactive diene **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene). This is the most chemically plausible interpretation in the context of this type of problem.\n    *   **Trapping Reaction:** The generated o-quinodimethane undergoes a double Diels-Alder reaction with the two double bonds of the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a large, symmetric bis-adduct (**Product 1**) is formed.\n\n*   **Step 2: Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n    *   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming the alcohol **Product 2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing the secondary alcohol at the C7 bridge position to a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Release and Final Transformation (Formation of Product 4)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the Final Product.** Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This causes the molecule to fragment, releasing its original components:\n        1.  Two molecules of **o-quinodimethane**.\n        2.  One molecule of the dienophile core, now **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    *   The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is thermally unstable and readily decomposes by extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n    *   The two molecules of highly reactive o-quinodimethane are generated in close proximity at high temperature. They will not persist as monomers. They will immediately react with each other, primarily through dimerization. The \"final product 4\" must be this stable, isolable dimer. The major thermal dimerization product of o-quinodimethane is the [4+4] cycloadduct, **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n\n*   **Structure and Formula:** The molecule consists of two benzene rings fused to a central, non-planar eight-membered ring. Its chemical formula is C₁₆H₁₆.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis passes through the center of the molecule and relates the two identical halves to each other.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** The presence of a C₂ axis means that for every hydrogen atom, there is exactly one other hydrogen atom that is chemically equivalent to it. Therefore, the number of distinct hydrogen environments is half the total number of hydrogens.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 16\n    *   Number of distinct hydrogen environments = 16 / 2 = **8**.\n*   **Detailed Confirmation:**\n    *   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** We analyze one of the two equivalent benzene rings. It is an ortho-disubstituted ring attached to a rigid, chiral framework. Consequently, all four protons on this ring are in unique chemical environments. This gives **4 distinct aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** We analyze one of the two equivalent `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges. The molecule is chiral, so the two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic (non-equivalent). Furthermore, the two methylene groups themselves are in different environments. Thus, all four aliphatic protons on one bridge are chemically distinct. This gives **4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n    *   **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nThis number corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer. The analysis synthesizes the most chemically plausible steps discussed across the candidate answers.\n\n### **Overall Reaction Scheme**\n\nThe problem describes a classic \"trap-modify-release\" synthesis. This strategy is used to perform chemical transformations on a highly reactive molecule by first trapping it in a stable form (a Diels-Alder adduct), modifying the stable adduct, and finally releasing the modified molecule via a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n### **Careful Point 1: The Identity of the Reactive Diene (Step 1)**\n\nThe first step is the *in situ* generation of a reactive diene from `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The identity of this diene is the first critical decision point.\n\n*   **Plausible Interpretation:** In the context of advanced organic chemistry problems, complex or unusual chemical names are often used as stand-ins for precursors to common, well-known reactive intermediates. The reaction of a 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivative with NaI is a standard textbook method for generating the highly reactive diene **o-quinodimethane** (also known as *o*-xylylene). This interpretation is the most chemically sound and is consistent with the overall \"trap-modify-release\" strategy.\n*   **The \"Trap\":** The generated o-quinodimethane is immediately trapped by the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, in a double Diels-Alder reaction to form the stable adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n### **Careful Point 2: The Modification Steps (Steps 2 & 3)**\n\nThese steps are chemically unambiguous and standard transformations.\n\n*   **Step 2 (Deprotection):** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether, converting the -OtBu group to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming the alcohol **Product 2**.\n*   **Step 3 (Oxidation):** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 bridge position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n### **Careful Point 3: The Identity of the Final Product (Step 4)**\n\nThis is the second and most critical decision point. Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n*   **Fragmentation:** The reaction causes Product 3 to fragment, releasing its original components:\n    1.  Two molecules of the reactive diene, **o-quinodimethane**.\n    2.  One molecule of the dienophile core, which is now **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Fate of the Fragments:**\n    *   The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly decomposes by extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n    *   The two molecules of highly reactive o-quinodimethane are generated in close proximity at high temperature. They will not persist as monomers. They will immediately react with each other.\n*   **Identifying \"Product 4\":** The question asks for the analysis of the \"final product 4\". A final product in a synthesis context refers to a stable, isolable species. The highly reactive o-quinodimethane monomer does not fit this description. Therefore, **Product 4 must be the stable product formed from the dimerization of o-quinodimethane**. The major thermal dimerization product is the [4+4] cycloadduct, **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n### **Final Analysis: Counting the Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n\n*   **Structure and Formula:** The molecule consists of two benzene rings fused to a central, non-planar eight-membered ring. Its chemical formula is C₁₆H₁₆.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis passes through the center of the molecule and relates the two identical halves to each other.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** The presence of a C₂ axis means that for every hydrogen atom, there is exactly one other hydrogen atom that is chemically equivalent to it. Therefore, the number of distinct hydrogen environments is exactly half the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 16\n    *   Number of Distinct Hydrogens = 16 / 2 = **8**.\n*   **Detailed Confirmation:**\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:** Analyzing one of the two equivalent benzene rings, we find it is ortho-disubstituted and attached to a rigid, chiral framework. Consequently, all four protons on this ring are in unique chemical environments. This gives **4 distinct aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** Analyzing one of the two equivalent `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges, we find that due to the molecule's rigid and chiral nature, the two `-CH₂-` groups are in different environments, and the two protons on each `-CH₂-` group are diastereotopic (non-equivalent). This gives **4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n    3.  **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nThis result, 8, corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex multi-step organic synthesis problem. To determine the final answer, I will break down the reaction sequence, identify the most plausible chemical transformations at each step, determine the structure of the final product, and then analyze its symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactive Diene (Step 1):** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is intended to generate a reactive diene *in situ*. While the name is unusual, in the context of a \"trap-modify-release\" synthesis, this is a classic precursor for **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene). This is a more chemically sound interpretation than a literal one.\n\n2.  **Follow the \"Trap-Modify-Release\" Sequence (Steps 1-4):**\n    *   **Trap (Product 1):** The generated o-quinodimethane is \"trapped\" by the dienophile (`7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`) in a double Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Modify (Products 2 & 3):** The resulting adduct is first deprotected with acid (tert-butyl ether -> alcohol) to give **Product 2**, and then oxidized (alcohol -> ketone) to give **Product 3**. These are standard, unambiguous transformations.\n    *   **Release (Formation of Product 4):** Heating **Product 3** induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This breaks the adduct apart, releasing two molecules of o-quinodimethane and one molecule of `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final, Stable Product (Product 4):** The term \"final product\" refers to a stable, isolable species.\n    *   The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` fragment is thermally unstable and decomposes to stable **benzene** and carbon monoxide (CO).\n    *   The two molecules of o-quinodimethane are highly reactive and will not persist as monomers. They will immediately react with each other. The major thermal reaction is dimerization.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 4** is the stable dimer of o-quinodimethane, which is **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4:**\n    *   **Structure and Symmetry:** The final product, `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`, has the formula C₁₆H₁₆. Its most stable conformation possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**, which relates the two identical halves of the molecule.\n    *   **Calculation:** Due to this symmetry, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is exactly half the total number of hydrogens.\n    *   **Confirmation:** The molecule has 8 aromatic and 8 aliphatic hydrogens. The C₂ symmetry makes the two benzene rings equivalent and the two `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges equivalent.\n        *   Within one benzene ring, all 4 protons are in unique environments due to the rigid, chiral structure. (4 distinct aromatic Hs)\n        *   Within one `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridge, all 4 protons are also in unique environments (diastereotopic). (4 distinct aliphatic Hs)\n        *   The total number of distinct hydrogens is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n5.  **Match to Options:** The calculated number is 8.

While the name is unusual, in the context of such problems, it is a common pattern for a complex name to represent a precursor to a well-known reactive intermediate. The reaction of a 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivative with NaI is a standard textbook method for generating **o-quinodimethane** (also known as *o*-xylylene). This is the most chemically plausible interpretation.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Trapping Reaction.** The generated o-quinodimethane is a highly reactive diene. It is immediately \"trapped\" by the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of o-quinodimethane adding to each of the two double bonds of the dienophile. This forms a large, stable, and symmetric polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Modification 1 - Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard and unambiguous acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming the alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Modification 2 - Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n*   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild and standard method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone.

This irreversible step drives the retro-Diels-Alder reaction to completion.\n*   The two molecules of highly reactive o-quinodimethane are generated in close proximity at high temperature. They will not persist as monomers. They will immediately react with each other. The question asks for the analysis of the \"final product 4,\" which implies a stable, isolable molecule. Therefore, Product 4 is the **dimer of o-quinodimethane**.

The reaction of a 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivative with NaI is the standard textbook method for generating **o-quinodimethane** (also known as *o*-xylylene). This interpretation is the most chemically sound and is consistently identified by all the provided analyses.\n*   This reactive diene is then \"trapped\" by the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, in a double Diels-Alder reaction to form **Product 1**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Modification Steps (Steps 2 & 3)**\n\nThese steps are standard and unambiguous organic transformations.\n*   **Step 2:** Treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a standard acid-catalyzed deprotection that cleaves the tert-butyl ether (-OtBu) to form a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding **Product 2**.\n*   **Step 3:** Treatment with SO₃/pyridine in DMSO is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method that converts the secondary alcohol of Product 2 into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Identity of the Final Product (Step 4)**\n\nThis is the second critical decision point.\n*   **Release:** Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This causes the adduct to fragment, releasing its original components: two molecules of **o-quinodimethane** and one molecule of the central core, which is now **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Fate of Fragments:** The bicyclic ketone is thermally unstable and rapidly decomposes by extruding carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable molecule, **benzene**. The two molecules of o-quinodimethane are highly reactive and are generated in close proximity at high temperature. They cannot be isolated as monomers.\n*   **What is \"Product 4\"?** The question asks for the analysis of the \"final product 4\". A final product must be a stable, isolable species. The highly reactive o-quinodimethane monomer does not fit this description. Therefore, **Product 4 must be the stable product formed from the dimerization of o-quinodimethane.** The major thermal dimerization product is the [4+4] cycloadduct, **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n### **Analysis of Product 4's Structure**\n\nThe final task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n\n*   **Structure and Formula:** The molecule consists of two benzene rings fused to a central, non-planar eight-membered ring. Its chemical formula is C₁₆H₁₆.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis passes through the center of the molecule and relates the two identical halves to each other.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** The presence of a C₂ axis means that for every hydrogen atom, there is exactly one other hydrogen atom that is chemically equivalent to it. Therefore, the number of distinct hydrogen environments is exactly half the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 16\n    *   Number of Distinct Hydrogens = 16 / 2 = **8**.\n*   **Detailed Confirmation:**\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:** Analyzing one of the two equivalent benzene rings, we find it is ortho-disubstituted and attached to a rigid, chiral framework. Consequently, all four protons on this ring are in unique chemical environments. This gives **4 distinct aromatic signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** Analyzing one of the two equivalent `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges, we find that the two `-CH₂-` groups are in different environments, and the two protons on each `-CH₂-` group are diastereotopic (non-equivalent) due to the molecule's chirality. This gives **4 distinct aliphatic signals**.\n    3.  **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nThis number corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem, highlighting the critical points to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe overall process is a classic \"trap-modify-release\" synthetic strategy.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Diene Generation and Trapping (Formation of Product 1)**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Identity of the Reactive Diene.** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is intended to generate a reactive diene *in situ*. The consensus among all analyses is that the most chemically plausible interpretation is not a literal one, but one based on common synthetic patterns. The reaction of a 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivative with NaI is a standard method for generating the highly reactive intermediate **o-quinodimethane** (*o*-xylylene). The complex name in the problem is best understood as a precursor to this species.\n    *   **Trapping:** Two equivalents of the generated o-quinodimethane are \"trapped\" by the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, via a double Diels-Alder reaction to form a stable, symmetric adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n    *   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard and unambiguous acid-catalyzed cleavage of the tert-butyl ether, converting the -OtBu group to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a standard, mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at the bridge position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Release and Final Product Formation (Formation of Product 4)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Identity of the Final Product.** Heating Product 3 induces a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This causes the molecule to fragment into its original components: two molecules of o-quinodimethane and one molecule of `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    *   The bicyclic ketone is thermally unstable and rapidly decomposes, extruding carbon monoxide (CO) to form stable **benzene**.\n    *   The two molecules of o-quinodimethane are highly reactive and will not persist as monomers at 150°C. The term \"final product\" implies a stable, isolable species. Therefore, the two molecules of o-quinodimethane react with each other. The major thermal reaction is dimerization.\n    *   **Product 4** is the stable dimer of o-quinodimethane, which is **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`. Its chemical formula is C₁₆H₁₆.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry.** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**.

Due to symmetry, we analyze one benzene ring. It is ortho-disubstituted and attached to a rigid, chiral framework, making all four of its protons chemically distinct. This gives **4 distinct aromatic signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** There are 8 aliphatic protons in total. Due to symmetry, we analyze one `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridge. The molecule's chirality makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic (non-equivalent), and the two methylene groups themselves are in different environments.

The most chemically sound interpretation, consistent with the context of this type of problem, is that the precursor is a stand-in for a 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivative. The reaction with NaI is a standard method for generating the highly reactive intermediate **o-quinodimethane** (also known as *o*-xylylene). This diene is then \"trapped\" by the dienophile (`7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`) in a double Diels-Alder reaction to form the stable adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Modification Steps (Steps 2 & 3)**\n\nThe subsequent two steps modify the trapped adduct.

Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a cascade of reactions:\n1.  **Retro-Diels-Alder Reaction:** The adduct (Product 3) fragments, reversing the initial trapping reaction. This \"releases\" two molecules of the reactive diene (*o*-quinodimethane) and one molecule of the dienophile core, which is now `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n2.  **Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is thermally unstable and rapidly decomposes by extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.

This involves:\n*   **Trap:** Generating a highly reactive molecule and immediately reacting it with a stable \"trap\" molecule to form a stable adduct.\n*   **Modify:** Performing chemical transformations on the stable adduct.\n*   **Release:** Reversing the initial trapping reaction, usually by heating, to release the modified molecule of interest.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Chemical Transformations**\n\n*   **Step 1: Diene Generation and Trapping (Formation of Product 1)**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Reactive Diene.** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is intended to generate a reactive diene *in situ*. While the name is unusual, the reaction of 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivatives with NaI is a standard textbook method for generating the highly reactive diene **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene). This is the most chemically plausible interpretation in the context of this type of problem.\n    *   **Trapping Reaction:** The generated o-quinodimethane undergoes a double Diels-Alder reaction with the two double bonds of the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a large, symmetric bis-adduct (**Product 1**) is formed.\n\n*   **Step 2: Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n    *   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming the alcohol **Product 2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing the secondary alcohol at the C7 bridge position to a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Release and Final Transformation (Formation of Product 4)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the Final Product.** Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This causes the molecule to fragment, releasing its original components:\n        1.  Two molecules of **o-quinodimethane**.\n        2.  One molecule of the dienophile core, now **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    *   The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is thermally unstable and readily decomposes by extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n    *   The two molecules of highly reactive o-quinodimethane are generated in close proximity at high temperature. They will not persist as monomers. They will immediately react with each other, primarily through dimerization. The \"final product 4\" must be this stable, isolable dimer. The major thermal dimerization product of o-quinodimethane is the [4+4] cycloadduct, **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n### **3.

Its chemical formula is C₁₆H₁₆.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis passes through the center of the molecule and relates the two identical halves to each other.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** The presence of a C₂ axis means that for every hydrogen atom, there is exactly one other hydrogen atom that is chemically equivalent to it. Therefore, the number of distinct hydrogen environments is half the total number of hydrogens.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 16\n    *   Number of distinct hydrogen environments = 16 / 2 = **8**.\n*   **Detailed Confirmation:**\n    *   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** We analyze one of the two equivalent benzene rings. It is an ortho-disubstituted ring attached to a rigid, chiral framework. Consequently, all four protons on this ring are in unique chemical environments. This gives **4 distinct aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** We analyze one of the two equivalent `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges. The molecule is chiral, so the two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic (non-equivalent). Furthermore, the two methylene groups themselves are in different environments. Thus, all four aliphatic protons on one bridge are chemically distinct. This gives **4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n    *   **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nThis number corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer. The analysis synthesizes the most chemically plausible steps discussed across the candidate answers.\n\n### **Overall Reaction Scheme**\n\nThe problem describes a classic \"trap-modify-release\" synthesis. This strategy is used to perform chemical transformations on a highly reactive molecule by first trapping it in a stable form (a Diels-Alder adduct), modifying the stable adduct, and finally releasing the modified molecule via a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n### **Careful Point 1: The Identity of the Reactive Diene (Step 1)**\n\nThe first step is the *in situ* generation of a reactive diene from `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The identity of this diene is the first critical decision point.\n\n*   **Plausible Interpretation:** In the context of advanced organic chemistry problems, complex or unusual chemical names are often used as stand-ins for precursors to common, well-known reactive intermediates. The reaction of a 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivative with NaI is a standard textbook method for generating the highly reactive diene **o-quinodimethane** (also known as *o*-xylylene). This interpretation is the most chemically sound and is consistent with the overall \"trap-modify-release\" strategy.\n*   **The \"Trap\":** The generated o-quinodimethane is immediately trapped by the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, in a double Diels-Alder reaction to form the stable adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n### **Careful Point 2: The Modification Steps (Steps 2 & 3)**\n\nThese steps are chemically unambiguous and standard transformations.\n\n*   **Step 2 (Deprotection):** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether, converting the -OtBu group to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming the alcohol **Product 2**.\n*   **Step 3 (Oxidation):** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 bridge position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n### **Careful Point 3: The Identity of the Final Product (Step 4)**\n\nThis is the second and most critical decision point. Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n*   **Fragmentation:** The reaction causes Product 3 to fragment, releasing its original components:\n    1.  Two molecules of the reactive diene, **o-quinodimethane**.\n    2.  One molecule of the dienophile core, which is now **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Fate of the Fragments:**\n    *   The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly decomposes by extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n    *   The two molecules of highly reactive o-quinodimethane are generated in close proximity at high temperature. They will not persist as monomers. They will immediately react with each other.\n*   **Identifying \"Product 4\":** The question asks for the analysis of the \"final product 4\". A final product in a synthesis context refers to a stable, isolable species. The highly reactive o-quinodimethane monomer does not fit this description. Therefore, **Product 4 must be the stable product formed from the dimerization of o-quinodimethane**. The major thermal dimerization product is the [4+4] cycloadduct, **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n### **Final Analysis: Counting the Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n\n*   **Structure and Formula:** The molecule consists of two benzene rings fused to a central, non-planar eight-membered ring. Its chemical formula is C₁₆H₁₆.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis passes through the center of the molecule and relates the two identical halves to each other.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** The presence of a C₂ axis means that for every hydrogen atom, there is exactly one other hydrogen atom that is chemically equivalent to it. Therefore, the number of distinct hydrogen environments is exactly half the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 16\n    *   Number of Distinct Hydrogens = 16 / 2 = **8**.\n*   **Detailed Confirmation:**\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:** Analyzing one of the two equivalent benzene rings, we find it is ortho-disubstituted and attached to a rigid, chiral framework. Consequently, all four protons on this ring are in unique chemical environments. This gives **4 distinct aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** Analyzing one of the two equivalent `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges, we find that due to the molecule's rigid and chiral nature, the two `-CH₂-` groups are in different environments, and the two protons on each `-CH₂-` group are diastereotopic (non-equivalent). This gives **4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n    3.  **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nThis result, 8, corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex multi-step organic synthesis problem. To determine the final answer, I will break down the reaction sequence, identify the most plausible chemical transformations at each step, determine the structure of the final product, and then analyze its symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactive Diene (Step 1):** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is intended to generate a reactive diene *in situ*. While the name is unusual, in the context of a \"trap-modify-release\" synthesis, this is a classic precursor for **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene). This is a more chemically sound interpretation than a literal one.\n\n2.  **Follow the \"Trap-Modify-Release\" Sequence (Steps 1-4):**\n    *   **Trap (Product 1):** The generated o-quinodimethane is \"trapped\" by the dienophile (`7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`) in a double Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Modify (Products 2 & 3):** The resulting adduct is first deprotected with acid (tert-butyl ether -> alcohol) to give **Product 2**, and then oxidized (alcohol -> ketone) to give **Product 3**. These are standard, unambiguous transformations.\n    *   **Release (Formation of Product 4):** Heating **Product 3** induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This breaks the adduct apart, releasing two molecules of o-quinodimethane and one molecule of `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final, Stable Product (Product 4):** The term \"final product\" refers to a stable, isolable species.\n    *   The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` fragment is thermally unstable and decomposes to stable **benzene** and carbon monoxide (CO).\n    *   The two molecules of o-quinodimethane are highly reactive and will not persist as monomers. They will immediately react with each other. The major thermal reaction is dimerization.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 4** is the stable dimer of o-quinodimethane, which is **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4:**\n    *   **Structure and Symmetry:** The final product, `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`, has the formula C₁₆H₁₆. Its most stable conformation possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**, which relates the two identical halves of the molecule.\n    *   **Calculation:** Due to this symmetry, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is exactly half the total number of hydrogens.\n    *   **Confirmation:** The molecule has 8 aromatic and 8 aliphatic hydrogens. The C₂ symmetry makes the two benzene rings equivalent and the two `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges equivalent.\n        *   Within one benzene ring, all 4 protons are in unique environments due to the rigid, chiral structure. (4 distinct aromatic Hs)\n        *   Within one `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridge, all 4 protons are also in unique environments (diastereotopic). (4 distinct aliphatic Hs)\n        *   The total number of distinct hydrogens is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n5.  **Match to Options:** The calculated number is 8.

This is the most chemically plausible interpretation.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Trapping Reaction.** The generated o-quinodimethane is a highly reactive diene. It is immediately \"trapped\" by the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of o-quinodimethane adding to each of the two double bonds of the dienophile. This forms a large, stable, and symmetric polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Modification 1 - Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard and unambiguous acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming the alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Modification 2 - Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n*   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild and standard method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone.

The complex name in the problem is best understood as a precursor to this species.\n    *   **Trapping:** Two equivalents of the generated o-quinodimethane are \"trapped\" by the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, via a double Diels-Alder reaction to form a stable, symmetric adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n    *   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard and unambiguous acid-catalyzed cleavage of the tert-butyl ether, converting the -OtBu group to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a standard, mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at the bridge position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Release and Final Product Formation (Formation of Product 4)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Identity of the Final Product.** Heating Product 3 induces a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This causes the molecule to fragment into its original components: two molecules of o-quinodimethane and one molecule of `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    *   The bicyclic ketone is thermally unstable and rapidly decomposes, extruding carbon monoxide (CO) to form stable **benzene**.\n    *   The two molecules of o-quinodimethane are highly reactive and will not persist as monomers at 150°C. The term \"final product\" implies a stable, isolable species. Therefore, the two molecules of o-quinodimethane react with each other. The major thermal reaction is dimerization.\n    *   **Product 4** is the stable dimer of o-quinodimethane, which is **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`. Its chemical formula is C₁₆H₁₆.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry.** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis relates the two identical halves of the molecule.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** The presence of a C₂ axis means that the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is exactly half the total number of hydrogens.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 16.\n    *   Number of distinct hydrogen environments = 16 / 2 = **8**.\n*   **Detailed Confirmation:**\n    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:** There are 8 aromatic protons in total. Due to symmetry, we analyze one benzene ring. It is ortho-disubstituted and attached to a rigid, chiral framework, making all four of its protons chemically distinct. This gives **4 distinct aromatic signals**.\n    2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** There are 8 aliphatic protons in total. Due to symmetry, we analyze one `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridge. The molecule's chirality makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic (non-equivalent), and the two methylene groups themselves are in different environments. This gives **4 distinct aliphatic signals**.\n    3.  **Total:** The total number of distinct hydrogen signals is 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer. The analysis synthesizes the most chemically plausible pathway, which is consistently identified across all candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Overall Reaction Strategy**\n\nThe four-step process described is a classic example of a \"trap-modify-release\" synthesis. This strategy is employed to perform chemical transformations on a highly reactive molecule that cannot be handled directly.\n1.  **Trap:** A reactive species is generated *in situ* and immediately trapped by a stable molecule (a dienophile) to form a stable adduct.\n2.  **Modify:** The stable adduct is chemically modified in one or more steps.\n3.  **Release:** The modified adduct is induced to fragment, releasing the modified version of the originally trapped reactive species.\n\n### **Careful Point 1: The Identity of the Reactive Diene (Step 1)**\n\nThe first step is the reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) to generate a reactive diene.\n*   **The Precursor:** In the context of advanced organic chemistry problems, a complex or unusual chemical name often serves as a precursor to a more common, well-known reactive intermediate.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction of a 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivative with NaI is a standard textbook method for the *in situ* generation of the highly reactive diene **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene). This is the most chemically plausible interpretation.\n*   **The Trapping:** Two molecules of the generated o-quinodimethane are \"trapped\" by the two double bonds of the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`, in a double Diels-Alder reaction to form the stable adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n### **Careful Point 2: The Modification Sequence (Steps 2 & 3)**\n\nThese two steps are standard and unambiguous chemical transformations.\n*   **Step 2 (Deprotection):** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **Product 2**.\n*   **Step 3 (Oxidation):** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 bridge position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n### **Careful Point 3: The Identity of the Final Product, 4 (Step 4)**\n\nThis is the most critical step for determining the final structure.\n*   **The Release:** Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This causes the adduct to fragment and \"release\" its components.\n*   **The Fragments:** The fragmentation yields two molecules of **o-quinodimethane** and one molecule of the central core, which is now **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Fate of the Fragments:**\n    1.  The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly decomposes by extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n    2.  The two molecules of o-quinodimethane are extremely reactive and are generated in close proximity at high temperature. They cannot be isolated as monomers. They will instantly react with each other.\n*   **Identifying Product 4:** The question asks for the analysis of the \"final product 4\". A final product must be a stable, isolable molecule. The highly reactive o-quinodimethane monomer does not fit this description. Therefore, **Product 4 is the stable dimer of o-quinodimethane**. The major thermal dimerization product is the [4+4] cycloadduct, **`trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n### **Final Analysis: Counting the Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n*   **Structure and Formula:** The molecule (C₁₆H₁₆) consists of two benzene rings fused to a central, non-planar eight-membered ring.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis relates the two identical halves of the molecule.\n*   **Hydrogen Count:** The presence of a C₂ axis means that for every hydrogen atom, there is exactly one other hydrogen atom that is chemically equivalent to it. Therefore, the number of distinct hydrogen environments is half the total number of hydrogens.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 16\n    *   Number of Distinct Hydrogens = 16 / 2 = **8**\n*   **Detailed Confirmation:**\n    *   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** Analyzing one of the two equivalent benzene rings, we find it is ortho-disubstituted and attached to a rigid, chiral framework. Consequently, all four protons on this ring are in unique chemical environments. This gives **4 distinct aromatic hydrogen signals**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** Analyzing one of the two equivalent `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridges, we find that the two `-CH₂-` groups are in different environments, and the two protons on each `-CH₂-` group are diastereotopic (non-equivalent) due to the molecule's chirality. This gives **4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen signals**.\n    *   **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying chemistry, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe overall process is a classic example of a \"trap-modify-release\" synthesis strategy, which is used to perform chemical transformations on highly reactive molecules that cannot be handled directly.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Identity of the Reactive Diene (Step 1)**\n\nThe first step is the *in situ* generation of a reactive diene from `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The most chemically sound interpretation, consistent with the context of this type of problem, is that the precursor is a stand-in for a 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene derivative. The reaction with NaI is a standard method for generating the highly reactive intermediate **o-quinodimethane** (also known as *o*-xylylene). This diene is then \"trapped\" by the dienophile (`7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`) in a double Diels-Alder reaction to form the stable adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Modification Steps (Steps 2 & 3)**\n\nThe subsequent two steps modify the trapped adduct. These are standard and unambiguous transformations:\n*   **Step 2:** Treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a standard acid-catalyzed deprotection that cleaves the tert-butyl ether (-OtBu) to form a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding **Product 2**.\n*   **Step 3:** Treatment with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO) is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at the bridge position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The \"Release\" and the Identity of the Final Product (Step 4)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a cascade of reactions:\n1.  **Retro-Diels-Alder Reaction:** The adduct (Product 3) fragments, reversing the initial trapping reaction. This \"releases\" two molecules of the reactive diene (*o*-quinodimethane) and one molecule of the dienophile core, which is now `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n2.  **Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` is thermally unstable and rapidly decomposes by extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**. This irreversible step drives the entire sequence to completion.\n3.  **Dimerization:** The two molecules of highly reactive *o*-quinodimethane are generated at high temperature and concentration. They cannot be isolated as monomers and will immediately react with each other. The major thermal reaction is a [4+4] cycloaddition to form a stable dimer.\n\nThe question asks for the analysis of the \"final product 4\". This must refer to a stable, isolable organic molecule. The transient *o*-quinodimethane monomer does not qualify. Therefore, **Product 4 is the stable dimer: `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`**.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Analysis of Product 4's Structure**\n\nThe final task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in `trans-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene`.\n*   **Structure and Formula:** The molecule has the formula C₁₆H₁₆. It consists of two benzene rings fused to a central, non-planar eight-membered ring.\n*   **Symmetry:** The most stable conformation of this molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis relates the two identical halves of the molecule.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** The presence of a C₂ axis means that every hydrogen atom has exactly one other hydrogen that is chemically equivalent to it. Therefore, the number of distinct hydrogen environments is half the total number of hydrogens.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 16\n    *   Number of Distinct Hydrogens = 16 / 2 = **8**\n\nThis can be confirmed by a more detailed analysis of one half of the symmetric molecule:\n*   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** The ortho-disubstituted benzene ring is attached to a rigid, chiral framework, making all four of its protons chemically distinct. This gives **4 distinct aromatic signals**.\n*   **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** The `-CH₂-CH₂-` bridge is also part of the rigid, chiral structure. The two methylene groups are in different environments, and the two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic (non-equivalent). This gives **4 distinct aliphatic signals**.\n*   **Total:** 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis number corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
