The reaction is:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:**\n    The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    We need the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, which is the dissociation constant ($K_d$). The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions formed at equilibrium.\n\n| Species       | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :------------ | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$      | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    *Note: The assumption of an \"ideal pH\" means we can consider all EDTA to be in the $Y^{4-}$ form, simplifying the calculation.*\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x:**\n    Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant ($K_d$):\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n    Since $K_d$ is extremely small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be very small compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n5.  **Final Answer:**\n    The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    This value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Dissociation Reaction:**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻, dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (EDTA⁴⁻) according to the following equilibrium reaction:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**2. Equilibrium Constants:**\nThe problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the complex, which represents the equilibrium for the forward reaction (Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻).\n*   K_f = 5.0 x 10¹⁰\n\nTo analyze the dissociation, we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n*   K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant is:\n*   K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\n**3. Equilibrium Calculation:**\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ that dissociates.\n\n| Species        | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_d expression:\n*   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n**4. Solving for x:**\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small. This means the complex is very stable and will dissociate very little. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n*   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺:\n*   x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n*   x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n*   x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n*   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.\n2.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant (K_f) for Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca-EDTA]^2-, which is K_f = 5x10^10. The reaction we are interested in is the dissociation, so we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant: K_d = 1 / K_f.\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that form at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]^2- complex will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus 'x'.\n    *   [Ca-EDTA]^2- = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca^2+] = x\n    *   [EDTA^4-] = x\n4.  **Write the K_d Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is K_d = ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]. Substituting the terms from the ICE table, we get K_d = (x * x) / (0.02 - x).\n5.  **Simplify and Solve:** Since the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d will be very small. This implies that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. The equation simplifies to K_d ≈ x^2 / 0.02.\n6.  **Calculate 'x':** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n7.  **Compare with Options:** Match the calculated value of 'x' with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values\ninitial_conc_complex = 0.02  # M\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\n\n# The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n# The equilibrium reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# The equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# Let x be the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n# From the stoichiometry, [EDTA^4-] will also be x.\n# The equilibrium concentration of the complex will be (initial_conc_complex - x).\n# The expression for K_d is: K_d = ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]\n# K_d = (x * x) / (initial_conc_complex - x)\n\n# Since K_f is very large, K_d is very small, meaning x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n# We can simplify the equation by approximating (initial_conc_complex - x) ≈ initial_conc_complex.\n# So, K_d ≈ x^2 / initial_conc_complex\n\n# Now, we solve for x:\n# x^2 ≈ K_d * initial_conc_complex\nx_squared = K_d * initial_conc_complex\n\n# x is the square root of x_squared\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of calcium ions is x.\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of calcium ions [Ca^2+] is: {x:.2e} M\")\n\n# The provided options are:\n# A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n# B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n# C) 6.3x10^-7 M\n# D) 5.0x10^-3 M\n# The calculated value 6.32e-07 M matches option C.\nprint(\"The correct option is C.\")\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as CaY²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The formation reaction is: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻. The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, Kf, given as KCa-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n*   Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, we need to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\n\n*   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf).\n*   Kd = 1 / Kf\n*   Kd = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table**\n\n*   An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table helps track the concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n*   **Reaction:**      CaY²⁻   ⇌   Ca²⁺   +   Y⁴⁻\n*   **Initial (I):**    0.02 M        0 M        0 M\n    *   We start with 0.02 M of the stoichiometric complex and assume no free ions are present initially.\n*   **Change (C):**      -x           +x         +x\n    *   For every mole of CaY²⁻ that dissociates, one mole of Ca²⁺ and one mole of Y⁴⁻ are formed.\n*   **Equilibrium (E):** (0.02 - x) M    x M        x M\n    *   The equilibrium concentrations are the sum of the initial and change rows.\n\n**4. Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\n\n*   The equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n    Kd = [Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻] / [CaY²⁻]\n*   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The formation constant (Kf) is very large, which means the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the math significantly.\n*   The simplified equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**6.

The complex is formed by the reaction of a calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) with an EDTA anion ($EDTA^{4-}$). The equilibrium for the formation is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is given as:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Consider the Dissociation:** We are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex will dissociate slightly to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium.

This means the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction, and the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}}$\n\n    The calculation was performed using the Python script, which yielded:\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for this reaction is given as 5x10¹⁰.\n\nThe problem involves the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), sometimes called the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table (ICE table) to find the concentration of the dissociated ions.

This allows for a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx ≈ √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated concentration of calcium ions matches option A.

We are given the initial stoichiometric concentration of this complex and its formation constant (K_f). We need to find the equilibrium concentration of the free calcium ions (Ca^2+). A high formation constant indicates that the complex is very stable and does not dissociate much. However, a small amount will dissociate to establish an equilibrium.\n\n**Step 2: Write the Relevant Chemical Equation**\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by:\nCa^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA^2-\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is:\nK_f = [Ca-EDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\nSince we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the dissociated ions, it's more intuitive to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\nCa-EDTA^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n**Step 3: Set up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n\n| Species       | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Ca-EDTA^2-    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA^4-       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**Careful Point:** We assume that initially, there are no free Ca^2+ or EDTA^4- ions, only the complex. The stoichiometry is 1:1:1, so if 'x' moles/L of the complex dissociate, 'x' moles/L of Ca^2+ and 'x' moles/L of EDTA^4- are formed.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Equilibrium Constant Expression**\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant (K_f) expression:\n\nK_f = [Ca-EDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-])\n5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n**Step 5: Simplify and Solve for x**\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10 >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n\n**Careful Point:** This assumption allows us to simplify the calculation. We can assume that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. We should always verify this assumption after finding 'x'.\n\nThe simplified equation is:\n5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\nx^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-2) / (5 x 10^10)\nx^2 ≈ 0.4 x 10^-12\nx^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n\nTo find x, we take the square root:\nx = √(4 x 10^-13)\nx = √(40 x 10^-14)  *(This manipulation makes the exponent even and easier to root)*\nx = (√40) x 10^-7\nSince √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer and Verification**\nThe value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n[Ca^2+] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M\n\nLet's check our assumption: Is x (6.3 x 10^-7) much smaller than 0.02? Yes, it is several orders of magnitude smaller, so our simplification was valid.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 1.0x10^-2 M\nC) 2.0x10^-2 M\nD) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nOur calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical system:** We are given a solution of a calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex is stable but exists in a dynamic equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The goal is to find the concentration of the free calcium ions at equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Write the relevant chemical reaction:** We start with the complex, so the most direct reaction to consider is its dissociation:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$, also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction. Therefore, its equilibrium constant, the dissociation constant ($K_d$), is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** This table helps track the concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no initial free calcium or EDTA. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species             | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation and substitute the values:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n6.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** The formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, which means the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is extremely small. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the assumption that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n7.  **Solve the simplified equation for x:**\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n8.  **Final conclusion:** The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves the equilibrium of a calcium-EDTA complex in solution. The formation of this complex is represented by the following reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this formation reaction ($K_f$), also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$, is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe start with a solution containing 0.02 M of the complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex will dissociate slightly back into its constituent ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nOur goal is to find the equilibrium concentration of the free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n**2. Set Up an ICE Table**\n\nTo determine the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume zero initial concentration for the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms at equilibrium. From the stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentration of $EDTA^{4-}$ will also be 'x'.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\nThe problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which means we can assume the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10.2) so that all uncomplexed EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form ($EDTA^{4-}$). This allows us to use the given formation constant $K_f$ directly without any adjustments for pH.\n\n**3. Apply the Equilibrium Constant Expression**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant expression:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**4. Solve for x**\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complexed form, and very little dissociation will occur. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n\nWe can make a simplifying approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\nNow, take the square root to find x:\n$x = \\sqrt{0.4 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nSince we defined 'x' as the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, we have $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n**5.

This complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and the EDTA ligand ($Y^{4-}$). The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium. We assume an \"ideal pH,\" which means the EDTA is fully deprotonated to $Y^{4-}$, and we don't need to consider any side reactions involving protons.\n\n2.  **Write the Equilibrium Reaction:** The formation of the complex is given by:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction ($K_f$) is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Since we start with the complex and want to find how much of it dissociates, it is helpful to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. According to the stoichiometry, for every mole of $CaY^{2-}$ that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $Y^{4-}$ are formed. We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant ($K_f$) expression:\n\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x (the concentration of Ca²⁺):** The value of $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    We can make a simplifying approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n6.  **Final Result:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Check the Answer against Options:**\n    A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.

The problem involves the dissociation of a stable complex, Ca-EDTA.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which is for the forward reaction (Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻).\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Set up the equilibrium concentrations:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n    *   [[CaY]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Substitute into the equilibrium expression:**\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** Because the formation constant is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).

The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large (5x10¹⁰), the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be significantly smaller than 0.02 M. This allows for the simplification:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n*   **Initial concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n\n*   **Change in concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] decreases by x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] increases by x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] increases by x\n\n*   **Equilibrium concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\nThe problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which implies we can use the absolute formation constant without correcting for the protonation of EDTA. This simplifies the calculation as we don't need to consider the different protonated forms of EDTA (H₄Y, H₃Y⁻, etc.).\n\n### 3. Apply the Formation Constant\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n### 4. Simplify and Solve for x\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large (5 x 10¹⁰ >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the dissociation of the complex is very small. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows us to make a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for x²:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root to find x:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions, we need to analyze the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Write the dissociation reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The reaction is:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n2.  **Use the formation constant (K_f) to find the dissociation constant (K_d):** The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = 1 / K_f$\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x'. This means the equilibrium concentrations of $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$ will both be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will be `0.02 - x`.\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for K_d:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** Since the formation constant is very large, the complex is very stable, meaning very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than 0.02. We can approximate `(0.02 - x)` as `0.02`. This simplifies the equation to:\n    $K_d \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    We can then rearrange this to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nK_formation = 5e10  # Formation constant K_f\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the dissociation constant (K_d)\nK_dissociation = 1 / K_formation\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Set up and solve the simplified equilibrium expression.\n# K_d = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)\n# Since K_f is very large, K_d is very small, so x << initial_conc.\n# We can approximate (initial_conc - x) as initial_conc.\n# K_d ≈ x^2 / initial_conc\n# x^2 ≈ K_d * initial_conc\n# x = sqrt(K_d * initial_conc)\n# x represents the concentration of Ca2+ ions at equilibrium.\n\n# Calculate x^2\nx_squared = K_dissociation * initial_complex_conc\n\n# Calculate x\nca_ion_conc = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result and the choices\nprint(f\"The dissociation constant (Kd) is: {K_dissociation:.2e} M\")\nprint(f\"The initial concentration of the complex is: {initial_complex_conc} M\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium concentration of Calcium ions ([Ca2+]) is calculated to be: {ca_ion_conc:.2e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 36\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as [Ca(EDTA)]^2- or [CaY]^2- (where Y^4- represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ion). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca^2+) and EDTA (Y^4-). The relevant chemical reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    [CaY]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant:** The question provides the formation constant (K_f) for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA = 5.0 x 10^10. The reaction for formation is the reverse of our dissociation reaction:\n    Ca^2+ + Y^4- <=> [CaY]^2- , with K_f = [CaY]^2- / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-])\n\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10^10) = 2.0 x 10^-11\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species. The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M. We assume the initial concentrations of the dissociated ions are zero. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species         | [CaY]^2-  | Ca^2+ | Y^4-  |\n|-----------------|-----------|-------|-------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M    | 0 M   | 0 M   |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x        | +x    | +x    |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x  | x     | x     |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:** Now, we use the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, with the equilibrium concentrations from the table:\n    K_d = ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) / [CaY]^2-\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Solve for x (the concentration of Ca^2+):** The value of K_d (2.0 x 10^-11) is extremely small. This indicates that the dissociation reaction proceeds to a very small extent, meaning 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make a simplifying assumption:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now, substitute this approximation back into the equation:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\n    Solve for x^2:\n    x^2 ≈ (2.0 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ 4.0 x 10^-13\n\n    Solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = sqrt(4.0 x 10^-13)\n    x = sqrt(40 x 10^-14)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n6.  **Verify the assumption:** We check if 'x' is indeed negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    6.32 x 10^-7 is much, much smaller than 0.02, so our simplifying assumption was valid.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], at equilibrium is equal to 'x'.\n    [Ca^2+] ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Formation vs. Dissociation:** Be clear about which reaction is occurring. Since we start with the complex, the relevant process is dissociation, and you must use the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f).\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The dissociation of one mole of the complex produces one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA. This 1:1:1 stoichiometry simplifies the ICE table.\n*   **Ideal pH:** The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". This is a key condition. The formation constant K_f = 5.0 x 10^10 is the absolute constant, which is only applicable when EDTA is fully deprotonated (as Y^4-). This occurs at high pH (typically pH > 10). The \"ideal pH\" assumption allows us to use this K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of the EDTA ligand.\n*   **Approximation:** The simplifying assumption (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is valid because the equilibrium constant is very small. Always mentally check if the calculated 'x' is less than 5% of the initial concentration to confirm the assumption's validity. In this case, it is much less.\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the EDTA ion) dissociates into its constituent ions. The reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    Dissociation Reaction: [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant, K_f (or K_Ca-EDTA) = 5 x 10¹⁰.

This means the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n\nWe can use a short python script for precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\ninitial_concentration = 0.02\nKf = 5e10\n\n# From the simplified equilibrium expression: Kf ≈ initial_concentration / x^2\n# We solve for x, where x = [Ca2+]\n# x^2 ≈ initial_concentration / Kf\nx = math.sqrt(initial_concentration / Kf)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis calculated value for the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 6.32e-07\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$) is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$.

Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kd expression:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (Kf) is very large, the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This implies that the complex will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).

Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be its initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n    *   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n    Because the formation constant is very large (K_f >> 1), the complex is very stable, and the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). We can simplify the equation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearrange to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

    "Based on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step solution to the problem, including key points to consider for accuracy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem starts with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and the EDTA ligand (EDTA⁴⁻). Since we are looking for the concentration of free calcium ions, the relevant reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Choose the Correct Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the **formation constant** (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which is for the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    We can work directly with this expression.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table helps track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium.\n    *   **Initial:** [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M, [Ca²⁺] = 0 M, [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:** [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ decreases by 'x', while [Ca²⁺] and [EDTA⁴⁻] each increase by 'x'.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 - x, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the formation constant (K_f):\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / ((x)(x))\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve for 'x':** The formation constant (K_f) is extremely large (5 x 10¹⁰), which signifies that the complex is very stable and will dissociate very little. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows for a key simplification:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equilibrium expression becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺]:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²  or  4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately **6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M**. This value matches option C from the question.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Formation vs. Dissociation:** You can solve this problem using either the formation constant (K_f) or the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f = 2 x 10⁻¹¹). Both methods will give the same answer if the equilibrium expression is set up correctly for the respective constant.\n*   **The \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a crucial simplifying condition. The stability of the Ca-EDTA complex is highly dependent on pH because the free EDTA ligand can be protonated. An \"ideal pH\" implies the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) that essentially all free EDTA is in the fully deprotonated EDTA⁴⁻ form. This allows the direct use of the given absolute formation constant (K_f) without needing to calculate a pH-dependent conditional constant (K'f).\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The simplification that `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` is valid because K_f is very large. The calculated result (x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷) is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02, confirming that the approximation introduces negligible error.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Solving for x:**\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small. This means the complex is very stable and will dissociate very little. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n*   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺:\n*   x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n*   x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n*   x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n*   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.\n2.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant (K_f) for Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca-EDTA]^2-, which is K_f = 5x10^10. The reaction we are interested in is the dissociation, so we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant: K_d = 1 / K_f.\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that form at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]^2- complex will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus 'x'.\n    *   [Ca-EDTA]^2- = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca^2+] = x\n    *   [EDTA^4-] = x\n4.  **Write the K_d Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is K_d = ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]. Substituting the terms from the ICE table, we get K_d = (x * x) / (0.02 - x).\n5.  **Simplify and Solve:** Since the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d will be very small. This implies that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

The equilibrium reaction for this dissociation is:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant ($K_f$):** We are given the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations.

This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nWe can now solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻²) / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\nx = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nLet 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'.

Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows for a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

However, a small amount will dissociate to establish an equilibrium.\n\n**Step 2: Write the Relevant Chemical Equation**\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by:\nCa^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA^2-\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is:\nK_f = [Ca-EDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\nSince we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the dissociated ions, it's more intuitive to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\nCa-EDTA^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n**Step 3: Set up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n\n| Species       | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Ca-EDTA^2-    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA^4-       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**Careful Point:** We assume that initially, there are no free Ca^2+ or EDTA^4- ions, only the complex. The stoichiometry is 1:1:1, so if 'x' moles/L of the complex dissociate, 'x' moles/L of Ca^2+ and 'x' moles/L of EDTA^4- are formed.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Equilibrium Constant Expression**\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant (K_f) expression:\n\nK_f = [Ca-EDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-])\n5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n**Step 5: Simplify and Solve for x**\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10 >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n\n**Careful Point:** This assumption allows us to simplify the calculation. We can assume that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. We should always verify this assumption after finding 'x'.\n\nThe simplified equation is:\n5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\nx^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-2) / (5 x 10^10)\nx^2 ≈ 0.4 x 10^-12\nx^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n\nTo find x, we take the square root:\nx = √(4 x 10^-13)\nx = √(40 x 10^-14)  *(This manipulation makes the exponent even and easier to root)*\nx = (√40) x 10^-7\nSince √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer and Verification**\nThe value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n[Ca^2+] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M\n\nLet's check our assumption: Is x (6.3 x 10^-7) much smaller than 0.02? Yes, it is several orders of magnitude smaller, so our simplification was valid.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 1.0x10^-2 M\nC) 2.0x10^-2 M\nD) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nOur calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical system:** We are given a solution of a calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex is stable but exists in a dynamic equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The goal is to find the concentration of the free calcium ions at equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Write the relevant chemical reaction:** We start with the complex, so the most direct reaction to consider is its dissociation:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$, also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction. Therefore, its equilibrium constant, the dissociation constant ($K_d$), is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** This table helps track the concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation.

This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the assumption that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n7.  **Solve the simplified equation for x:**\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n8.  **Final conclusion:** The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.

We assume an \"ideal pH,\" which means the EDTA is fully deprotonated to $Y^{4-}$, and we don't need to consider any side reactions involving protons.\n\n2.  **Write the Equilibrium Reaction:** The formation of the complex is given by:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction ($K_f$) is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Since we start with the complex and want to find how much of it dissociates, it is helpful to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. According to the stoichiometry, for every mole of $CaY^{2-}$ that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $Y^{4-}$ are formed. We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant ($K_f$) expression:\n\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x (the concentration of Ca²⁺):** The value of $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    We can make a simplifying approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n6.  **Final Result:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Check the Answer against Options:**\n    A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D. The previous Python code execution also confirmed this result (`6.32e-07 M`).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe initial calculation appears correct based on the principles of equilibrium chemistry. The problem involves the dissociation of a stable complex, Ca-EDTA.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which is for the forward reaction (Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻).\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Set up the equilibrium concentrations:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n    *   [[CaY]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Substitute into the equilibrium expression:**\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** Because the formation constant is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    *   x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    *   x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    *   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches one of the provided options. The search results confirm that this method of using the formation constant and an ICE table is the correct approach for this type of problem. The assumption of an \"ideal pH\" allows the direct use of the given formation constant (K_f) without correcting for the protonation of EDTA, which would lower the effective formation constant.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe provided information and the search results confirm the approach. The key is understanding the dissociation equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given by the expression:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant, K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe complex will slightly dissociate into its constituent ions. The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large (5x10¹⁰), the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be significantly smaller than 0.02 M. This allows for the simplification:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This result matches option B. The assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is valid, as 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is much less than 0.02.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe search results confirm the approach I used. Several sources (,,,) describe the calculation of free metal ion concentration from the dissociation of a metal-EDTA complex. They all use the formation constant (K_f) and an equilibrium calculation.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  **Write the dissociation reaction:** [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n2.  **Use the formation constant (K_f):** K_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n3.  **Set up an equilibrium expression:** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of free Ca²⁺.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n    *   [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n4.  **Substitute into the K_f expression:** K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5.  **Solve for x:** Since K_f is very large (5x10¹⁰), the dissociation is minimal, so we can approximate [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ at equilibrium to be its initial concentration, 0.02 M.\n    *   5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    *   x² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰)\n    *   x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe search results also highlight the importance of pH, stating that the given K_f values are typically for a high pH (pH > 10) where EDTA is fully deprotonated (Y⁴⁻) (,). The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which implies we should use the given K_f without correction for protonation, validating the direct calculation.\n\nThe calculation is correct. The concentration of calcium ions, x, is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of the steps and calculation:\n- Reaction: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n- K_f = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n- Equilibrium: 5x10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x²)\n- Approximation: 5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n- x² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰) = 4x10⁻¹³\n- x = √(40x10⁻¹⁴) = 6.32x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculation is sound. The answer is B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex in solution.\n\nThe formation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are starting with a solution where the stoichiometric concentration of the complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻, is 0.02 M. This complex will dissociate to some extent, establishing an equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nLet 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means the dissociation will be very small, and therefore 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the equation significantly.\n\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option B. The assumption that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02 is valid, as 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ is indeed negligible compared to 0.02.\n\nThe problem states an \"ideal pH\", which means we can use the absolute formation constant without correcting for the pH-dependent forms of EDTA.\n\nTherefore, the correct concentration of calcium ions is 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex in solution.\n\n1.  **Write the chemical equation for the dissociation.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$ (where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ion), dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$).\n    The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the given formation constant ($K_f$).**\n    The formation constant, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$ or $K_f$, is given for the formation reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    The phrase \"ideal pH\" implies that we can use this formation constant directly without needing to correct for the protonation of the free EDTA anion ($Y^{4-}$).\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.

This means that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\n    Now, take the square root to find x, which is the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{0.4 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n### 1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex from its ions is represented by the following reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe stability constant (K_f), also known as the formation constant, for this reaction is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻])\nGiven K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe problem starts with a solution of the complex, so we need to consider its dissociation:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n### 2. Set Up the Equilibrium Calculation\n\nWe start with a stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n*   **Initial concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n\n*   **Change in concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] decreases by x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] increases by x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] increases by x\n\n*   **Equilibrium concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\nThe problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which implies we can use the absolute formation constant without correcting for the protonation of EDTA. This simplifies the calculation as we don't need to consider the different protonated forms of EDTA (H₄Y, H₃Y⁻, etc.).\n\n### 3. Apply the Formation Constant\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n### 4. Simplify and Solve for x\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large (5 x 10¹⁰ >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the dissociation of the complex is very small. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows us to make a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for x²:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root to find x:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than 0.02. We can approximate `(0.02 - x)` as `0.02`. This simplifies the equation to:\n    $K_d \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    We can then rearrange this to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nK_formation = 5e10  # Formation constant K_f\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the dissociation constant (K_d)\nK_dissociation = 1 / K_formation\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Set up and solve the simplified equilibrium expression.\n# K_d = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)\n# Since K_f is very large, K_d is very small, so x << initial_conc.\n# We can approximate (initial_conc - x) as initial_conc.\n# K_d ≈ x^2 / initial_conc\n# x^2 ≈ K_d * initial_conc\n# x = sqrt(K_d * initial_conc)\n# x represents the concentration of Ca2+ ions at equilibrium.\n\n# Calculate x^2\nx_squared = K_dissociation * initial_complex_conc\n\n# Calculate x\nca_ion_conc = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result and the choices\nprint(f\"The dissociation constant (Kd) is: {K_dissociation:.2e} M\")\nprint(f\"The initial concentration of the complex is: {initial_complex_conc} M\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium concentration of Calcium ions ([Ca2+]) is calculated to be: {ca_ion_conc:.2e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 36\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as [Ca(EDTA)]^2- or [CaY]^2- (where Y^4- represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ion). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca^2+) and EDTA (Y^4-). The relevant chemical reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    [CaY]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant:** The question provides the formation constant (K_f) for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA = 5.0 x 10^10.

This indicates that the dissociation reaction proceeds to a very small extent, meaning 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make a simplifying assumption:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now, substitute this approximation back into the equation:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\n    Solve for x^2:\n    x^2 ≈ (2.0 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ 4.0 x 10^-13\n\n    Solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = sqrt(4.0 x 10^-13)\n    x = sqrt(40 x 10^-14)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n6.  **Verify the assumption:** We check if 'x' is indeed negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    6.32 x 10^-7 is much, much smaller than 0.02, so our simplifying assumption was valid.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], at equilibrium is equal to 'x'.\n    [Ca^2+] ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Formation vs. Dissociation:** Be clear about which reaction is occurring. Since we start with the complex, the relevant process is dissociation, and you must use the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f).\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The dissociation of one mole of the complex produces one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA. This 1:1:1 stoichiometry simplifies the ICE table.\n*   **Ideal pH:** The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". This is a key condition. The formation constant K_f = 5.0 x 10^10 is the absolute constant, which is only applicable when EDTA is fully deprotonated (as Y^4-). This occurs at high pH (typically pH > 10). The \"ideal pH\" assumption allows us to use this K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of the EDTA ligand.\n*   **Approximation:** The simplifying assumption (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is valid because the equilibrium constant is very small. Always mentally check if the calculated 'x' is less than 5% of the initial concentration to confirm the assumption's validity. In this case, it is much less.\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the EDTA ion) dissociates into its constituent ions.

Since we start with the complex, we should consider its dissociation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Dissociation Constant (K_d):** The problem provides the formation constant, K_f (also noted as K_Ca-EDTA), which is 5x10¹⁰.

Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can assume that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x = 2x10⁻⁶·⁵\n    To simplify, we can write 10⁻¹³ as 10 * 10⁻¹⁴:\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 is 6 and √49 is 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to 'x'.

This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution of calcium-EDTA complex, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant for Ca-EDTA, Kf = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The temperature is 25 °C and the pH is assumed to be ideal, meaning the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to bind with calcium.\n\n**1. Dissociation Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe dissociation is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (Kd) is the reciprocal of the formation constant (Kf):\nKd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**2. Setting up the Equilibrium Expression:**\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant (Kd) is:\nKd = \\[[Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\n**3. Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kd expression:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (Kf) is very large, the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This implies that the complex will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nSolve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx ≈ √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe question asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which results from the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), also known as the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of Ca²⁺. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation. The initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large (and thus the dissociation constant is very small), the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nTo solve for x, we can rewrite 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴ to make the exponent an even number:\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B. The problem assumes an ideal pH, which means we can use the given formation constant directly without adjusting for the protonation of EDTA.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe search results confirm my initial approach.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the problem:\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex into calcium ions and EDTA ions.\n    Ca-EDTA <=> Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA = 0.02 M\n    *   Formation constant (K_f) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Define the equilibrium expression:** The formation constant, K_f, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.\n    K_f = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\n4.  **Set up an equilibrium table (ICE table):** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be its initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n    *   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n    Because the formation constant is very large (K_f >> 1), the complex is very stable, and the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). We can simplify the equation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearrange to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe problem mentions an \"ideal pH\". The stability of the metal-EDTA complex is pH-dependent. The given formation constant K_f uses the concentration of the fully deprotonated EDTA⁴⁻. An \"ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) for almost all free EDTA to be in the Y⁴⁻ form, so we can use the given K_f value directly without needing a conditional constant (K'_f).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
