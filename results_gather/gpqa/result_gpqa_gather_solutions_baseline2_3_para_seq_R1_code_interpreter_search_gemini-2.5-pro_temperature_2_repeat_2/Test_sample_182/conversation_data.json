The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a count of the rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. Let's identify each source of unsaturation in the reactant:\n*   **Cyclohexene Ring:** The molecule has one six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD. The `'-3-ene'` suffix indicates a C=C double bond within this ring, which contributes another **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Functional Groups:**\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO), an aldehyde, also has a C=O double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) has a C=C double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these up, the IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **5**. All candidate answers correctly calculated this value for the reactant.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is universally known as one of the most powerful and exhaustive reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its effect is to reduce all reducible groups to their corresponding saturated alkane form.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (like C=C) to single bonds.\n*   It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely, removing the oxygen atoms and converting the functional groups to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Crucially, the stable carbon ring structure itself is not broken by this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation except for the ring.\n*   The four pi bonds (two C=C and two C=O) are all reduced to single bonds.\n*   The only feature contributing to hydrogen deficiency that remains is the six-membered ring.\nThe product is a fully saturated substituted cyclohexane. To calculate its IHD:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the ring is preserved)\n*   **Number of π bonds:** 0 (all double bonds have been reduced)\nThe IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThere is a unanimous consensus across all provided candidate answers that the chemical reasoning leads to a final IHD of 1. The reaction with Red P and HI reduces all pi bonds but preserves the ring structure. The initial IHD of 5 (1 ring + 4 pi bonds) is reduced to a final IHD of 1 (1 ring + 0 pi bonds).\n\nMatching this calculated value to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohex-` structure indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four π bonds**:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` indicates a C=C double bond within the ring, contributing **1**.\n    2.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **1**.\n    3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **1**.\n    4.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond, contributing **1**.\n\nThe IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**. This is a common distractor, as \"5\" is one of the options (Option B).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As correctly identified by all candidate answers, this is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce the molecule completely to its corresponding saturated alkane.\n\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkyl groups (-CH₃). The oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the stable carbon ring structure.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product\nThe reaction eliminates all sources of unsaturation except for the ring itself. All four pi bonds (one from the ring alkene, one from the vinyl group, one from the formyl group, and one from the carboxylic acid) are reduced to single bonds.\n\n*   **Number of Rings**: The single six-membered ring remains intact. Therefore, the number of rings in the product is **1**.\n*   **Number of Pi Bonds**: The reaction saturates the entire molecule, so there are no pi bonds left. The number of pi bonds is **0**.\n\nThe IHD of the final product is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds.\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\nThe reasoning across all provided candidate answers is unanimous: the powerful reducing agent (Red P + HI) reduces all four pi bonds but preserves the single ring, leading to a final Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated IHD of **1** corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. Let's break down the structure of the reactant:\n*   **`cyclohex`**: There is one six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: There is one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde functional group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the IHD of the starting material: 1 (ring) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) = **5**. All candidate answers that perform this calculation correctly arrive at this value. This value (5) corresponds to option B, but it represents the reactant, not the product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. All candidate answers correctly identify this reagent combination as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. The key effects of this reaction are:\n*   **Reduction of Multiple Bonds:** It reduces all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds in the reactant molecule will be removed.\n*   **Reduction of Functional Groups:** It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids to their corresponding hydrocarbon (alkane) parts. For example, both -CHO and -COOH are reduced to methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n*   **Preservation of the Carbon Skeleton:** The stable single bonds that form the carbon ring are not broken in this reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation (the four pi bonds) but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n*   All substituents (formyl, vinyl, carboxylic acid) become saturated alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, methyl).\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. To calculate its IHD, we count the rings and pi bonds in this final structure:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe reasoning across all provided candidate answers is sound and leads to a unanimous conclusion: the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers is due to the options being presented in a different order for each agent.\n\nBased on the question's specific option list:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a count of how many pairs of hydrogen atoms a molecule is \"missing\" compared to a saturated, acyclic alkane. It is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\nLet's break down the reactant's structure to count these features:\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde functional group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).

This is a common trap, as it represents the IHD of the reactant, not the product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Conditions**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its function is to perform an *exhaustive reduction*.\n\n*   **Effect**: It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   **Transformation**:\n    *   All C=C and C=O double bonds (all four π bonds in the molecule) will be reduced to single bonds.\n    *   The oxygen atoms in the formyl and carboxylic acid groups will be removed.\n    *   Crucially, stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form a ring are not broken by this reaction. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n**3.

It is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD of the final product:\n*   **Number of rings**: The single six-membered ring is preserved. Contribution to IHD = **1**.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: All double bonds have been reduced to single bonds. Contribution to IHD = **0**.\n\nThe total IHD of the product is 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**4.

This value (5) is present in the options and is a potential distractor, representing the IHD of the starting material, not the product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is universally recognized in organic chemistry as one of the most powerful reducing agents. It performs an exhaustive reduction, which means:\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkyl groups (-CH₃). The oxygen atoms are completely removed.\n*   Critically, this reaction is strong enough to reduce the pi bonds but does not break the stable sigma bonds that form the carbon ring.\n\n**3.

Analyze the Reactant Structure**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The first step, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is to determine all sources of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Ring:** The molecule has a `cyclohexene` core, which means there is one six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi Bonds:**\n    *   The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. This adds **+1** to the IHD.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond. This adds **+1** to the IHD.\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond. This adds **+1** to the IHD.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond. This adds **+1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these up, the IHD of the starting reactant is 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5. Option (B) in the original question corresponds to the IHD of the reactant, which is a common distractor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Conditions**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. As correctly stated in the candidate answers, its role is to reduce nearly all functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon forms.\n\n*   All C=C double bonds are reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   All C=O double bonds (in aldehydes and carboxylic acids) are also reduced completely. The oxygen atoms are removed, and the carbons become part of a saturated alkyl chain (e.g., -CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n*   Crucially, this reaction preserves the stable carbon ring skeleton. The ring itself is not broken.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product and Calculate its IHD**\nThe reaction removes all four pi bonds from the starting molecule but leaves the single ring structure intact.\n\n*   **Number of Rings in Product:** The six-membered ring remains. So, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of Pi Bonds in Product:** All four pi bonds from the reactant have been reduced to single bonds.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a count of the rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Ring:** The `cyclohex-` part indicates one six-membered ring. This contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **Pi Bonds:**\n    *   ` -3-ene`: One C=C double bond in the ring (+1 to IHD).\n    *   `formyl` group (-CHO): Contains one C=O double bond (+1 to IHD).\n    *   `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂): Contains one C=C double bond (+1 to IHD).\n    *   `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH): Contains one C=O double bond (+1 to IHD).\n*   **IHD of the Reactant:** The sum of these is 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5. All provided analyses correctly determined this. This value corresponds to option D, which is a distractor representing the IHD of the starting material, not the product.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction**\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   This combination is unanimously identified by all candidate answers as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n*   Its function is to reduce nearly all functional groups containing oxygen or multiple bonds down to a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n*   Specifically, it reduces C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds and removes the oxygen atoms.\n*   A key point, correctly identified by all analyses, is that the stable carbon ring structure is not broken during this reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\nThe reaction removes all pi bonds from the reactant but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   The C=C double bond in the ring is eliminated.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is eliminated.\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is eliminated.\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is eliminated.\nThe final product is a substituted **cyclohexane**, which is a saturated molecule (contains only single bonds) with one ring.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\nThe IHD of the final product is calculated based on its structure:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all pi bonds were reduced to single bonds).\n*   **IHD of the Product:** (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is a clear and unanimous consensus among all provided analyses that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the final product is **1**.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds. All candidate answers correctly identify the sources of unsaturation:\n\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohex` structure contributes +1 to the IHD.\n*   **Four π bonds**:\n    1.  One C=C bond in the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    2.  One C=C bond in the `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂).\n    3.  One C=O bond in the `formyl` group (-CHO).\n    4.

Many of the candidate answers correctly point out that this value (5) is likely a distractor option, representing the IHD of the starting material, not the final product.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. All candidate answers unanimously and correctly identify this combination as a powerful, exhaustive reducing agent. The key effects of this reaction are:\n\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds (all π bonds) to single bonds.\n*   It removes all oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, converting them to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts (e.g., -CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n*   The fundamental carbon ring structure is stable and is **not** broken during this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation except for the ring itself.\n*   The four π bonds identified in Step 1 are all eliminated.\n*   The single ring structure remains.\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated molecule (a substituted cyclohexane). To calculate its IHD:\n\n*   **Number of rings** = 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π bonds** = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\n\nThere is a clear and unanimous consensus across all provided candidate answers.

This value (5) is one of the options (D) and serves as a distractor representing the IHD of the starting material.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI). All candidate answers correctly identify this reagent combination as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce almost all functional groups completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n    *   It reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds.\n    *   It removes the oxygen atoms from the formyl and carboxylic acid groups.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds of the ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure and Final IHD**\n    The reaction transforms the reactant in the following ways:\n    *   All four pi bonds (two C=C and two C=O) are eliminated (reduced to single bonds).\n    *   The one ring structure is preserved.\n    The final product is a fully saturated substituted cyclohexane. To calculate its IHD:\n    *   **Number of rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all have been reduced).\n    *   **IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is a clear and unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers. They all correctly apply the principles of organic chemistry to deduce that the reaction is a complete reduction that removes all four pi bonds but preserves the single ring. Therefore, they all correctly calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product to be **1**.\n\nThe confusion in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the different answers is due to the models being presented with different, randomly ordered options.

Identify the Reactant and its Structural Features**\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), we need to count the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates there is one six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde group also contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a C=C double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nCalculating the IHD of the reactant:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n**2.  Analyze the Reaction and the Reagents**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI).\n*   This is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. All the candidate answers correctly identified this.\n*   Its function is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   Specifically, it reduces C=C and C=O double bonds. It removes all pi bonds.\n*   Critically, the stable ring structure composed of carbon-carbon single bonds is not broken by this reagent.\n\n**3.  Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\nThe reaction will transform the reactant as follows:\n*   All four pi bonds (one C=C in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group) will be reduced to single bonds.\n*   The single ring structure will remain.\n\nTo calculate the IHD of the product, we again sum the number of rings and pi bonds:\n*   **Number of rings in the product:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** 0 (all have been reduced).\n\nCalculating the IHD of the product:\nIHD_product = 1 (ring) + 0 (pi bonds) = **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**. The reasoning across all candidates is consistent and chemically sound: the powerful reducing agent (Red P + HI) saturates all four pi bonds in the reactant, but the single ring remains, resulting in a final IHD of 1.\n\nThe provided options for the question are:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated IHD of the product is 1, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All candidate answers that analyzed the reactant followed this logic correctly.\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohex-` part indicates a six-membered ring, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n*   **Four pi (π) bonds**:\n    1.  One C=C bond from the `-3-ene` in the ring.\n    2.  One C=O bond from the `carboxylic acid` group.\n    3.  One C=O bond from the `formyl` (aldehyde) group.\n    4.  One C=C bond from the `vinyl` group.\n    These four pi bonds each contribute +1 to the IHD, for a total of +4.\n\nThe total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = **5**. This value corresponds to option A, which is a common distractor designed to trap students who calculate the IHD of the starting material instead of the product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Structure**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As correctly identified by all candidate agents, this is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce a molecule completely to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkyl groups (-CH₃), removing all oxygen atoms and C=O double bonds.\n*   Crucially, this reaction preserves the stable carbon ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all four pi bonds from the starting material but leaves the single ring intact.\n*   **Number of rings in the product:** The six-membered ring remains, so the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) are reduced to single bonds, so the number of pi bonds is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the final product is the sum of its rings and pi bonds:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n\nThere is a unanimous consensus across all 15 candidate answers that the chemical reasoning leads to an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of **1** for the product.

Deconstruct the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step, agreed upon by all candidates, is to analyze the starting molecule: **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond) within the ring, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond), contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond), contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond), contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n\n**IHD of the Reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) = 5.**\nThis is a critical first step, and it is also a potential distractor, as '5' is listed as an option.\n\n**2.

Determine the Structure of the Product and its IHD**\n\nApplying the effects of the reaction to the reactant:\n*   All four π-bonds (from the ring C=C, the vinyl C=C, the formyl C=O, and the acid C=O) are reduced to single bonds.\n*   The single ring structure remains.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule, meaning it has no π-bonds. The IHD of the product is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Number of rings**: 1 (the six-membered ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π-bonds**: 0 (all double bonds were eliminated by the reduction).\n\n**IHD of the Product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and consistently leads to the conclusion that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a count of the rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. Let's identify each source of unsaturation in the reactant:\n*   **Cyclohexene Ring:** The molecule has one six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD. The `'-3-ene'` suffix indicates a C=C double bond within this ring, which contributes another **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Functional Groups:**\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO), an aldehyde, also has a C=O double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) has a C=C double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these up, the IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **5**. All candidate answers correctly calculated this value for the reactant.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohex-` structure indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four π bonds**:\n    1.

Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. Let's break down the structure of the reactant:\n*   **`cyclohex`**: There is one six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: There is one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde functional group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the IHD of the starting material: 1 (ring) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) = **5**. All candidate answers that perform this calculation correctly arrive at this value. This value (5) corresponds to option B, but it represents the reactant, not the product.\n\n**2.

This means all four pi bonds in the reactant molecule will be removed.\n*   **Reduction of Functional Groups:** It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids to their corresponding hydrocarbon (alkane) parts. For example, both -CHO and -COOH are reduced to methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n*   **Preservation of the Carbon Skeleton:** The stable single bonds that form the carbon ring are not broken in this reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation (the four pi bonds) but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n*   All substituents (formyl, vinyl, carboxylic acid) become saturated alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, methyl).\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. To calculate its IHD, we count the rings and pi bonds in this final structure:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**4.

The first step, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is to determine all sources of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Ring:** The molecule has a `cyclohexene` core, which means there is one six-membered ring.

Identify the Reactant and its Structural Features**\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), we need to count the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates there is one six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde group also contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a C=C double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nCalculating the IHD of the reactant:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n**2.  Analyze the Reaction and the Reagents**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI).\n*   This is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. All the candidate answers correctly identified this.\n*   Its function is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   Specifically, it reduces C=C and C=O double bonds. It removes all pi bonds.\n*   Critically, the stable ring structure composed of carbon-carbon single bonds is not broken by this reagent.\n\n**3.  Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\nThe reaction will transform the reactant as follows:\n*   All four pi bonds (one C=C in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group) will be reduced to single bonds.\n*   The single ring structure will remain.\n\nTo calculate the IHD of the product, we again sum the number of rings and pi bonds:\n*   **Number of rings in the product:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** 0 (all have been reduced).\n\nCalculating the IHD of the product:\nIHD_product = 1 (ring) + 0 (pi bonds) = **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**. The reasoning across all candidates is consistent and chemically sound: the powerful reducing agent (Red P + HI) saturates all four pi bonds in the reactant, but the single ring remains, resulting in a final IHD of 1.\n\nThe provided options for the question are:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated IHD of the product is 1, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All candidate answers that analyzed the reactant followed this logic correctly.\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohex-` part indicates a six-membered ring, contributing +1 to the IHD.\n*   **Four pi (π) bonds**:\n    1.  One C=C bond from the `-3-ene` in the ring.\n    2.  One C=O bond from the `carboxylic acid` group.\n    3.  One C=O bond from the `formyl` (aldehyde) group.\n    4.  One C=C bond from the `vinyl` group.\n    These four pi bonds each contribute +1 to the IHD, for a total of +4.\n\nThe total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = **5**. This value corresponds to option A, which is a common distractor designed to trap students who calculate the IHD of the starting material instead of the product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Structure**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As correctly identified by all candidate agents, this is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce a molecule completely to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkyl groups (-CH₃), removing all oxygen atoms and C=O double bonds.\n*   Crucially, this reaction preserves the stable carbon ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all four pi bonds from the starting material but leaves the single ring intact.\n*   **Number of rings in the product:** The six-membered ring remains, so the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) are reduced to single bonds, so the number of pi bonds is 0.\n\nThe IHD of the final product is the sum of its rings and pi bonds:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n\nThere is a unanimous consensus across all 15 candidate answers that the chemical reasoning leads to an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of **1** for the product. The different letter choices (A, B, C, D) selected by the agents are due to randomized option ordering in their individual prompts, but the underlying calculated numerical answer is consistently 1.\n\nMatching the correct calculated value (1) to the specific options provided in this question:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate responses.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step, agreed upon by all candidates, is to analyze the starting molecule: **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond) within the ring, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond), contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond), contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond), contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n\n**IHD of the Reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) = 5.**\nThis is a critical first step, and it is also a potential distractor, as '5' is listed as an option.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe second key step, also unanimously identified by all candidates, is to understand the effect of the reagents: **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**.\n\n*   This reagent combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n*   Its function is to reduce carbon-carbon multiple bonds (like C=C) to single bonds and to completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids to their corresponding hydrocarbon (alkane) parts.\n*   Crucially, the reaction preserves the stable carbon ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product and its IHD**\n\nApplying the effects of the reaction to the reactant:\n*   All four π-bonds (from the ring C=C, the vinyl C=C, the formyl C=O, and the acid C=O) are reduced to single bonds.\n*   The single ring structure remains.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule, meaning it has no π-bonds. The IHD of the product is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Number of rings**: 1 (the six-membered ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π-bonds**: 0 (all double bonds were eliminated by the reduction).\n\n**IHD of the Product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and consistently leads to the conclusion that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**. The IHD decreases from 5 in the reactant to 1 in the product because the four pi bonds are removed, while the single ring remains.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
