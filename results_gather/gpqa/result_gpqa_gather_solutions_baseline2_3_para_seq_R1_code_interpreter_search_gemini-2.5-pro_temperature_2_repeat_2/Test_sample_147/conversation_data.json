The relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is derived from the mass percentage formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe must test small integer values for `n` (which represents the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible element with a matching atomic mass.\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, but its chemical properties are inconsistent with the problem's other clues).\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br or Kr, but this path leads to weaker fits for the remaining clues).\n*   **n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol**. This is an exceptionally close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a very close match to the atomic mass of **Dysprosium (Dy)**, 162.5 g/mol.\n\nWhile both Sb and Dy provide excellent numerical fits, Antimony is a much more common element in such chemistry problems, and its fluoride chemistry (specifically SbF₅ being a powerful oxidizer that can react with Xenon) is a better fit for the clues regarding A1 and A3 than that of Dysprosium.\nLet's verify the Sb identification: The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is `(3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) ≈ 31.88%`. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, strongly supporting the conclusion that **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\nThe problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We know A4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony. The two primary candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We must determine which one fits the clues.\n1.  Calculate the molecular weights of the candidates:\n    *   MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n    *   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n2.  Compare these values with the provided answer ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 110-130\n    *   C) 140-160\n    *   D) 220-240\n    *   The molecular weight of **SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol)** falls perfectly within range **A) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) is close to range D, but does not fall inside it. This \"lock-and-key\" fit is a very strong indicator that A4 is intended to be SbF₃.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Identity of A4 with Remaining Clues**\n\nLet's check if A4 = SbF₃ is consistent with the reaction for forming A5:\n*   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is: `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`.\n*   This reaction perfectly satisfies the **1:1 molar ratio** given in the problem. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride, which would plausibly decompose in water as described.\n\nIf we had chosen A4=SbF₅, the well-known comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`, which has a 2:3 ratio, directly contradicting the 1:1 clue. Therefore, A4 cannot be SbF₅.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical path is clear and consistent:\n1.  The mass percentage of A2 strongly indicates Y is Antimony (Sb), and A2 is SbF₃.\n2.  The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) is the only value that perfectly fits into one of the provided ranges (160-180). This identifies A4 as SbF₃.\n3.  This identification is confirmed by the reaction stoichiometry clue (`Sb + A4` in a 1:1 ratio), which only works if A4 is SbF₃.\n\nThe substance A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), and its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which falls within the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers to arrive at a definitive conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable piece of evidence is the quantitative data provided: substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol. We can set up the equation for the mass percentage:\n\nɷF = (n × Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n × Molar Mass of F)\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for the molar mass of Y gives the relationship:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe must now test plausible integer values for n to find an element with a matching atomic mass.\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium/Argon, chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   **n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol.** This is an exceptionally close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. The calculated fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is ~31.88%, a near-perfect match to the given 31.96%.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is also a close match for Dysprosium (Dy), with an atomic mass of 162.5 g/mol.\n\nBetween the two strongest candidates (Sb and Dy), the clue that A1 and A3 can \"oxidize xenon\" strongly favors Antimony. SbF₅ is a classic, powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent known to react with xenon, whereas lanthanide fluorides are not. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4 using Stoichiometry**\n\nNow that Y is Sb, we need to identify A4. The problem provides a key reaction:\n\"By adding Y (Sb) in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe reaction is: **Sb + A4 → A5** (in a 1:1 reactant ratio).\n\nA4 must be another binary fluoride of antimony, making the most likely candidates SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n*   **Case 1: Assume A4 = SbF₅.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₅`, which is a classic comproportionation. However, the well-known balanced reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactants are in a **2:3 ratio**, which directly **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Case 2: Assume A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, perfectly matching the problem's description. The product, A5, would be a sub-fluoride (e.g., of empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as described.\n\nThis stoichiometric clue is a strong piece of evidence, pointing directly to **A4 being SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nHaving identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = Molar Mass of Sb + (3 × Molar Mass of F)\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = 121.76 g/mol + (3 × 19.00 g/mol)\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated value to the provided answer ranges. (Note: The letter labels for the ranges vary across the candidate answers, so we will match based on the numerical values.)\n*   A) 160-180\n*   B) 220-240\n*   C) 110-130\n*   D) 140-160\n\nThe molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls perfectly within the range of **160-180**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the information and correcting the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Identify Element Y from Mass Percentage**\n\n*   **The Clue**: Substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%.\n*   **Analysis**: Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol. We can set up the equation for the mass percentage:\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n*   **Calculation**: Rearranging the equation to solve for the atomic mass of Y, `M(Y)`, gives the relationship: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`.\n*   **Testing Candidates**: We test integer values for `n`:\n    *   For n=3, `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol`. This is an exceptionally close match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   To verify, the theoretical fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is `(3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) ≈ 31.88%`. This is a very strong match to the given 31.96%.\n*   **Conclusion**: Element Y is Antimony (Sb), and substance A2 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n**2. Identify Substance A4 from Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\n*   **The Clue**: A5 is formed by reacting element Y (Sb) and substance A4 in a **1:1 molar ratio**. The reaction is `Sb + A4 → A5`.\n*   **Analysis**: A4 is also a binary fluoride of antimony. The most common candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   **Scenario 1: A4 = SbF₅.** If A4 were antimony pentafluoride, the reaction would be `Sb + SbF₅`. This is a classic comproportionation reaction. However, the balanced chemical equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of the reactants is 2:3, which directly **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Scenario 2: A4 = SbF₃.** If A4 were antimony trifluoride, the reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio**. This perfectly matches the clue. The product, A5, would be an antimony subfluoride, which fits the description of being one of the five known compounds and decomposing in water.\n*   **Conclusion**: The only identity for A4 that is consistent with the reaction stoichiometry clue is **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\n*   **Identity**: We have deduced that A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n*   **Calculation**: We can now calculate its molecular weight:\n    `MW(A4) = MW(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)`\n    `MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**`.\n\n**4. Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges**\n\n*   **The Question**: Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls.\n*   **The Options**:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 110-130\n*   **Decision**: Our calculated molecular weight for A4 is 178.76 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided information.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThis is the most critical first step. The problem provides a key piece of quantitative data: substance A2 is a binary fluoride of Y (let's denote it YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%.\n\nThe relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)), the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nRearranging to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test plausible integer values for n (representing the oxidation state of Y) to find a matching element:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, but chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Kr, Se).\n*   **n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol**. This is an exceptionally good match for the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. A quick verification shows the fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is ~31.88%, confirming this is the most likely candidate.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a good match for Dysprosium (Dy), but lanthanide chemistry is inconsistent with the clue that A1/A3 can oxidize xenon.\n\nThe evidence strongly points to **Y being Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 being Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4 using Stoichiometry**\n\nNow that we know Y is Antimony, we analyze the clue for the formation of A5:\n\"By adding Y in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes the reaction: `Sb + A4 → A5`, where the ratio of Sb to A4 is 1:1.\nA4 must be another binary fluoride of Antimony, making the most likely candidates SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n\nLet's evaluate both possibilities:\n*   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction to produce a fluoride of intermediate oxidation state (SbF₃). The well-known balanced reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of the reactants is 2:3, which **contradicts** the explicit 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. This perfectly satisfies the **1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants. The product, A5, would be a sub-fluoride (e.g., with empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as the final clue suggests.\n\nTherefore, the only identification consistent with the strict stoichiometric clue is **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nWe have confidently identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this value to the given options:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**. This creates a fully consistent solution path where all quantitative data points (mass percentage, stoichiometry, and final molecular weight range) are in perfect agreement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Clues**\nThe core task is to identify substance A4 and determine its molecular weight range. We must use a series of chemical and numerical clues:\n1.  **Quantitative Clue 1 (Most Important):** Substance A2 is a binary fluoride (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n2.  **Chemical Clue 1:** A1 and A3 are strong oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon. This points to a high-oxidation-state fluoride of element Y.\n3.  **Quantitative Clue 2:** Substance A5 is formed by reacting element Y with substance A4 in a **1:1 molar ratio**. `Y + A4 -> A5`.\n4.  **Final Goal:** Determine which of the given ranges the molecular weight of A4 falls into.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Element Y using the Primary Quantitative Clue**\nThis is the starting point for nearly all the candidate answers and is the most reliable step.\n*   Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. From the mass percentage (31.96%), we can derive a relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n): **M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n**.\n*   Testing integer values for n:\n    *   **n=3:** M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an almost perfect match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol. This is the **strongest hypothesis**.\n    *   **n=4:** M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is also a good match for **Dysprosium (Dy)**, with an atomic mass of 162.5 g/mol. This is an alternative hypothesis.\n*   The overwhelming consensus among the candidate answers (and chemical plausibility, see step 3) supports **Y = Antimony (Sb)**. Therefore, **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Competing Hypotheses and Identify A4**\nThis is the central dilemma where the various clues must be weighed.\n*   **Hypothesis A: Antimony (Y=Sb)**\n    *   The fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   The \"oxidizes xenon\" clue suggests A1/A3 is SbF₅, which is plausible chemistry.\n    *   The **1:1 molar ratio** for the reaction `Sb + A4 -> A5` must be satisfied.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₅, the reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. This is a 2:3 ratio, **contradicting** the clue.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. This **perfectly matches** the 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Therefore, the quantitative stoichiometry clue strongly points to **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n*   **Hypothesis B: Dysprosium (Y=Dy)**\n    *   This path relies on a clean explanation for the 1:1 ratio as a comproportionation: `Dy + DyF₄ -> 2DyF₂`.\n    *   This would mean A4 = DyF₄.\n    *   However, this hypothesis has a major flaw: The premise that a dysprosium fluoride can oxidize xenon is chemically very unlikely. Lanthanides are not known to form such powerful oxidizers. This contradicts the second chemical clue.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:** The Antimony hypothesis is far more robust. It is anchored by the best mass percentage match, aligns with plausible (if esoteric) chemical properties, and, most importantly, provides a candidate for A4 (SbF₃) that perfectly satisfies the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n1.  Based on the analysis, substance **A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n2.  Calculate its molecular weight:\n    MW(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n3.  Compare this result to the original options provided in the question:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n4.  The calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\nThis corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n**1. Identify the Unknown Element (Y)**\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let's denote the formula of A2 as YFₙ, the molar mass of Y as M(Y), and the molar mass of F as ~19.00 g/mol.\n\nFrom the mass percentage formula:\n`0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n\nSolving for M(Y) gives the relationship:\n`M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n\nWe test plausible integer values for n:\n*   If n=3, then M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This value is an exceptionally close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Calculating the theoretical fluorine percentage for SbF₃ gives `(3*19)/(121.76+3*19) ≈ 31.88%`. This is a very strong match.\n*   If n=4, then M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 4 = 161.8 g/mol. This is also a very close match to **Dysprosium (Dy)**, which is 162.5 g/mol.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Two Main Hypotheses (Sb vs. Dy)**\n\nWe must use the other clues to determine which element is the correct one.\n\n*   **Clue: \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\"**. This is a powerful chemical clue. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a classic example of a strong Lewis acid and fluoride acceptor that can react with and oxidize xenon. This property is not characteristic of lanthanide fluorides like those of Dysprosium. This clue strongly favors the hypothesis that **Y = Antimony (Sb)**.\n\n*   **Clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... A4, A5 can be obtained\"**. This clue describes the reaction `Y + A4 → A5`.\n    *   If Y = Sb, A4 must be a fluoride of antimony. The reaction could be interpreted as `Sb + SbF₃ → A5` (where A5 is a subfluoride). This interpretation perfectly fits the 1:1 molar ratio and identifies **A4 = SbF₃**. The alternative, a comproportionation `2Sb + 3SbF₅`, would violate the 1:1 ratio.\n    *   If Y = Dy, the reaction `Dy + DyF₄ → 2DyF₂` elegantly fits the 1:1 ratio, identifying A4 as DyF₄. However, this contradicts the \"oxidizes xenon\" clue.\n\nGiven the options, the Antimony hypothesis is more robust as it aligns with the very specific chemical property of oxidizing xenon. We proceed by concluding that **Y is Sb**.\n\n**3. Identify Substance A4 and its Molecular Weight**\n\nThe path based on Y=Sb, which best respects the problem's stoichiometry (`1:1 ratio`), leads to the conclusion that **A4 is SbF₃**. We must now calculate its molecular weight and see if it fits into one of the provided ranges.\n\n*   M(A4) = M(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n*   M(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n**4. Match the Molecular Weight with the Provided Ranges**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 178.76 g/mol. We compare this to the ranges given in the question:\n\n*   A) 140-160\n*   B) 160-180\n*   C) 220-240\n*   D) 110-130\n\nThe value 178.76 g/mol falls perfectly within the range of **160-180**. This corresponds to option B. This perfect fit provides the final confirmation of our reasoning path.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the unknown element Y using the mass percentage of A2.**\n\n*   **The Clue:** Substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n*   **The Calculation:** Let M(Y) be the molar mass of element Y and M(F) be the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    The mass percentage formula is: `ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))`\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n`\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n*   **Identify Candidates:** We test plausible integer values for n (the oxidation state):\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptional match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a very good match for **Dysprosium (Dy)**, with an atomic mass of 162.5 g/mol.\n*   **Cross-Verification:** The problem states that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a known superacid and one of the strongest Lewis acids, capable of reacting with and oxidizing xenon. The higher fluorides of Dysprosium are not known for this property. This makes Antimony a much more plausible candidate than Dysprosium.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** Element Y is **Antimony (Sb)**, and substance A2 is **SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify substance A4 using the reaction stoichiometry.**\n\n*   **The Clue:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   **The Reaction:** Since Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5` where the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**. A4 must be another binary fluoride of antimony, likely SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n*   **Evaluating Candidates for A4:**\n    *   If A4 = SbF₅, the reaction is a comproportionation: `Sb + SbF₅ -> Product`. The well-known balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of reactants is **2:3**, which contradicts the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. This perfectly fits the **1:1 molar ratio** given in the problem. The product (A5) would be a sub-fluoride (e.g., of empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as described.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** Based on the explicit stoichiometric clue, substance **A4 must be SbF₃**. Although A2 and A4 have the same chemical formula, they are differentiated in the problem context (A2 is the product of decomposition, while A4 is a reactant in solution).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\n*   **The Compound:** We have definitively identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n*   **The Calculation:**\n    M(Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n    M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n*   **Match to Options:** We now compare this value to the given ranges:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n*   The calculated value of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the chemical puzzle involves a careful, step-by-step deduction based on the provided clues, prioritizing quantitative data.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\nThe most crucial piece of information is the quantitative data about substance A2: its fluorine mass percentage (ωF) is 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of this binary compound be YFₙ. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol. The mass percentage can be expressed as:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nRearranging to solve for the atomic mass of element Y, M(Y), in terms of n (the number of fluorine atoms):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for `n` to find an element with a matching atomic mass and plausible chemistry:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Argon). Unlikely.\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, Selenium). Plausible, but less so.\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an extremely close match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a good match for **Dysprosium (Dy)**, with an atomic mass of 162.5 g/mol.\n\nThe antimony hypothesis is stronger because its chemistry aligns better with the other clues. Specifically, the problem states that compounds A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a known, powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid that reacts with xenon compounds. Lanthanide fluorides like those of Dysprosium are not known to have this property. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\nThe problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We know A4 is another binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n\nA critical clue is the reaction used to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis translates to the reaction:\n`Sb + A4 → A5` (in a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants).\n\nLet's test our two candidates for A4:\n*   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction to form a compound of intermediate oxidation state (SbF₃). The balanced chemical reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of Sb to SbF₅ is 2:3, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio**. This reaction would form a sub-fluoride (A5, with an empirical formula of Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as described.\n\nThis analysis shows that for all the quantitative clues to be consistent, **A4 must be SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\nWe have identified substance A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃). We can now calculate its molecular weight.\n*   M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n*   M(F) = 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated value to the given ranges:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y\nThis is the most critical first step, and there is a strong consensus among the provided answers. The quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\n*   Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n*   Using the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), we can derive a relationship for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n    Rearranging gives: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n*   Testing integer values for n:\n    *   For n = 3, `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol`. This value is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   The theoretical fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is `(3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3*19) ≈ 31.88%`, which is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n*   Another possibility raised by a minority of agents is Dysprosium (Dy) for n=4, but Antimony is a far more common element in this type of chemistry puzzle and the starting point for the vast majority of successful analyses.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** The element Y is Antimony (Sb), and substance A2 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Substance A4\nA4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony. The two main candidates are Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃) and Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF₅). To determine which one is A4, we calculate their molecular weights and compare them to the ranges provided in the options.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₃**\n    *   Molecular Weight = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n*   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₅**\n    *   Molecular Weight = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\n### Step 3: Match the Molecular Weight with the Provided Ranges\nNow we compare these calculated values with the options given in the question:\nA) 140-160\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\n*   The molecular weight of **SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol)** falls perfectly inside the range of **160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of **SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol)** does not fit into any of the ranges. While it is near the 220-240 range, it is not within it.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe numerical evidence provides a clear and unambiguous path. The mass percentage of A2 strongly indicates that Y is Antimony. Given this, the molecular weight of A4 can be calculated for the two most likely compounds. Only one of these compounds, SbF₃, has a molecular weight that fits perfectly into one of the provided multiple-choice ranges.\n\nThis identifies **A4 as SbF₃**, and its molecular weight is **178.76 g/mol**, which falls in the **160-180** range. This line of reasoning is the most consistent and is supported by an overwhelming majority of the candidate answers. While some descriptive clues (like the color of A1) might seem contradictory, in complex chemistry puzzles, precise numerical data is the most reliable guide.\n\nThe correct range is 160-180, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, carefully considering all clues from the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable clue is the quantitative data: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let's denote the formula of A2 as YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe mass percentage (ωF) formula is:\nωF = [n × M(F)] / [M(Y) + n × M(F)]\n\nPlugging in the given values and solving for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\nThis can be rearranged to:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe now test plausible integer values for n:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (No suitable element)\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Bromine, but the chemistry doesn't fit)\n*   **n = 3:** M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptional match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol. The theoretical ωF in SbF₃ is 31.88%, very close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n = 4:** M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is also a very good match for **Dysprosium (Dy)**, with a molar mass of 162.5 g/mol.\n\n**Step 2: Use Chemical Properties to Distinguish Between Candidates**\n\nWe have two strong candidates, Sb and Dy. A crucial clue is that \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions,\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" These compounds must be higher fluorides of Y.\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a well-known, extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, capable of reacting with xenon fluorides. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **Dysprosium (Dy):** Dysprosium is a lanthanide. Lanthanides are not known to form fluorides capable of oxidizing xenon. This represents a fundamental contradiction with the chemical properties described.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically plausible candidate for element Y is **Antimony (Sb)**. This means **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance A4 Using Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nWe need to identify A4. The problem states that A5 is formed \"by adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n*   The reaction is: **Sb + A4 → A5**\n*   The reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**.\n*   A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony, so it is most likely SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n\nLet's test both possibilities for A4:\n*   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₅`, which is a classic comproportionation. The well-established reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactants are in a **2:3 molar ratio**, which directly **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem's description. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride (e.g., with empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as the final clue suggests.\n\nBased on the explicit stoichiometric clue, we must conclude that **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have confidently identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   M(A4) = M(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\n*   M(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol\n*   M(A4) = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\nFinally, we compare this value to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most critical and reliable piece of information is the quantitative data about substance A2. We are given that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%.\n\n1.  Let the chemical formula of A2 be YFₙ, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine, M(F), is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n2.  The mass percentage formula is: `ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))`\n3.  Plugging in the known values: `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n4.  Rearranging the equation to solve for M(Y) in terms of n gives the relationship: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`.\n5.  We test small, chemically plausible integer values for n to find an element with a matching atomic mass:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, but the required chemistry is incorrect).\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Bromine, but it doesn't fit the rest of the puzzle).\n    *   **n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol**. This value is an exceptionally close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Close to Dysprosium (Dy)). While the mass fits well, Dysprosium is a lanthanide, and its chemical properties (e.g., forming a compound that oxidizes xenon) are a much less common and plausible fit for this type of problem than Antimony.\n6.  To confirm, the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is `(3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) ≈ 31.88%`. This is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Use Stoichiometry to Identify Substance A4**\n\nA second crucial piece of quantitative information is the reaction stoichiometry for the formation of A5.\n1.  The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n2.  Since Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5`, and the molar ratio of the reactants `Sb:A4` is **1:1**.\n3.  A4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony. The two most common and stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. Let's test which one fits the stoichiometry.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction. The known balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. The reactant ratio is 2:3, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. The reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem statement. The product A5 would be a sub-fluoride (e.g., with empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as the final clue states.\n4.  Therefore, by strictly following the quantitative clues, substance **A4 must be SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have definitively identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight.\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = MW(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated molecular weight to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe calculated value of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable clue is the quantitative data: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nPlugging in the known values and rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe now test small integer values for n to find an element with a matching molar mass:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine)\n*   **n = 3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium)\n\nLet's verify the antimony hypothesis. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) ≈ 31.88%. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making it a very strong identification.\n\nFurthermore, the problem states that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony's higher fluoride, SbF₅, is a well-known strong oxidant that reacts with xenon. This chemical property strongly supports the identification of Y as Sb. The alternative candidate, Dysprosium, is a lanthanide, whose fluorides are not known to oxidize xenon. Therefore, we can confidently conclude **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\nA4 is another binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We must use the clues to distinguish which one is A4.\nThe key clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nSince Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5` where the reactants are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction. However, the established reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. This has a molar ratio of 2:3, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. This reaction stoichiometry **perfectly matches** the 1:1 molar ratio given in the problem. The product, A5, would be an antimony subfluoride (empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which is unstable and would be expected to decompose in water, fitting the final clue.\n\nThis analysis leads to the conclusion that **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   MW(A4) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we match this calculated molecular weight to the given ranges:\nA) 220-240\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe value 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by carefully synthesizing the provided information and candidate solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThis is the most critical first step.

The molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n*   The mass percentage of fluorine is given by: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)).\n*   We can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y) in terms of n:\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    This gives the relationship: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n*   We test small integer values for `n` (which corresponds to a plausible oxidation state) to find an element with a matching molar mass:\n    *   For n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (79.9 g/mol), but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit the other clues well.\n    *   For **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptionally close match to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   For n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a very close match to Dysprosium (Dy), but the clue that A1/A3 can oxidize Xenon is characteristic of p-block elements in high oxidation states (like SbF₅), not lanthanides.\n*   **Verification:** The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is `(3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) ≈ 31.88%`. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making this identification very reliable.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\nNow that we know Y is Sb, we must identify A4. A4 is one of the five binary fluorides of antimony.\n\n*   The key clue is the formation of A5: *\"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"*\n*   This describes the reaction `Sb + A4 → A5` where the reactants are in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   A4 is most likely one of the two common antimony fluorides: SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n*   Let's test both possibilities against the 1:1 ratio clue:\n    *   **Case 1: A4 is SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction.

The molar ratio of the reactants is 2:3, which **contradicts** the explicit 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 is SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio**. This perfectly matches the clue. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride (e.g., with empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable in water as stated.\n\nBased on the explicit stoichiometry provided, the most logical conclusion is that **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nWe have determined that A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated molecular weight to the ranges given in the question:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180 g/mol**. This provides a consistent \"lock-and-key\" fit, confirming our logical path. While some descriptive clues like the color of A1 might seem contradictory, in complex puzzles like this, the quantitative clues (mass percentage, stoichiometry, and final answer options) are the most reliable guides.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\n*   **Primary Clue**: Substance A2 is a binary fluoride (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n*   **Calculation**: The relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)), the molar mass of F (~19.00 g/mol), and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is given by `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n`.\n*   **Hypothesis Testing**:\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptional match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol. A check shows the fluorine mass % in SbF₃ is 31.88%, very close to the given value.\n    *   For n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This matches Dysprosium (Dy), but the later chemical clues make this less likely.\n*   **Supporting Clue**: The problem mentions that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a famous, powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid known to react with xenon. This strongly supports the identification of Y as Antimony.\n*   **Conclusion**: Element **Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and substance **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\n*   **Primary Clue**: A5 is formed by adding Y (Antimony) to a solution of A4 in a **1:1 molar ratio**. The reaction is `Sb + A4 → A5`.\n*   **Candidates for A4**: As A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony, the main candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n*   **Stoichiometry Check**:\n    *   If A4 = SbF₅, the reaction would be a comproportionation to form SbF₃. The balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This is a 2:3 molar ratio, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given.\n    *   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. This reaction perfectly matches the **1:1 molar ratio** of reactants. The product, A5, would be an antimony subfluoride.\n*   **Conclusion**: Based on the strict stoichiometric clue, **A4 must be SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\n*   We have confidently identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Molar Mass of Sb = 121.76 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of 3 × F = 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 57.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₃) = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n*   **Matching**: We now compare this value to the given ranges:\n    *   A) 220-240\n    *   B) 160-180\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 140-160\n*   The calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls perfectly within the range of **160-180 g/mol**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe logical path, relying on the strongest numerical and chemical clues (mass percentage, xenon oxidation, and reaction stoichiometry), leads to the identification of A4 as SbF₃. Its molecular weight of ~179 g/mol corresponds to the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a careful, step-by-step analysis, prioritizing quantitative clues over qualitative ones when contradictions arise.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2, a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote its formula as YFₙ), has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nUsing the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), we can establish a relationship for the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)):\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n\nSolving for M(Y) in terms of n, we get:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test plausible integer values for n (representing the oxidation state):\n*   For n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but its chemistry does not fit).\n*   For n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol. The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, a very close fit.\n*   For n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a good match for Dysprosium (Dy). However, the clue that a fluoride of Y can oxidize xenon strongly points away from a lanthanide like Dy and towards a p-block element in a high oxidation state.\n\nBased on the strong mass percentage match and supporting chemical properties (SbF₅ is a known powerful oxidant), we can confidently identify **Y as Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 as SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4 using Stoichiometry**\n\nThe next key clue is the formation of A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes the reaction: `Y + A4 → A5`, where the molar ratio of Y:A4 is 1:1.\nSince Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 → A5`. A4 must be another binary fluoride of antimony, likely SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: A4 is SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction. However, the well-established balanced reaction is `2 Sb + 3 SbF₅ → 5 SbF₃`. The molar ratio is 2:3, which directly **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: A4 is SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a perfect **1:1 molar ratio**. This exactly matches the stoichiometric clue. The product A5 would be a subfluoride (e.g., of empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly decompose in water as described.\n\nTherefore, the only hypothesis that fits the problem's strict stoichiometric requirement is that **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n\nMW(A4) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\nMW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\nFinally, we compare this value to the provided ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is derived from the mass percentage formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe must test small integer values for `n` (which represents the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible element with a matching atomic mass.\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, but its chemical properties are inconsistent with the problem's other clues).\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br or Kr, but this path leads to weaker fits for the remaining clues).\n*   **n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol**. This is an exceptionally close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a very close match to the atomic mass of **Dysprosium (Dy)**, 162.5 g/mol.\n\nWhile both Sb and Dy provide excellent numerical fits, Antimony is a much more common element in such chemistry problems, and its fluoride chemistry (specifically SbF₅ being a powerful oxidizer that can react with Xenon) is a better fit for the clues regarding A1 and A3 than that of Dysprosium.\nLet's verify the Sb identification: The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is `(3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) ≈ 31.88%`. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, strongly supporting the conclusion that **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\nThe problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We know A4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony. The two primary candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We must determine which one fits the clues.\n1.  Calculate the molecular weights of the candidates:\n    *   MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n    *   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n2.  Compare these values with the provided answer ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 110-130\n    *   C) 140-160\n    *   D) 220-240\n    *   The molecular weight of **SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol)** falls perfectly within range **A) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) is close to range D, but does not fall inside it. This \"lock-and-key\" fit is a very strong indicator that A4 is intended to be SbF₃.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Identity of A4 with Remaining Clues**\n\nLet's check if A4 = SbF₃ is consistent with the reaction for forming A5:\n*   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is: `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`.\n*   This reaction perfectly satisfies the **1:1 molar ratio** given in the problem. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride, which would plausibly decompose in water as described.\n\nIf we had chosen A4=SbF₅, the well-known comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`, which has a 2:3 ratio, directly contradicting the 1:1 clue. Therefore, A4 cannot be SbF₅.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical path is clear and consistent:\n1.  The mass percentage of A2 strongly indicates Y is Antimony (Sb), and A2 is SbF₃.\n2.  The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) is the only value that perfectly fits into one of the provided ranges (160-180). This identifies A4 as SbF₃.\n3.  This identification is confirmed by the reaction stoichiometry clue (`Sb + A4` in a 1:1 ratio), which only works if A4 is SbF₃.\n\nThe substance A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), and its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which falls within the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers to arrive at a definitive conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable piece of evidence is the quantitative data provided: substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol. We can set up the equation for the mass percentage:\n\nɷF = (n × Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n × Molar Mass of F)\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for the molar mass of Y gives the relationship:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe must now test plausible integer values for n to find an element with a matching atomic mass.\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium/Argon, chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   **n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol.** This is an exceptionally close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. The calculated fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is ~31.88%, a near-perfect match to the given 31.96%.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is also a close match for Dysprosium (Dy), with an atomic mass of 162.5 g/mol.\n\nBetween the two strongest candidates (Sb and Dy), the clue that A1 and A3 can \"oxidize xenon\" strongly favors Antimony. SbF₅ is a classic, powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent known to react with xenon, whereas lanthanide fluorides are not. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4 using Stoichiometry**\n\nNow that Y is Sb, we need to identify A4. The problem provides a key reaction:\n\"By adding Y (Sb) in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe reaction is: **Sb + A4 → A5** (in a 1:1 reactant ratio).\n\nA4 must be another binary fluoride of antimony, making the most likely candidates SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n*   **Case 1: Assume A4 = SbF₅.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₅`, which is a classic comproportionation.

We can set up the equation for the mass percentage:\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n*   **Calculation**: Rearranging the equation to solve for the atomic mass of Y, `M(Y)`, gives the relationship: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`.\n*   **Testing Candidates**: We test integer values for `n`:\n    *   For n=3, `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol`. This is an exceptionally close match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   To verify, the theoretical fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is `(3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) ≈ 31.88%`.

However, the balanced chemical equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of the reactants is 2:3, which directly **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Scenario 2: A4 = SbF₃.** If A4 were antimony trifluoride, the reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio**. This perfectly matches the clue.

The problem provides a key piece of quantitative data: substance A2 is a binary fluoride of Y (let's denote it YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%.\n\nThe relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)), the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nRearranging to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test plausible integer values for n (representing the oxidation state of Y) to find a matching element:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, but chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Kr, Se).\n*   **n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol**. This is an exceptionally good match for the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. A quick verification shows the fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is ~31.88%, confirming this is the most likely candidate.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a good match for Dysprosium (Dy), but lanthanide chemistry is inconsistent with the clue that A1/A3 can oxidize xenon.\n\nThe evidence strongly points to **Y being Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 being Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4 using Stoichiometry**\n\nNow that we know Y is Antimony, we analyze the clue for the formation of A5:\n\"By adding Y in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes the reaction: `Sb + A4 → A5`, where the ratio of Sb to A4 is 1:1.\nA4 must be another binary fluoride of Antimony, making the most likely candidates SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n\nLet's evaluate both possibilities:\n*   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction to produce a fluoride of intermediate oxidation state (SbF₃). The well-known balanced reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of the reactants is 2:3, which **contradicts** the explicit 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. This perfectly satisfies the **1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants. The product, A5, would be a sub-fluoride (e.g., with empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as the final clue suggests.\n\nTherefore, the only identification consistent with the strict stoichiometric clue is **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nWe have confidently identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this value to the given options:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**. This creates a fully consistent solution path where all quantitative data points (mass percentage, stoichiometry, and final molecular weight range) are in perfect agreement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Clues**\nThe core task is to identify substance A4 and determine its molecular weight range. We must use a series of chemical and numerical clues:\n1.  **Quantitative Clue 1 (Most Important):** Substance A2 is a binary fluoride (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n2.  **Chemical Clue 1:** A1 and A3 are strong oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon. This points to a high-oxidation-state fluoride of element Y.\n3.  **Quantitative Clue 2:** Substance A5 is formed by reacting element Y with substance A4 in a **1:1 molar ratio**. `Y + A4 -> A5`.\n4.  **Final Goal:** Determine which of the given ranges the molecular weight of A4 falls into.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Element Y using the Primary Quantitative Clue**\nThis is the starting point for nearly all the candidate answers and is the most reliable step.\n*   Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. From the mass percentage (31.96%), we can derive a relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n): **M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n**.\n*   Testing integer values for n:\n    *   **n=3:** M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an almost perfect match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol. This is the **strongest hypothesis**.\n    *   **n=4:** M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is also a good match for **Dysprosium (Dy)**, with an atomic mass of 162.5 g/mol. This is an alternative hypothesis.\n*   The overwhelming consensus among the candidate answers (and chemical plausibility, see step 3) supports **Y = Antimony (Sb)**. Therefore, **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Competing Hypotheses and Identify A4**\nThis is the central dilemma where the various clues must be weighed.\n*   **Hypothesis A: Antimony (Y=Sb)**\n    *   The fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   The \"oxidizes xenon\" clue suggests A1/A3 is SbF₅, which is plausible chemistry.\n    *   The **1:1 molar ratio** for the reaction `Sb + A4 -> A5` must be satisfied.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₅, the reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. This is a 2:3 ratio, **contradicting** the clue.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. This **perfectly matches** the 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Therefore, the quantitative stoichiometry clue strongly points to **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n*   **Hypothesis B: Dysprosium (Y=Dy)**\n    *   This path relies on a clean explanation for the 1:1 ratio as a comproportionation: `Dy + DyF₄ -> 2DyF₂`.\n    *   This would mean A4 = DyF₄.\n    *   However, this hypothesis has a major flaw: The premise that a dysprosium fluoride can oxidize xenon is chemically very unlikely. Lanthanides are not known to form such powerful oxidizers. This contradicts the second chemical clue.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:** The Antimony hypothesis is far more robust. It is anchored by the best mass percentage match, aligns with plausible (if esoteric) chemical properties, and, most importantly, provides a candidate for A4 (SbF₃) that perfectly satisfies the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n1.  Based on the analysis, substance **A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n2.  Calculate its molecular weight:\n    MW(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n3.  Compare this result to the original options provided in the question:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n4.  The calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\nThis corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n**1. Identify the Unknown Element (Y)**\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let's denote the formula of A2 as YFₙ, the molar mass of Y as M(Y), and the molar mass of F as ~19.00 g/mol.\n\nFrom the mass percentage formula:\n`0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n\nSolving for M(Y) gives the relationship:\n`M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n\nWe test plausible integer values for n:\n*   If n=3, then M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This value is an exceptionally close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Calculating the theoretical fluorine percentage for SbF₃ gives `(3*19)/(121.76+3*19) ≈ 31.88%`. This is a very strong match.\n*   If n=4, then M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 4 = 161.8 g/mol. This is also a very close match to **Dysprosium (Dy)**, which is 162.5 g/mol.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Two Main Hypotheses (Sb vs. Dy)**\n\nWe must use the other clues to determine which element is the correct one.\n\n*   **Clue: \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\"**. This is a powerful chemical clue. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a classic example of a strong Lewis acid and fluoride acceptor that can react with and oxidize xenon. This property is not characteristic of lanthanide fluorides like those of Dysprosium. This clue strongly favors the hypothesis that **Y = Antimony (Sb)**.\n\n*   **Clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... A4, A5 can be obtained\"**. This clue describes the reaction `Y + A4 → A5`.\n    *   If Y = Sb, A4 must be a fluoride of antimony. The reaction could be interpreted as `Sb + SbF₃ → A5` (where A5 is a subfluoride). This interpretation perfectly fits the 1:1 molar ratio and identifies **A4 = SbF₃**. The alternative, a comproportionation `2Sb + 3SbF₅`, would violate the 1:1 ratio.\n    *   If Y = Dy, the reaction `Dy + DyF₄ → 2DyF₂` elegantly fits the 1:1 ratio, identifying A4 as DyF₄. However, this contradicts the \"oxidizes xenon\" clue.\n\nGiven the options, the Antimony hypothesis is more robust as it aligns with the very specific chemical property of oxidizing xenon. We proceed by concluding that **Y is Sb**.\n\n**3. Identify Substance A4 and its Molecular Weight**\n\nThe path based on Y=Sb, which best respects the problem's stoichiometry (`1:1 ratio`), leads to the conclusion that **A4 is SbF₃**. We must now calculate its molecular weight and see if it fits into one of the provided ranges.\n\n*   M(A4) = M(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n*   M(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n**4. Match the Molecular Weight with the Provided Ranges**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 178.76 g/mol. We compare this to the ranges given in the question:\n\n*   A) 140-160\n*   B) 160-180\n*   C) 220-240\n*   D) 110-130\n\nThe value 178.76 g/mol falls perfectly within the range of **160-180**. This corresponds to option B. This perfect fit provides the final confirmation of our reasoning path.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the unknown element Y using the mass percentage of A2.**\n\n*   **The Clue:** Substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n*   **The Calculation:** Let M(Y) be the molar mass of element Y and M(F) be the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    The mass percentage formula is: `ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))`\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n`\n    `0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n`\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n*   **Identify Candidates:** We test plausible integer values for n (the oxidation state):\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptional match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a very good match for **Dysprosium (Dy)**, with an atomic mass of 162.5 g/mol.\n*   **Cross-Verification:** The problem states that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a known superacid and one of the strongest Lewis acids, capable of reacting with and oxidizing xenon. The higher fluorides of Dysprosium are not known for this property. This makes Antimony a much more plausible candidate than Dysprosium.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** Element Y is **Antimony (Sb)**, and substance A2 is **SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify substance A4 using the reaction stoichiometry.**\n\n*   **The Clue:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   **The Reaction:** Since Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5` where the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**. A4 must be another binary fluoride of antimony, likely SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n*   **Evaluating Candidates for A4:**\n    *   If A4 = SbF₅, the reaction is a comproportionation: `Sb + SbF₅ -> Product`. The well-known balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of reactants is **2:3**, which contradicts the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. This perfectly fits the **1:1 molar ratio** given in the problem. The product (A5) would be a sub-fluoride (e.g., of empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as described.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** Based on the explicit stoichiometric clue, substance **A4 must be SbF₃**. Although A2 and A4 have the same chemical formula, they are differentiated in the problem context (A2 is the product of decomposition, while A4 is a reactant in solution).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\n*   **The Compound:** We have definitively identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n*   **The Calculation:**\n    M(Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n    M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n*   **Match to Options:** We now compare this value to the given ranges:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n*   The calculated value of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the chemical puzzle involves a careful, step-by-step deduction based on the provided clues, prioritizing quantitative data.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\nThe most crucial piece of information is the quantitative data about substance A2: its fluorine mass percentage (ωF) is 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of this binary compound be YFₙ. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol. The mass percentage can be expressed as:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nRearranging to solve for the atomic mass of element Y, M(Y), in terms of n (the number of fluorine atoms):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for `n` to find an element with a matching atomic mass and plausible chemistry:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Argon). Unlikely.\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, Selenium). Plausible, but less so.\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an extremely close match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a good match for **Dysprosium (Dy)**, with an atomic mass of 162.5 g/mol.\n\nThe antimony hypothesis is stronger because its chemistry aligns better with the other clues. Specifically, the problem states that compounds A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a known, powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid that reacts with xenon compounds. Lanthanide fluorides like those of Dysprosium are not known to have this property. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\nThe problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We know A4 is another binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n\nA critical clue is the reaction used to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis translates to the reaction:\n`Sb + A4 → A5` (in a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants).\n\nLet's test our two candidates for A4:\n*   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction to form a compound of intermediate oxidation state (SbF₃). The balanced chemical reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of Sb to SbF₅ is 2:3, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio**. This reaction would form a sub-fluoride (A5, with an empirical formula of Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as described.\n\nThis analysis shows that for all the quantitative clues to be consistent, **A4 must be SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\nWe have identified substance A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃). We can now calculate its molecular weight.\n*   M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n*   M(F) = 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated value to the given ranges:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y\nThis is the most critical first step, and there is a strong consensus among the provided answers. The quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\n*   Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n*   Using the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), we can derive a relationship for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n    Rearranging gives: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n*   Testing integer values for n:\n    *   For n = 3, `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol`. This value is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   The theoretical fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is `(3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3*19) ≈ 31.88%`, which is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n*   Another possibility raised by a minority of agents is Dysprosium (Dy) for n=4, but Antimony is a far more common element in this type of chemistry puzzle and the starting point for the vast majority of successful analyses.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** The element Y is Antimony (Sb), and substance A2 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Substance A4\nA4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony. The two main candidates are Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃) and Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF₅). To determine which one is A4, we calculate their molecular weights and compare them to the ranges provided in the options.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₃**\n    *   Molecular Weight = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n*   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₅**\n    *   Molecular Weight = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\n### Step 3: Match the Molecular Weight with the Provided Ranges\nNow we compare these calculated values with the options given in the question:\nA) 140-160\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\n*   The molecular weight of **SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol)** falls perfectly inside the range of **160-180**.\n*   The molecular weight of **SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol)** does not fit into any of the ranges. While it is near the 220-240 range, it is not within it.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe numerical evidence provides a clear and unambiguous path. The mass percentage of A2 strongly indicates that Y is Antimony. Given this, the molecular weight of A4 can be calculated for the two most likely compounds. Only one of these compounds, SbF₃, has a molecular weight that fits perfectly into one of the provided multiple-choice ranges.\n\nThis identifies **A4 as SbF₃**, and its molecular weight is **178.76 g/mol**, which falls in the **160-180** range. This line of reasoning is the most consistent and is supported by an overwhelming majority of the candidate answers. While some descriptive clues (like the color of A1) might seem contradictory, in complex chemistry puzzles, precise numerical data is the most reliable guide.\n\nThe correct range is 160-180, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, carefully considering all clues from the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable clue is the quantitative data: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let's denote the formula of A2 as YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe mass percentage (ωF) formula is:\nωF = [n × M(F)] / [M(Y) + n × M(F)]\n\nPlugging in the given values and solving for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\nThis can be rearranged to:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe now test plausible integer values for n:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (No suitable element)\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Bromine, but the chemistry doesn't fit)\n*   **n = 3:** M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptional match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol. The theoretical ωF in SbF₃ is 31.88%, very close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n = 4:** M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is also a very good match for **Dysprosium (Dy)**, with a molar mass of 162.5 g/mol.\n\n**Step 2: Use Chemical Properties to Distinguish Between Candidates**\n\nWe have two strong candidates, Sb and Dy. A crucial clue is that \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions,\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" These compounds must be higher fluorides of Y.\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a well-known, extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, capable of reacting with xenon fluorides. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **Dysprosium (Dy):** Dysprosium is a lanthanide. Lanthanides are not known to form fluorides capable of oxidizing xenon. This represents a fundamental contradiction with the chemical properties described.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically plausible candidate for element Y is **Antimony (Sb)**. This means **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance A4 Using Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nWe need to identify A4. The problem states that A5 is formed \"by adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n*   The reaction is: **Sb + A4 → A5**\n*   The reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**.\n*   A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony, so it is most likely SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n\nLet's test both possibilities for A4:\n*   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₅`, which is a classic comproportionation. The well-established reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactants are in a **2:3 molar ratio**, which directly **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem's description. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride (e.g., with empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as the final clue suggests.\n\nBased on the explicit stoichiometric clue, we must conclude that **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have confidently identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   M(A4) = M(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\n*   M(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol\n*   M(A4) = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\nFinally, we compare this value to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most critical and reliable piece of information is the quantitative data about substance A2. We are given that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96%.\n\n1.  Let the chemical formula of A2 be YFₙ, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine, M(F), is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n2.  The mass percentage formula is: `ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))`\n3.  Plugging in the known values: `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n4.  Rearranging the equation to solve for M(Y) in terms of n gives the relationship: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`.\n5.  We test small, chemically plausible integer values for n to find an element with a matching atomic mass:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, but the required chemistry is incorrect).\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Bromine, but it doesn't fit the rest of the puzzle).\n    *   **n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol**. This value is an exceptionally close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Close to Dysprosium (Dy)). While the mass fits well, Dysprosium is a lanthanide, and its chemical properties (e.g., forming a compound that oxidizes xenon) are a much less common and plausible fit for this type of problem than Antimony.\n6.  To confirm, the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is `(3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) ≈ 31.88%`. This is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Use Stoichiometry to Identify Substance A4**\n\nA second crucial piece of quantitative information is the reaction stoichiometry for the formation of A5.\n1.  The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n2.  Since Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5`, and the molar ratio of the reactants `Sb:A4` is **1:1**.\n3.  A4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony. The two most common and stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. Let's test which one fits the stoichiometry.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction. The known balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. The reactant ratio is 2:3, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. The reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem statement. The product A5 would be a sub-fluoride (e.g., with empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable and decompose in water as the final clue states.\n4.  Therefore, by strictly following the quantitative clues, substance **A4 must be SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have definitively identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight.\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = MW(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated molecular weight to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe calculated value of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most reliable clue is the quantitative data: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nPlugging in the known values and rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe now test small integer values for n to find an element with a matching molar mass:\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine)\n*   **n = 3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium)\n\nLet's verify the antimony hypothesis. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) ≈ 31.88%. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making it a very strong identification.\n\nFurthermore, the problem states that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony's higher fluoride, SbF₅, is a well-known strong oxidant that reacts with xenon. This chemical property strongly supports the identification of Y as Sb. The alternative candidate, Dysprosium, is a lanthanide, whose fluorides are not known to oxidize xenon. Therefore, we can confidently conclude **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\nA4 is another binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We must use the clues to distinguish which one is A4.\nThe key clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nSince Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5` where the reactants are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction. However, the established reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. This has a molar ratio of 2:3, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. This reaction stoichiometry **perfectly matches** the 1:1 molar ratio given in the problem. The product, A5, would be an antimony subfluoride (empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which is unstable and would be expected to decompose in water, fitting the final clue.\n\nThis analysis leads to the conclusion that **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   MW(A4) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we match this calculated molecular weight to the given ranges:\nA) 220-240\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe value 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by carefully synthesizing the provided information and candidate solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThis is the most critical first step. The problem provides a precise quantitative clue: substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine (F) by mass.\n\n*   Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n*   The mass percentage of fluorine is given by: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)).\n*   We can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y) in terms of n:\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    This gives the relationship: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n*   We test small integer values for `n` (which corresponds to a plausible oxidation state) to find an element with a matching molar mass:\n    *   For n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (79.9 g/mol), but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit the other clues well.\n    *   For **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptionally close match to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   For n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a very close match to Dysprosium (Dy), but the clue that A1/A3 can oxidize Xenon is characteristic of p-block elements in high oxidation states (like SbF₅), not lanthanides.\n*   **Verification:** The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is `(3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) ≈ 31.88%`. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making this identification very reliable.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\nNow that we know Y is Sb, we must identify A4. A4 is one of the five binary fluorides of antimony.\n\n*   The key clue is the formation of A5: *\"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"*\n*   This describes the reaction `Sb + A4 → A5` where the reactants are in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   A4 is most likely one of the two common antimony fluorides: SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n*   Let's test both possibilities against the 1:1 ratio clue:\n    *   **Case 1: A4 is SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction. The known, balanced reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of the reactants is 2:3, which **contradicts** the explicit 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 is SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio**. This perfectly matches the clue. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride (e.g., with empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly be unstable in water as stated.\n\nBased on the explicit stoichiometry provided, the most logical conclusion is that **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nWe have determined that A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated molecular weight to the ranges given in the question:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180 g/mol**. This provides a consistent \"lock-and-key\" fit, confirming our logical path. While some descriptive clues like the color of A1 might seem contradictory, in complex puzzles like this, the quantitative clues (mass percentage, stoichiometry, and final answer options) are the most reliable guides.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\n*   **Primary Clue**: Substance A2 is a binary fluoride (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n*   **Calculation**: The relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)), the molar mass of F (~19.00 g/mol), and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is given by `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n`.\n*   **Hypothesis Testing**:\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptional match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol. A check shows the fluorine mass % in SbF₃ is 31.88%, very close to the given value.\n    *   For n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This matches Dysprosium (Dy), but the later chemical clues make this less likely.\n*   **Supporting Clue**: The problem mentions that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a famous, powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid known to react with xenon. This strongly supports the identification of Y as Antimony.\n*   **Conclusion**: Element **Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and substance **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\n*   **Primary Clue**: A5 is formed by adding Y (Antimony) to a solution of A4 in a **1:1 molar ratio**. The reaction is `Sb + A4 → A5`.\n*   **Candidates for A4**: As A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony, the main candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n*   **Stoichiometry Check**:\n    *   If A4 = SbF₅, the reaction would be a comproportionation to form SbF₃. The balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This is a 2:3 molar ratio, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given.\n    *   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. This reaction perfectly matches the **1:1 molar ratio** of reactants. The product, A5, would be an antimony subfluoride.\n*   **Conclusion**: Based on the strict stoichiometric clue, **A4 must be SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\n*   We have confidently identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Molar Mass of Sb = 121.76 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of 3 × F = 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 57.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₃) = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n*   **Matching**: We now compare this value to the given ranges:\n    *   A) 220-240\n    *   B) 160-180\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 140-160\n*   The calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls perfectly within the range of **160-180 g/mol**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe logical path, relying on the strongest numerical and chemical clues (mass percentage, xenon oxidation, and reaction stoichiometry), leads to the identification of A4 as SbF₃. Its molecular weight of ~179 g/mol corresponds to the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a careful, step-by-step analysis, prioritizing quantitative clues over qualitative ones when contradictions arise.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**\n\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2, a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote its formula as YFₙ), has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nUsing the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), we can establish a relationship for the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)):\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n\nSolving for M(Y) in terms of n, we get:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test plausible integer values for n (representing the oxidation state):\n*   For n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but its chemistry does not fit).\n*   For n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol. The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, a very close fit.\n*   For n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is a good match for Dysprosium (Dy). However, the clue that a fluoride of Y can oxidize xenon strongly points away from a lanthanide like Dy and towards a p-block element in a high oxidation state.\n\nBased on the strong mass percentage match and supporting chemical properties (SbF₅ is a known powerful oxidant), we can confidently identify **Y as Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 as SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4 using Stoichiometry**\n\nThe next key clue is the formation of A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes the reaction: `Y + A4 → A5`, where the molar ratio of Y:A4 is 1:1.\nSince Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 → A5`. A4 must be another binary fluoride of antimony, likely SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: A4 is SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction. However, the well-established balanced reaction is `2 Sb + 3 SbF₅ → 5 SbF₃`. The molar ratio is 2:3, which directly **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: A4 is SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a perfect **1:1 molar ratio**. This exactly matches the stoichiometric clue. The product A5 would be a subfluoride (e.g., of empirical formula Sb₂F₃), which would plausibly decompose in water as described.\n\nTherefore, the only hypothesis that fits the problem's strict stoichiometric requirement is that **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n\nMW(A4) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\nMW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\nFinally, we compare this value to the provided ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
