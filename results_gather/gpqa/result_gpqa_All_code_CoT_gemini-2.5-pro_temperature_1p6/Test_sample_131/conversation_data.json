    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic spectroscopy problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the structure and symmetry of each molecule to predict its 1H NMR spectrum, and then comparing those predictions to the experimental data for the mixture.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:** First, I'll confirm that all proposed compounds (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) match the given molecular formula C10H14.\n2.  **Predict Individual Spectra:** For each of the four compounds, I will predict its 1H NMR spectrum. This involves determining the number of unique proton environments (which corresponds to the number of signals) and the relative number of protons in each environment (the integration). I will pay close attention to symmetry, as it determines which protons are chemically equivalent.\n3.  **Simulate Mixture Spectra:** For each multiple-choice option (A, B, C, D), I will simulate the combined spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of the two proposed compounds.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** I will compare the simulated spectrum for each option against the provided experimental data:\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n5.  **Identify the Correct Pair:** The option whose simulated spectrum matches the experimental data will be the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_ratio(integrations):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to calculate the simplest integer ratio from a list of integrations.\"\"\"\n    if not integrations:\n        return []\n    # Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integrations\n    common_divisor = integrations[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(integrations)):\n        common_divisor = math.gcd(common_divisor, integrations[i])\n    \n    # Divide each integration by the GCD to get the simplest ratio\n    ratio = [int(i / common_divisor) for i in integrations]\n    return sorted(ratio, reverse=True)\n\ndef analyze_mixture():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential mixtures of aromatic compounds to match a given 1H NMR spectrum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define compound structures and their predicted NMR signals\n    # Data is based on chemical structure analysis (symmetry)\n    # Format: { \"aromatic\": [integrations], \"alkyl\": [integrations], \"alkyl_multiplicity\": [\"types\"] }\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [2],\n            \"alkyl\": [12],\n            \"alkyl_multiplicity\": [\"singlet\"]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [1, 1], # Two distinct aromatic protons\n            \"alkyl\": [6, 3, 3],\n            \"alkyl_multiplicity\": [\"singlet\", \"singlet\", \"singlet\"]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [2],\n            \"alkyl\": [6, 6],\n            \"alkyl_multiplicity\": [\"singlet\", \"singlet\"]\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [4],\n            \"alkyl\": [4, 6], # CH2 and CH3 of ethyl groups\n            \"alkyl_multiplicity\": [\"quartet\", \"triplet\"] # Not singlets\n        }\n    }\n\n    # The four options provided in the problem\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"],\n        \"B\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"C\": [\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"D\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"]\n    }\n    \n    # The observed experimental data for the 1:1 mixture\n    observed_spectrum = {\n        \"aromatic_signals\": 2,\n        \"aromatic_ratio\": [1, 1],\n        \"alkyl_signals\": 3,\n        \"alkyl_ratio\": [2, 1, 1],\n        \"alkyl_multiplicity\": \"singlet\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the options based on the provided 1H NMR data...\\n\")\n\n    correct_option = None\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through options, simulate the mixture, and compare\n    for option_letter, pair in options.items():\n        comp1_name, comp2_name = pair\n        comp1 = compounds[comp1_name]\n        comp2 = compounds[comp2_name]\n        \n        print(f\"--- Checking Option {option_letter}: {comp1_name} + {comp2_name} ---\")\n\n        # Combine signals for the 1:1 mixture\n        # Aromatic signals\n        combined_aromatic_integrations = comp1[\"aromatic\"] + comp2[\"aromatic\"]\n        num_aromatic_signals = len(combined_aromatic_integrations)\n        aromatic_ratio = get_ratio(combined_aromatic_integrations)\n\n        # Alkyl signals\n        combined_alkyl_integrations = comp1[\"alkyl\"] + comp2[\"alkyl\"]\n        num_alkyl_signals = len(combined_alkyl_integrations)\n        alkyl_ratio = get_ratio(combined_alkyl_integrations)\n\n        # Check alkyl signal multiplicities (must all be singlets)\n        all_singlets = all(m == \"singlet\" for m in comp1[\"alkyl_multiplicity\"] + comp2[\"alkyl_multiplicity\"])\n        \n        # Compare with observed spectrum\n        aromatic_match = (num_aromatic_signals == observed_spectrum[\"aromatic_signals\"] and \n                          aromatic_ratio == observed_spectrum[\"aromatic_ratio\"])\n        \n        alkyl_match = (num_alkyl_signals == observed_spectrum[\"alkyl_signals\"] and \n                       alkyl_ratio == observed_spectrum[\"alkyl_ratio\"] and all_singlets)\n\n        # Print analysis for the current option\n        print(f\"Aromatic Region Analysis:\")\n        print(f\"  -
