    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: Radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n2.  **Define the Goal**: We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is the same as finding the probability that a brand new atom of the same type would decay within 150 minutes.\n3.  **Model the Decay**: The probability of an atom *not* decaying (surviving) over a time `t` can be described by an exponential function: `P_survive(t) = exp(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of decay is therefore `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - exp(-λt)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**: We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    *   `P_decay(100) = 0.32 = 1 - exp(-λ * 100)`\n    *   This means `P_survive(100) = exp(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   We don't need to explicitly solve for `λ`, we can use this survival probability directly.\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We want to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, `P_decay(150)`.\n    *   `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150)`\n    *   We know `P_survive(150) = exp(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can rewrite this using our known value: `exp(-λ * 150) = (exp(-λ * 100))^(150/100) = (P_survive(100))^1.5`.\n    *   So, `P_survive(150) = 0.68^1.5`.\n6.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   Calculate `0.68^1.5`.\n    *   Calculate the decay probability: `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68^1.5)`.\n    *   Convert the result to a percentage and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given information\n# Probability of decay within 100 minutes\nprob_decay_100 = 0.32\ntime_interval_1 = 100 # in minutes\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the probability of survival within 100 minutes\n# P_survive(t) = 1 - P_decay(t)\nprob_survival_100 = 1 - prob_decay_100\n\n# The problem asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes,\n# given it has already survived 50 minutes. Due to the memoryless nature of\n# radioactive decay, this is the same as calculating the probability of decay\n# for a new atom in a 150-minute interval.\n\n# Step 3: Define the new time interval for which we want to find the decay probability\ntime_interval_2 = 150 # in minutes\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the probability of survival for 150 minutes\n# The survival probability is P_survive(t) = exp(-lambda * t).\n# So, P_survive(100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n# And P_survive(150) = exp(-lambda * 150)\n# We can write exp(-lambda * 150) as (exp(-lambda * 100))^(150/100)\n# P_survive(150) = (P_survive(100))^(150/100)\nprob_survival_150 = prob_survival_100 ** (time_interval_2 / time_interval_1)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\n# Step 6: Convert to percentage and print the results\nprob_decay_150_percent = prob_decay_150 * 100\n\nprint(\"The given information is that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\")\nprint(\"We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\")\nprint(\"Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is: {:.2f}%\".format(prob_decay_150_percent))\nprint(\"\\nLet's compare this with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 44%\")\nprint(\"B) 48%\")\nprint(\"C) 52%\")\nprint(\"D) 40%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated probability of ~44% matches option A.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
