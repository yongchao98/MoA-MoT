    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** First, we need to find the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms in the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n    *   `(CH3)2C=` contributes 3 C and 6 H.\n    *   `=CH-` contributes 1 C and 1 H.\n    *   `-CH2-` contributes 1 C and 2 H.\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-` contributes 2 C and 4 H.\n    *   `-CH2-` contributes 1 C and 2 H.\n    *   `-CH=` contributes 1 C and 1 H.\n    *   `=C(CH3)2` contributes 3 C and 6 H.\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₂H₂₂.\n\n2.  **Count the Bonds:** We need to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds (`=`) in the structure, so there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** There are 12 carbon atoms. A simple acyclic alkane with 12 carbons would have 11 C-C single bonds. Since we have two C=C double bonds, these replace two C-C single bonds, leaving 9 C-C single bonds.\n    *   Summary: 22 C-H bonds, 9 C-C bonds, and 2 C=C bonds.\n\n3.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom_compound):** This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n    *   ΔH_atom_compound = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n\n4.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements (ΔH_atom_elements):** This is the energy required to form the constituent gaseous atoms from their standard states (C(s) and H₂(g)).\n    *   The reaction is `12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`.\n    *   ΔH_atom_elements = (No. of C atoms × ΔH_atom(C)) + (No. of H₂ molecules × BE(H-H))\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):** The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy required to atomize the compound.\n    *   ΔH_f = ΔH_atom_elements - ΔH_atom_compound\n    *   This will give the result in kJ/mol.\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g (if necessary):** Check the units of the options. Some are in kJ/mol and some are in kJ/g. We will need the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂ to convert.\n    *   Molar Mass (C₁₂H₂₂) = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 166 g/mol.\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol).\n\n7.  **Compare and select the final answer.**\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Define constants and molecule structure\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100          # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_single = 200   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_double = 300   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400          # kJ/mol\n\n# From the chemical formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H_atoms / 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the compound (energy required to break its bonds)\ndelta_H_atom_compound = (num_CC_single_bonds * bond_energy_CC_single) + \\\n                        (num_CC_double_bonds * bond_energy_CC_double) + \\\n                        (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH)\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of the compound: {delta_H_atom_compound} kJ/mol\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization for the constituent elements in their standard state\ndelta_H_atom_elements = (num_C_atoms * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H2_molecules * bond_energy_HH)\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of the elements: {delta_H_atom_elements} kJ\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\n# ΔH_f = (Σ Enthalpies of atomization of elements) - (Σ Bond energies of compound)\ndelta_H_f_mol = delta_H_atom_elements - delta_H_atom_compound\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {delta_H_f_mol} kJ/mol\")\n\n# Step 6: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using C=12, H=1 for simplicity as is common in these problems)\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = (num_C_atoms * 12) + (num_H_atoms * 1)\ndelta_H_f_g = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Molar Mass of C12H22: {molar_mass_C12H22} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {round(delta_H_f_g, 2)} kJ/g\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparing with Options ---\")\nprint(\"A) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not formation)\")\nprint(\"B) 67.4 kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"C) 1900 kJ/g (Value matches {delta_H_f_mol}, but unit should be kJ/mol)\")\nprint(f\"D) 11.44 kJ/g (This matches the calculated value of {round(delta_H_f_g, 2)} kJ/g)\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct option is D.\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
