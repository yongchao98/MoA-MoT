    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen, `λ_rest`. This is a constant value of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å).\n    *   The atmospheric cutoff wavelength, `λ_cutoff`. This is the shortest wavelength of light that can penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and be detected by ground-based telescopes. This is approximately 3500 Å. Wavelengths shorter than this (in the ultraviolet range) are absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\n2.  **Understand the Effect of Redshift:**\n    *   Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects like quasars is stretched to longer wavelengths. This phenomenon is called redshift (`z`).\n    *   The relationship between the rest-frame wavelength (`λ_rest`) and the observed wavelength (`λ_observed`) is given by the formula: `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Condition:**\n    *   For the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable by a ground-based optical telescope, its observed wavelength (`λ_observed`) must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (`λ_cutoff`).\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: `λ_observed > λ_cutoff`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Redshift (z):**\n    *   Substitute the redshift formula into our condition: `λ_rest * (1 + z) > λ_cutoff`.\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for the lower limit on `z`:\n        *   `1 + z > λ_cutoff / λ_rest`\n        *   `z > (λ_cutoff / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Value and Compare:**\n    *   Plug in the known values for `λ_rest` and `λ_cutoff` to calculate the minimum redshift `z`.\n    *   Compare the calculated value with the given multiple-choice options to find the best match.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the known physical constants.\n# Rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\nlambda_rest = 1216.0\n\n# The approximate lower wavelength limit for ground-based optical telescopes\n# due to atmospheric absorption (atmospheric cutoff). This is in the near-ultraviolet.\n# A common value used is around 3500 Angstroms.\nlambda_cutoff = 3500.0\n\n# Step 2: Explain the condition for detection.\n# For the Lyman-alpha line to be observed from the ground, its redshifted wavelength\n# (lambda_observed) must be longer than the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n# The formula for redshift is: lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z).\n# So, the condition is: lambda_rest * (1 + z) > lambda_cutoff.\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the lower limit on the redshift (z).\n# Rearranging the formula: z > (lambda_cutoff / lambda_rest) - 1.\nz_min = (lambda_cutoff / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# Step 4: Print the results and the available choices.\nprint(f\"Rest-frame Lyman-alpha wavelength (λ_rest): {lambda_rest} Angstroms\")\nprint(f\"Atmospheric cutoff wavelength (λ_cutoff): ~{lambda_cutoff} Angstroms\")\nprint(\"\\nTo be detected, the observed wavelength must be greater than the cutoff:\")\nprint(\"λ_observed > λ_cutoff\")\nprint(\"λ_rest * (1 + z) > λ_cutoff\")\nprint(f\"z > (λ_cutoff / λ_rest) - 1\")\nprint(f\"z > ({lambda_cutoff} / {lambda_rest}) - 1\")\nprint(f\"z > {z_min:.4f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the lower limit on the redshift 'z' is approximately 1.88.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nLet's compare this with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 2.4\")\nprint(\"B) 3\")\nprint(\"C) 1.2\")\nprint(\"D) 1.9\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of 1.88 is closest to 1.9.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Selection:\")\nprint(\"The lower limit on the redshift of these objects is estimated to be 1.9.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
