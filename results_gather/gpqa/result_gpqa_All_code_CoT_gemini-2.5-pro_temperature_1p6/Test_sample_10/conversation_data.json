    "Here is my plan to solve the question.\n1.  I will analyze each statement based on current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology.\n2.  Statement A describes the -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting event that produces pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins. This is a hallmark of coronaviruses, and the mechanism involving a slippery sequence and an RNA pseudoknot is well-established. The high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 extends to this critical regulatory element. This statement appears correct.\n3.  Statement C discusses the biophysical properties of the frameshifting pseudoknot. Research, particularly using single-molecule techniques like optical tweezers, has shown that the conformational dynamics of the pseudoknot are crucial for its function and that it can adopt multiple conformations under tension. This statement reflects findings from specialized studies and is considered correct.\n4.  Statement D describes the pro-apoptotic activity of the ORF3a protein. Studies have shown that ORF3a can induce apoptosis. The specific mention of caspase-8 activation (a marker for the extrinsic pathway) without altering Bcl-2 (a key regulator of the intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway) correctly points to the extrinsic pathway as the mechanism. This statement is correct.\n5.  Statement B describes the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. This complex is a crucial part of the viral replication machinery, acting as a proofreading exoribonuclease. Its function is to *remove* mismatched nucleotides from the newly synthesized RNA strand. This involves the enzymatic *degradation* or breakdown of a small portion of the RNA. The statement claims the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA. This is a mischaracterization of its primary function. While proofreading ultimately helps the virus evade the host immune system (which detects aberrant dsRNA), the direct action of the enzyme is to *cause* breakdown for error correction, not to prevent it. Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect in its description of the enzyme's activity.\n6.  Based on this analysis, statement B is the incorrect one. I will write a Python script to print the letter 'B'.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_mcq():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided statements about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology and identifies the incorrect one.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The statements for the multiple-choice question.\n    statements = {\n        'A': \"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot.
