    "My plan is to solve this problem by analyzing the chemical properties of each compound mentioned.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n2.  I will examine **benzoquinone**. Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of the double bonds and lack any hydrogen atoms. Therefore, it has no alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n3.  I will examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. It has three ketone groups on a saturated six-membered ring. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each has two hydrogen atoms. Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, it readily shows tautomerism, forming a very stable aromatic enol (phloroglucinol).\n4.  Based on this, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Optical isomerism** is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  I will analyze **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n3.  I will analyze **dimethyl fumarate**. This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group on each of the double-bonded carbons. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n4.  Based on this, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n*   This combination corresponds to option A. I will now write a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect print to a string buffer to check if it's being used.\nimport io\n\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# This is a conceptual problem from chemistry.
