    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28% or 0.1428.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008). Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), this simplifies to y / (12x + y).\n    *   Setting y / (12x + y) = 0.1428 (or more accurately, 1/7), we find that y / (12x) ≈ 0.166, which means y/x ≈ 2.\n    *   So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ or a cycloalkane CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   The empirical formula CH₂ corresponds to the general formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Given that Z is a common solvent, the most likely candidate is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and one of them is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. A disproportionation reaction involves a substance being simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In the context of hydrocarbons, this often means a hydrogen transfer, where one molecule loses hydrogen (oxidation) and another gains it (reduction).\n    *   A substance that forms cyclohexane upon hydrogenation is benzene (C₆H₆). C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This mixture does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, which fits the description.\n\n3.  **Identify the components of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that form Y (benzene + cyclohexane) upon disproportionation.\n    *   The overall reaction can be seen as a hydrogen transfer between the two components of X: A + B → Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Both components A and B must have a C₆ carbon skeleton, as their hydrogenation yields only cyclohexane.\n    *   Both components decolorize bromine water, so they must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are unsaturated).\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated double bonds in X.\n    *   Let's consider possible reactants. A likely pair is a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) and cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀).\n    *   The two isomers of cyclohexadiene are 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem rules out the conjugated isomer.\n    *   Therefore, one component of X is **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The other component is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**.\n    *   Let's check the reaction:\n        C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n    *   In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H) to benzene, and cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H) to cyclohexane. This is a perfect hydrogen transfer reaction that fits all the problem's conditions.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.**\n    *   The two liquids in X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) and cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₈) + (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the components of mixture X based on the chemical deduction.\n# Component 1 of X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n# Component 2 of X is cyclohexene (C6H10).\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in the first liquid (1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8)\nh_atoms_liquid1 = 8\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in the second liquid (cyclohexene, C6H10)\nh_atoms_liquid2 = 10\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids.\ntotal_h_atoms = h_atoms_liquid1 + h_atoms_liquid2\n\n# Step 3: Print the result.\n# The available options are:\n# A) 12\n# B) 18\n# C) 22\n# D) 16\nprint(f\"The first liquid in mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, which has {h_atoms_liquid1} hydrogen atoms.\")\nprint(f\"The second liquid in mixture X is cyclohexene, which has {h_atoms_liquid2} hydrogen atoms.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is: {total_h_atoms}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
