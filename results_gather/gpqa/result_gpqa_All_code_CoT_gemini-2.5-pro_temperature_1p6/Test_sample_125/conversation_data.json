    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a ketone and is chiral, with a defined stereocenter at the 5th carbon (C5).\n    *   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n    *   **Products:** Since there is a pre-existing stereocenter at C5 that remains unchanged, the formation of the new stereocenter at C3 can occur in two ways (R or S configuration). This results in the formation of a pair of **diastereomers**:\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess NaBHâ‚„ (sodium borohydride) will reduce both ketone groups to alcohol groups, creating the product pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   **Products:** Let's examine the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:** (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers** of each other. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are identical; they represent a single **meso compound** which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n3.  **Combine All Products:**\n    The final mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n    *   From Reaction I: Two diastereomers.\n    *   From Reaction II: A pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n4.  **Analyze using Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It **cannot** separate enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Peak Counting:**\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will separate as its own **1 peak**.\n        *   The pair of enantiomers from Reaction II have identical physical properties and will elute together as a single **1 peak**.\n    *   **Total for Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Analyze using Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of all non-identical stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   **Peak Counting:** Since the chiral column can resolve all five unique stereoisomers in the mixture, we will observe one peak for each.\n        *   Diastereomer 1 (from Rxn I) -> **1 peak**\n        *   Diastereomer 2 (from Rxn I) -> **1 peak**\n        *   Enantiomer 1 (from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n        *   Enantiomer 2 (from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n        *   Meso compound (from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n    *   **Total for Chiral HPLC:** 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. This corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral-phase HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Reaction I Analysis ---\n    # Starting Material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one (a single chiral enantiomer)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of a ketone with LAH creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    # The pre-existing stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    # This results in the formation of two diastereomers.\n    reaction_I_products = [\n        \"(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\",\n        \"(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\"\n    ]\n    num_products_I = len(reaction_I_products)\n\n    # --- Reaction II Analysis ---\n    # Starting Material: Pentane-2,4-dione (achiral)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of two ketones with NaBH4 creates two new stereocenters (C2 and C4).\n    # The possible products are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and meso-(2R, 4S).\n    # (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n    reaction_II_products = [\n        \"(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\", # Enantiomer A\n        \"(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\", # Enantiomer B (mirror image of A)\n        \"(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\"  # Meso compound\n    ]\n    num_products_II = len(reaction_II_products)\n\n    total_compounds = reaction_I_products + reaction_II_products\n\n    # --- HPLC Analysis ---\n\n    # 1.
