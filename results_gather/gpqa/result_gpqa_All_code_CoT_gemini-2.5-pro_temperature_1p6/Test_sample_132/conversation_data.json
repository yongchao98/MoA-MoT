    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($PO_4^{3-}$):\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles** of each component added to the solution. The components are $KH_2PO_4$ (which provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion, $H_2PO_4^−$) and $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ (which provides the hydrogen phosphate ion, $HPO_4^{2−}$).\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations** of $H_2PO_4^−$ and $HPO_4^{2−}$ in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Volume (in Liters)\n\n3.  **Identify the relevant equilibrium**. The primary equilibrium that sets the pH of the solution is the one involving the conjugate acid-base pair we added, which is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    *   $H_2PO_4^- \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + HPO_4^{2-}$\n    *   $K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration ($[H^+]$)**. We can use the equilibrium expression for $K_{a2}$ to find $[H^+]$:\n    *   $K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}$\n    *   Rearranging for $[H^+]$: $[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    *   We can use the initial concentrations calculated in step 2 because this is a buffer solution, and the change in their concentrations is negligible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration ($[PO_4^{3-}]$)**. This concentration is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, using the $[H^+]$ we just found:\n    *   $HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-}$\n    *   $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: $K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    *   Rearranging to solve for $[PO_4^{3-}]$: $[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n\n6.  **Compare the final calculated concentration** to the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n\nvolume_cm3 = 200.00  # cm3\nvolume_L = volume_cm3 / 1000.0  # Convert cm3 (mL) to Liters\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles of each component ---\n# KH2PO4 dissociates to K+ and H2PO4-\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n\n# Na2HPO4*2H2O dissociates to 2Na+, HPO4(2-) and 2H2O\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the initial molar concentrations ---\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 3 & 4: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium ---\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4(2-)]\nconc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4(3-)] from the Ka3 equilibrium ---\n# [PO4(3-)] = Ka3 * [HPO4(2-)] / [H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_h_plus)\n\n# --- Step 6: Print results and compare with options ---\nprint(f\"Calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-): {conc_po4_3minus:.3e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\n\n# Find the closest option\noptions = {\n    'A': 3.97e-7,\n    'B': 6.24e-7,\n    'C': 5.48e-7,\n    'D': 2.81e-7\n}\n\nclosest_option = min(options.keys(), key=lambda option: abs(options[option] - conc_po4_3minus))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\nfinal_answer = closest_option\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {final_answer}\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
