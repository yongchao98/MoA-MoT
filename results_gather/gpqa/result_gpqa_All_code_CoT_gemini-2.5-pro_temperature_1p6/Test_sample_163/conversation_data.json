    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law:** The total mass (`M_total`) of a double-line spectroscopic, eclipsing binary system is related to its orbital period (`P`) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of its two stars (`K1 + K2`). The relationship is given by the formula:\n    `M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the orbital inclination. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, making `sin(i)` ≈ 1.\n\n2.  **Simplify for a ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (`M1_total`) to the mass of system 2 (`M2_total`). When we create this ratio, the constant terms `(1 / (2 * π * G))` and the `sin³(i)` term will cancel out, as they are the same for both systems. This leaves us with a simpler proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio calculation:** The factor by which system 1 is more massive than system 2 is the ratio `M1_total / M2_total`. Using the proportionality from the previous step, this becomes:\n    `Ratio = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]`\n\n4.  **Plug in the values and compute:**\n    *   For system 1: P1 = 2 years, K1_1 = 10 km/s, K1_2 = 5 km/s.\n    *   For system 2: P2 = 1 year, K2_1 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s.\n    *   We will use these values in the formula to calculate the final ratio.\n\n5.  **Write the Python code:** The code will define these variables, perform the calculation as described above, and print the resulting factor to be compared with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- System 1 Data ---\n# Period in years\nP1 = 2.0\n# Radial velocity amplitudes in km/s\nK1_1 = 10.0\nK1_2 = 5.0\n\n# --- System 2 Data ---\n# Period in years\nP2 = 1.0\n# Radial velocity amplitudes in km/s\nK2_1 = 15.0\nK2_2 = 10.0\n\n# The total mass of a double-line spectroscopic binary is proportional to P * (K1 + K2)^3.\n# The constant of proportionality cancels out when we take the ratio.\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocities for each system\nK_sum_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\nK_sum_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the mass ratio (proportional to the mass of system 1)\nmass_term_1 = P1 * (K_sum_1 ** 3)\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the mass ratio (proportional to the mass of system 2)\nmass_term_2 = P2 * (K_sum_2 ** 3)\n\n# Calculate the final ratio\nmass_ratio = mass_term_1 / mass_term_2\n\nprint(\"Given options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 0.4\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.6\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.2\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 0.7\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculation:\")\nprint(f\"The sum of velocities for system 1 is: {K_sum_1} km/s\")\nprint(f\"The sum of velocities for system 2 is: {K_sum_2} km/s\")\nprint(f\"The ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is: {mass_ratio:.3f}\")\nprint(\"The calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
