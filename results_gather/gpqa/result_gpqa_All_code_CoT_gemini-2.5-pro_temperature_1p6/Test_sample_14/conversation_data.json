    "My plan is to determine the correct option by calculating the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Formula**: For a planet with a circular orbit, the geometric transit probability (`Prob_transit`) is approximately the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_star`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `Prob_transit ≈ R_star / a`\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: The semi-major axis `a` is related to the orbital period `P` and the host star's mass `M_star`. From Kepler's Third Law, `P² ∝ a³ / M_star`. We can rearrange this to solve for `a`: `a³ ∝ M_star * P²`, which gives `a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\n3.  **Probability Dependence**: By substituting the expression for `a` into the probability formula, we can see how the probability depends on the given physical parameters:\n    `Prob_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n    `Prob_transit ∝ R_star * M_star^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n4.  **Ratio of Probabilities**: To compare the two planets, we will calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `Prob_1 / Prob_2`:\n    `Ratio = (R_star1 * M_star1^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)) / (R_star2 * M_star2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3))`\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Information**: We are provided with the following relationships:\n    *   `R_star1 = R_star2` (Stellar radii are the same)\n    *   `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2` (Star 1 is twice as massive as Star 2)\n    *   `P1 = P2 / 3` (Planet 1's period is one-third of Planet 2's)\n\n    Plugging these into the ratio equation, the terms for `R_star2`, `M_star2`, and `P2` cancel out, leaving a numerical factor:\n    `Ratio = (1 * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)) / (1 * (1)^(-1/3) * (1)^(-2/3))`\n    `Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3) = (3² / 2)^(1/3) = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: I will now use Python to compute the value of this ratio and identify the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of probabilities is derived from the transit probability formula\n# Prob_transit is proportional to R_star * M_star^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)\n# Given: R_star1 = R_star2, M_star1 = 2 * M_star2, P1 = P2 / 3\n# The ratio Prob_1 / Prob_2 simplifies to (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n# Calculate the numerical value of the ratio\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\n\n# Define the options\noption_A = \"A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\"\noption_B = \"B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\"\noption_C = \"C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\"\noption_D = \"D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\"\n\n# Print the calculated ratio\nprint(f\"The ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2 is approximately {ratio:.2f}.\")\n\n# Determine the correct option based on the calculated ratio\n# Since the ratio is > 1, Planet_1 has a higher probability.\n# We compare the calculated ratio to the values in the options.\nif 1.6 < ratio < 1.7:\n    correct_option = option_A\nelif 2.2 < ratio < 2.3:\n    correct_option = option_B\nelif 2.6 < ratio < 2.8:\n    correct_option = option_C\nelif 1.4 < ratio < 1.6:\n    correct_option = option_D\nelse:\n    correct_option = \"None of the options match the calculated ratio.\"\n\nprint(\"The most accurate statement is:\")\nprint(correct_option)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
