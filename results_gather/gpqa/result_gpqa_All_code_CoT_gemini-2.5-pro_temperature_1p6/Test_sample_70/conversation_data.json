    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Establish the relationship between equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and orbital distance (a).** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. This relationship shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance ($T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a}$).\n2.  **Establish the relationship between orbital distance (a) and orbital period (P).** According to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($P^2 \\propto a^3$). For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance. Therefore, we can write $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n3.  **Combine the relationships to link equilibrium temperature and orbital period.** By substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship, we find that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period ($T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$).\n4.  **Calculate the temperature ratio.** The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$) will be equal to the ratio of their periods raised to the power of -1/3, which is $(P_4/P_2)^{-1/3}$ or $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$.\n5.  **Use the given period ratios to find the answer.** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We will use the values for Planet_2 (2) and Planet_4 (3.5) to calculate the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the orbital period ratios for Planet_2 and Planet_4.\n# The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5\n# for Planet_1 through Planet_5 respectively.\nP2_ratio = 2.0\nP4_ratio = 3.5\n\n# Step 2: The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital period (P)\n# for planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo is T_eq is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is (P4 / P2)^(-1/3),\n# which simplifies to (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the periods.\nperiod_ratio = P2_ratio / P4_ratio\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the equilibrium temperature ratio.\ntemp_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and the options.\nprint(\"The ratio of orbital periods (P2 / P4) is:\", period_ratio)\nprint(\"The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq4 / T_eq2) is (P2 / P4)^(1/3), which is approximately:\", round(temp_ratio, 2))\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~0.69\")\nprint(\"B) ~0.83\")\nprint(\"C) ~0.75\")\nprint(\"D) ~0.57\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of ~0.83 matches option B.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
