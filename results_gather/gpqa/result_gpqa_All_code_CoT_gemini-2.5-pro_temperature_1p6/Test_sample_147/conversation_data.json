    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The crucial piece of information is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, M_Y is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (M_F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    M_Y = (n * M_F / ωF) - (n * M_F)\n    By testing small integer values for n, we can find a plausible molar mass for Y that matches a known element.\n\n2.  **Test Values for n:**\n    *   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.4 g/mol (Calcium/Argon range, unlikely)\n    *   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, possible)\n    *   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.3 g/mol (Antimony, very strong candidate)\n    *   If n = 4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No common element matches)\n\n3.  **Confirm Y is Antimony (Sb):** The molar mass of Antimony (Sb) is 121.76 g/mol, which is extremely close to the calculated value for n=3. Let's verify by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\n    ωF in SbF₃ = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%, confirming that Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃.\n\n4.  **Identify Other Compounds:**\n    *   The other common binary fluoride of antimony is SbF₅.\n    *   SbF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid, known to react with xenon, which fits the description of A1 and A3.\n    *   The remaining compounds in the problem are A4 and A5. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony.\n\n5.  **Determine A4:** The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. The most likely candidates for a binary fluoride of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF₃ = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF₅ = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** Now, let's check which of these molecular weights falls into the given ranges:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 220-240\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly within range A (160-180). The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any of the provided ranges. Therefore, A4 must be SbF₃.\n\nThe provided information about the reaction to form A5 is complex and potentially confusing, but it is not needed to identify A4 based on the molecular weight options.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.\nwF_A2 = 0.3196  # Mass percentage of Fluorine in A2\nM_F = 19.00      # Molar mass of Fluorine\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Determine the molar mass of element Y based on the formula YFn.\")\nprint(\"M_Y = (n * M_F / wF) - (n * M_F)\\n\")\n\nfor n in range(1, 6):\n    M_Y_calculated = (n * M_F / wF_A2) - (n * M_F)\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, calculated M_Y is approximately {M_Y_calculated:.2f} g/mol\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Compare the calculated molar masses with known elements.\")\nprint(\"For n = 3, the calculated M_Y (121.35 g/mol) is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\")\nprint(\"Let's confirm this identification.\")\n\n# Step 3: Confirm Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3.\nM_Sb = 121.76 # Molar mass of Antimony\nn = 3\nM_SbF3 = M_Sb + n * M_F\nwF_SbF3 = (n * M_F / M_SbF3)\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Verifying the identity of Y as Sb.\")\nprint(f\"The theoretical mass percentage of F in SbF3 is: ({n} * {M_F}) / {M_SbF3:.2f} = {wF_SbF3:.4f} or {wF_SbF3*100:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"This value ({wF_SbF3*100:.2f}%) is a very close match to the given value (31.96%), confirming Y=Sb and A2=SbF3.\\n\")\n\n# Step 4, 5, 6: Determine A4 by comparing molecular weights of Sb fluorides with the given options.\nM_SbF5 = M_Sb + 5 * M_F\nprint(\"Step 4: Identify possible candidates for A4, which is a binary fluoride of Sb.\")\nprint(f\"Candidate 1: SbF3, Molecular Weight = {M_SbF3:.2f} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Candidate 2: SbF5, Molecular Weight = {M_SbF5:.2f} g/mol\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 5: Compare these molecular weights with the given options.\")\noptions = {\n    'A': (160, 180),\n    'B': (140, 160),\n    'C': (110, 130),\n    'D': (220, 240)\n}\n\nprint(f\"Options are:\")\nfor choice, (low, high) in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) {low}-{high}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 6: Conclusion\")\na4_is_sbf3 = options['A'][0] <= M_SbF3 <= options['A'][1]\na4_is_sbf5 = options['D'][0] <= M_SbF5 <= options['D'][1]\n\nif a4_is_sbf3:\n    print(f\"The molecular weight of SbF3 ({M_SbF3:.2f} g/mol) falls into range A ({options['A'][0]}-{options['A'][1]}).\")\nif not (options['A'][0] <= M_SbF5 <= options['A'][1] or options['B'][0] <= M_SbF5 <= options['B'][1] or options['C'][0] <= M_SbF5 <= options['C'][1] or options['D'][0] <= M_SbF5 <= options['D'][1]):\n     print(f\"The molecular weight of SbF5 ({M_SbF5:.2f} g/mol) does not fall into any of the given ranges.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, substance A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct option is A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
