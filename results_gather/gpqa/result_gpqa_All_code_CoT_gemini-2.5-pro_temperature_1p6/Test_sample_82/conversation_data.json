    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Diluted Concentration of Acetic Acid**: First, we need to find the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. The dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 will be used, where M1 and V1 are the initial concentration and volume, and M2 and V2 are the final concentration and volume.\n2.  **Calculate pH at 25% Titration**: At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), leaving 75% of the acid unreacted. This creates a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n3.  **Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**: At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion then hydrolyzes in water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻) and making the solution basic. We will calculate the concentration of the acetate ion, then find the Kb for its hydrolysis reaction (Kb = Kw / Ka). Using an ICE table approach, we will determine the concentration of OH⁻, calculate the pOH, and finally find the pH using the relationship pH = 14 - pOH.\n4.  **Compare and Select**: The calculated pH values at 25% titration and the equivalence point will be compared with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_titration_ph():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point for the titration\n    of diluted acetic acid with NaOH.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given values ---\n    initial_vol_acid_cm3 = 20.00\n    initial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\n    vol_water_cm3 = 20.00\n    conc_naoh = 0.1  # M\n    Ka_acid = 1.85e-5\n    Kw = 1.0e-14 # at 25 C\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate diluted acid concentration ---\n    initial_vol_acid_L = initial_vol_acid_cm3 / 1000.0\n    total_vol_diluted_cm3 = initial_vol_acid_cm3 + vol_water_cm3\n    total_vol_diluted_L = total_vol_diluted_cm3 / 1000.0\n\n    # Using M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (M2)\n    diluted_conc_acid = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid_L) / total_vol_diluted_L\n    \n    # Calculate initial moles of acid in the diluted solution\n    initial_moles_acid = diluted_conc_acid * total_vol_diluted_L\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% titration ---\n    # At 25% titration, we have a buffer where [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\n    pKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n    \n    # Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n    ratio = 0.25 / 0.75  # [A-]/[HA]\n    ph_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate pH at the equivalence point ---\n    # At the equivalence point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base (A-)\n    # Moles of NaOH added = initial moles of acid\n    moles_naoh_at_equiv = initial_moles_acid\n    \n    # Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence\n    vol_naoh_at_equiv_L = moles_naoh_at_equiv / conc_naoh\n    \n    # Total volume at equivalence point\n    total_vol_at_equiv_L = total_vol_diluted_L + vol_naoh_at_equiv_L\n    \n    # Concentration of the conjugate base (A-) at equivalence\n    conc_A_minus_at_equiv = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_at_equiv_L\n    \n    # The conjugate base hydrolyzes: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n    # Calculate Kb from Ka\n    Kb = Kw / Ka_acid\n    \n    # Solve for [OH-] using Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] = x^2 / (C - x)\n    # We can approximate that x is small, so Kb ≈ x^2 / C\n    # x = [OH-]\n    conc_OH_at_equiv = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_at_equiv)\n    \n    # Calculate pOH and then pH\n    pOH_at_equiv = -math.log10(conc_OH_at_equiv)\n    pH_at_equiv = 14.0 - pOH_at_equiv\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Output the results and find the matching choice ---\n    print(f\"pH at 25% titration: {ph_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equiv:.2f}\")\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': (4.57, 6.92),\n        'B': (4.73, 7.00),\n        'C': (4.26, 8.52),\n        'D': (3.17, 6.73),\n    }\n\n    # Find the choice that matches our calculation\n    for choice, values in options.items():\n        if math.isclose(ph_at_25_percent, values[0], rel_tol=1e-2) and math.isclose(pH_at_equiv, values[1], rel_tol=1e-2):\n            # Print the final answer choice in the required format\n            print(f\"<<<{choice}>>>\")\n            return\n\nsolve_titration_ph()\n```"
