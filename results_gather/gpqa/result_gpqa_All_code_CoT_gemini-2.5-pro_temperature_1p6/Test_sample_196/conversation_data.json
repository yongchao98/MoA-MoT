    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X:** I will interpret the key peaks in the IR spectrum to identify the functional groups present. The broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 and the sharp peak at 1720 cm-1 are highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest the presence of an aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:** I will analyze each signal in the 1H NMR spectrum to piece together the structure of the molecule.\n    *   The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.\n    *   The two doublets in the aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm signal is consistent with protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carboxylic acid.\n    *   I will analyze the remaining signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm) to determine the structure of the alkyl substituent. This pattern corresponds to a sec-butyl group [-CH(CH3)(CH2CH3)].\n\n3.  **Identify Compound X:** By combining the IR and NMR data, I will deduce the structure of Compound X. The data points to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option (B).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction:** I will identify the role of the reagents, red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent known for completely reducing carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkyl (specifically, methyl) groups.\n\n5.  **Predict the Final Product:** I will apply the reaction to Compound X. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring will remain unchanged. The final product will be 1-sec-butyl-4-methylbenzene.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Option:** I will compare my predicted final product with the given options and select the correct choice. The structure 1-sec-butyl-4-methylbenzene matches option (C).\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the provided spectral data to identify Compound X.\n# IR data analysis:\n# - 3400–2500 cm-1 (broad): O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n# - 1720 cm-1 (strong): C=O stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n# - 1610, 1450 cm-1: C=C stretches of an aromatic ring.\n# Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring.\n\n# 1H NMR data analysis:\n# - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet for 1 proton, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n# - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets in the aromatic region indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.\n# - The remaining signals define the alkyl substituent:\n#   - 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A methine (-CH-) proton, likely benzylic (attached to the ring).\n#   - 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A methylene (-CH2-) group.\n#   - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl (-CH3) group split by one proton (the methine).\n#   - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A methyl (-CH3) group split by two protons (the methylene).\n# - This splitting pattern and integration corresponds to a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3).\n\n# Step 2: Combine the analyses to determine the structure of Compound X.\n# The structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n# This structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which corresponds to option B.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the chemical reaction.\n# Reactants: Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) and red phosphorus with HI.\n# Reagents (Red P / HI): This is a very strong reducing agent. Its specific function here is to reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n# Step 4: Predict the final product.\n# The reaction converts the -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into a -CH3 group.\n# The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring are unaffected.\n# Starting material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n# Final product: 1-sec-butyl-4-methylbenzene\n\n# Step 5: Match the predicted product with the given options.\n# A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group.\n# B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n# C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\n# D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n\n# The correct choice is C.\n\nfinal_answer = \"C\"\nprint(f\"The analysis indicates that Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\")\nprint(f\"The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3).\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the final product is 1-sec-butyl-4-methylbenzene.\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
