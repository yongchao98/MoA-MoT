    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles**: This is a particle decay problem. The key principles are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum**: The initial particle, the pion ($\\pi^+$), is stationary, so the initial total momentum is zero. After the decay, the products—the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$)—must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum to keep the total momentum zero.\n    *   $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Before**: The total energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, $E_{\\text{initial}} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n    *   **After**: The total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, $E_{\\text{final}} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Therefore, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**: The total energy $E$, momentum $p$, and rest mass $m$ of a particle are related by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$.\n    *   For the neutrino ($\\nu$): We assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$. The kinetic energy of the neutrino is its total energy, so $\\text{KE}_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n5.  **Solve for the Kinetic Energies**: We can substitute $pc = E_{\\nu}$ into the muon's energy equation: $E_{\\mu}^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$.\n    From energy conservation, we also have $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$.\n    Substituting this gives:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu})^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    Expanding and solving for $E_{\\nu}$ (which is $\\text{KE}_{\\nu}$), we get:\n    $\\text{KE}_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses: $\\text{KE}_{\\text{total}} = (m_{\\pi} - m_{\\mu})c^2 = \\text{KE}_{\\mu} + \\text{KE}_{\\nu}$.\n    We can calculate $\\text{KE}_{\\nu}$ and then find $\\text{KE}_{\\mu}$ using $\\text{KE}_{\\mu} = \\text{KE}_{\\text{total}} - \\text{KE}_{\\nu}$.\n\nThe following python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass of Pi(+) in MeV/c^2\nm_pi = 139.6\n# Rest mass of mu(+) in MeV/c^2\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# In these units, we can treat the masses as energies (since c^2 cancels out).\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) using the derived formula.\n# KE_nu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\nke_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest masses (Q-value).\nq_value = m_pi - m_mu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) is the total KE minus the neutrino's KE.\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# The question asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles, muon and neutrino.\n# We will print them in the order: KE_mu, KE_nu\nprint(f\"The kinetic energies of the product particles are:\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n# Let's check which option this corresponds to.\n# Option A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n# Option B) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n# Option C) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n# Option D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n# Our result (4.12 MeV, 29.78 MeV) matches option A.\n```\n<<<A>>>"
