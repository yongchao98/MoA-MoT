    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total electrostatic potential energy of the system of 13 charges. The total energy is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. The system will arrange itself to achieve the minimum possible energy.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Define Constants:** We will use the standard values for the elementary charge (`e`) and Coulomb's constant (`k`). The charge of each particle is `q = 2e`, and the radius is `r = 2 m`.\n2.  **Separate Energy Components:** The total energy `U_total` can be broken down into two parts:\n    *   `U_center_sphere`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n    *   `U_sphere_sphere`: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n3.  **Calculate `U_center_sphere`:** There are 12 charges on the sphere, each at a fixed distance `r` from the central charge. The energy is simply `12 * (k * q^2 / r)`.\n4.  **Calculate `U_sphere_sphere`:** To minimize their mutual repulsion, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves into a regular icosahedron. The potential energy of this configuration is `U_sphere_sphere = C_12 * (k * q^2 / r)`, where `C_12` is a geometric coefficient for the icosahedron (part of the solution to the \"Thomson Problem\" for N=12).\n5.  **Calculate `C_12`:** The coefficient `C_12` is the sum of the inverse distances between all pairs of points on a unit-radius sphere arranged in an icosahedron. For an icosahedron, there are 30 pairs of nearest neighbors, 30 pairs of next-nearest neighbors, and 6 pairs of diametrically opposite points. We can calculate `C_12` based on the chord lengths for these pairs.\n6.  **Sum the Energies:** The total minimum energy is `U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`.\n7.  **Final Output:** The Python code will perform these calculations and print the final energy value, which we can then compare to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and problem parameters.\n# Elementary charge in Coulombs\ne = 1.602176634e-19\n# Coulomb's constant in N m^2 / C^2\nk = 8.9875517923e9\n# Number of particles on the sphere\nN_sphere = 12\n# Charge of each particle (2 * elementary charge)\nq = 2 * e\n# Radius of the sphere in meters\nr = 2.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the potential energy from the interaction between\n# the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\nU_center_sphere = N_sphere * k * q**2 / r\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the potential energy from interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n# For minimum energy, these 12 charges form a regular icosahedron.\n# We first calculate the geometric coefficient C_12 for an icosahedron.\n# The coefficient is the sum of inverse distances for all pairs on a unit sphere.\n\n# There are three distinct distances between vertices in an icosahedron.\n# We calculate them for a sphere of radius 1.\n# The angle theta between two vertices on a sphere is related to their chord distance d by d = sqrt(2 - 2*cos(theta)).\n# For an icosahedron:\n# - 5 nearest neighbors at angle theta1 = arccos(1/sqrt(5))\n# - 5 next-nearest neighbors at angle theta2 = arccos(-1/sqrt(5))\n# - 1 opposite neighbor at angle theta3 = pi (180 degrees)\nd1_unit = math.sqrt(2 - 2 * (1 / math.sqrt(5)))\nd2_unit = math.sqrt(2 + 2 * (1 / math.sqrt(5)))\nd3_unit = 2.0  # Diameter of a unit sphere\n\n# The total number of pairs on the sphere is N*(N-1)/2 = 66. These consist of:\n# - 30 pairs of nearest neighbors (the edges of the icosahedron)\n# - 30 pairs of next-nearest neighbors\n# - 6 pairs of opposite neighbors (diagonals through the center)\nC_12 = (30 / d1_unit) + (30 / d2_unit) + (6 / d3_unit)\n\n# The energy of the 12 charges on the sphere is C_12 scaled by k*q^2/r.\nU_sphere_sphere = C_12 * k * q**2 / r\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total minimum energy of the system by summing the components.\nU_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere\n\n# Step 5: Print the final answer. The options are given in scientific notation.\n# Our result should be compared to the options to find the correct choice.\n# The value is printed to match the format of the options.\nprint(f\"The total minimum energy of the system is {U_total:.3e} Joules.\")\nprint(\"The available options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 7.056 x 10^-27\")\nprint(\"B) 122.330\")\nprint(\"C) 2.822 x 10^-26\")\nprint(\"D) 5.645 x 10^-26\")\nprint(\"The calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
