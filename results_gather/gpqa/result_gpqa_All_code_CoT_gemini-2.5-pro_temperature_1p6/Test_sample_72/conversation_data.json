    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this relativistic physics problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):** I will use the formula for relativistic velocity subtraction since both astronauts are moving in the same direction. The formula is:\n    `v_rel = (v_1 - v_2) / (1 - (v_1 * v_2) / c^2)`\n    I will substitute the given speeds `v_1 = 0.6c` and `v_2 = 0.5c` into this formula to find the relative speed in terms of `c`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E_1 + E_2`). The energy for a single particle is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   I will first calculate the Lorentz factor for each astronaut (`γ_1` and `γ_2`).\n    *   Then, I will calculate the energy for each astronaut (`E_1 = γ_1 * m_1 * c^2` and `E_2 = γ_2 * m_2 * c^2`).\n    *   Finally, I will sum these energies to find the total energy of the system in terms of `mc^2`.\n\n3.  **Match with Options:** After calculating `v_rel` and `E_total`, I will compare the results with the given multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Velocities as fractions of c\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\n# Masses as multiples of m\nm1_factor = 2\nm2_factor = 3\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel) ---\n# The formula for relative velocity is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2) in terms of c.\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the total energy (E_total) ---\n# First, calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for each astronaut.\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n\n# Second, calculate the energy for each astronaut in terms of mc^2.\n# E = gamma * (mass_factor * m) * c^2\n# We calculate the coefficient for mc^2.\nenergy1_coeff = gamma1 * m1_factor\nenergy2_coeff = gamma2 * m2_factor\n\n# Finally, sum the energies.\ntotal_energy_coeff = energy1_coeff + energy2_coeff\n\n# --- Step 3: Print the results and determine the correct option ---\nprint(f\"Calculated relative speed: {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total energy: {total_energy_coeff:.2f}mc^2\")\n\n# Compare with the options\noptions = {\n    'A': {'v_rel': 1.1, 'E': 1.00},\n    'B': {'v_rel': 0.14, 'E': 5.00},\n    'C': {'v_rel': 0.1, 'E': 4.96},\n    'D': {'v_rel': 0.14, 'E': 5.96}\n}\n\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option, values in options.items():\n    if math.isclose(v_rel, values['v_rel'], rel_tol=1e-2) and math.isclose(total_energy_coeff, values['E'], rel_tol=1e-2):\n        correct_option = option\n        break\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated values match option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {correct_option}\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
