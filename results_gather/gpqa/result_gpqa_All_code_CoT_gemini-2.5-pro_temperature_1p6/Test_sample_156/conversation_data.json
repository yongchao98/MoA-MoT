    "Of course, let's break down the problem and find the correct approach for designing a diagnostic kit for a retrovirus.\n\nMy plan is to analyze each option based on the biological nature of a retrovirus and the principles of modern molecular diagnostics.\n\n1.  **Define the key terms**: A \"retrovirus\" has an RNA genome. \"Molecular diagnostics\" aims to detect the genetic material of the pathogen directly. \"Quick detection\" is crucial for managing an outbreak.\n2.  **Evaluate Option A**: This option suggests converting the viral material to cDNA (complementary DNA) for sequencing. This is the correct procedure for an RNA virus, called reverse transcription. It then proposes a real-time PCR kit, which is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for detecting and quantifying genetic material, making it a gold standard for viral diagnostics.\n3.  **Evaluate Option B**: This option starts with identifying the virus by symptoms, which is unreliable because many different pathogens can cause similar symptoms. A specific molecular kit requires a precise genetic target, not a guess based on symptoms.\n4.  **Evaluate Option C**: This describes an ELISA for IgG antibodies. This is a serological test, not a molecular one. More importantly, IgG antibodies appear relatively late in an infection, making this method unsuitable for *quick* or early diagnosis during an outbreak.\n5.  **Evaluate Option D**: This option incorrectly suggests performing DNA sequencing directly. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so you cannot sequence their DNA without first converting the RNA to cDNA. This option contains a fundamental error.\n6.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Option A presents the most scientifically accurate and effective strategy for developing a rapid molecular diagnostic kit for a new retrovirus.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_diagnostic_kit_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the options for designing a retrovirus diagnostic kit and prints the solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Explanation of the core scientific principles\n    print(\"To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, we must consider its biology.\")\n    print(\"1.
