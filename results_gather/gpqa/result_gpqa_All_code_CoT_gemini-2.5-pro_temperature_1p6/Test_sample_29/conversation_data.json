    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:** The relationship between a photon's energy (E) and its wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A useful conversion factor for this calculation is hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the wavelength: λ = hc/E.\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light:** Based on the calculated wavelength, we will identify its color within the visible light spectrum.\n3.  **Find the complementary color:** The color of light that a substance absorbs is complementary to the color it emits or transmits. We will use a color wheel principle to find the color complementary to the emitted light. This complementary color is the color of the absorbed light.\n4.  **Match the result with the given options:** We will compare our calculated absorbed color with the provided choices to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_color_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the absorbed color of a dye based on its emitted light energy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define constants and calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.\n    # Energy of the emitted light in electron-volts (eV).\n    energy_emitted_eV = 2.3393\n    # A useful constant: product of Planck's constant and the speed of light, hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n    hc_eV_nm = 1240\n    \n    # Formula: wavelength = hc / Energy\n    wavelength_emitted_nm = hc_eV_nm / energy_emitted_eV\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the color of the emitted light from its wavelength.\n    emitted_color = \"\"\n    if 380 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 450:\n        emitted_color = \"Violet\"\n    elif 450 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 495:\n        emitted_color = \"Blue\"\n    elif 495 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 570:\n        emitted_color = \"Green\"\n    elif 570 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 590:\n        emitted_color = \"Yellow\"\n    elif 590 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 620:\n        emitted_color = \"Orange\"\n    elif 620 <= wavelength_emitted_nm <= 750:\n        emitted_color = \"Red\"\n    else:\n        emitted_color = \"Outside Visible Spectrum\"\n\n    # Step 3: Find the complementary (absorbed) color.\n    complementary_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"Green\",\n        \"Orange\": \"Blue\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"Violet\",\n        \"Green\": \"Red\",\n        \"Blue\": \"Orange\",\n        \"Violet\": \"Yellow\"\n    }\n    absorbed_color = complementary_map.get(emitted_color, \"Unknown\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The energy of the emitted light is {energy_emitted_eV} eV.\")\n    print(f\"The calculated wavelength of the emitted light is {wavelength_emitted_nm:.2f} nm.\")\n    print(f\"A wavelength of {wavelength_emitted_nm:.2f} nm corresponds to the color {emitted_color}.\")\n    print(f\"The absorbed color is complementary to the emitted color ({emitted_color}).\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the absorbed color is {absorbed_color}.\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\n    print(\"A) Violet\")\n    print(\"B) Red\")\n    print(\"C) Yellow\")\n    print(\"D) Blue\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct option is B, which is {absorbed_color}.\")\n\nsolve_color_problem()\n<<<B>>>"
