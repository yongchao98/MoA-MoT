    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the System:** We are dealing with four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, since these particles are fermions, no two of them can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state here is defined by both its energy level (quantum number `n`) and its spin (up or down).\n2.  **Energy Levels of a Single Particle:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines the base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the energy for the n-th level is `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n3.  **State Occupancy:** Because of the spin-1/2 nature, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n4.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_ground):** To find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first.\n    *   The n=1 level can hold two particles. Their total energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n    *   The remaining two particles must go into the next lowest level, n=2. Their total energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `2E + 8E = 10E`.\n5.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_first):** To get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   Ground state configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n    *   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   New configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   The total energy is: `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n6.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_second):** This is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possibilities of exciting the system from the ground state.\n    *   **Option 1:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. Configuration: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * 1^2 E) + (2 * 2^2 E) + (1 * 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Option 2:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: two in n=1, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 E) + (2 * 3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Option 3:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. Configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 E) + (1 * 2^2 E) + (1 * 4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   Comparing these energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy above the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Thus, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n7.  **Final Result:** The energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# The base energy unit E is defined as (pi^2 * h-bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n# The energy of a single particle in the nth state is En = n^2 * E\n\n# We have 4 identical spin-1/2 particles (fermions).\n# By the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level 'n' can hold at most 2 particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\n# --- Ground State ---\n# To find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels.\n# Level n=1 can hold 2 particles.\n# Level n=2 can hold the other 2 particles.\nE_ground = 2 * (1**2) + 2 * (2**2) # Energy in units of E\n\n# --- First Excited State ---\n# To find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2)\n# to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\nE_first = 2 * (1**2) + 1 * (2**2) + 1 * (3**2)\n\n# --- Second Excited State ---\n# This is the next possible energy configuration with the minimum energy increase.\n# We compare the energies of the next possible excitations from the ground state.\n# Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n# Config: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\nE_second_A = 1 * (1**2) + 2 * (2**2) + 1 * (3**2)\n\n# Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n# Config: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\nE_second_B = 2 * (1**2) + 2 * (3**2)\n\n# Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n# Config: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\nE_second_C = 2 * (1**2) + 1 * (2**2) + 1 * (4**2)\n\n# The second excited state is the one with the lowest energy among these possibilities,\n# which must be greater than the first excited state's energy.\nE_second = min(E_second_A, E_second_B, E_second_C)\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"The energy of the ground state is {E_ground}E.\")\nprint(f\"The energy of the first excited state is {E_first}E.\")\nprint(f\"The energy of the second excited state is {E_second}E.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4E, 10E, 50E\")\nprint(\"B) 10E, 15E, 18E\")\nprint(\"C) 4E, 10E, 15E\")\nprint(\"D) 30E, 39E, 50E\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option B.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
