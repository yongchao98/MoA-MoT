    "This problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) that can annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($E_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair. This process, $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, is a classic example of pair production and is governed by the principles of special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle**: For the reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two colliding photons must be at least equal to the combined rest mass energy of the products, which are an electron and a positron. Since they have the same mass, this is twice the rest mass energy of an electron ($2m_e c^2$).\n\n2.  **Determine the optimal condition for the threshold energy**: The threshold energy corresponds to the minimum energy required for the gamma-ray. This minimum is achieved when the collision is most efficient, which is a head-on collision (the photons travel towards each other at an angle of 180 degrees).\n\n3.  **Use the threshold energy formula**: For a head-on collision between a high-energy photon ($E_\\gamma$) and a low-energy photon ($E_{CMB}$), the threshold condition is given by the equation:\n    $4E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n4.  **Define the constants**:\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is approximately $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB}$, is given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n\n5.  **Calculate the energy**: We will use a Python script to plug these values into the formula to calculate $E_\\gamma$. The result will be in electron-volts (eV), which we will then convert to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), since 1 GeV = $10^9$ eV.\n\n```python\n# Constants\n# Rest mass energy of an electron in eV\nm_e_c2 = 0.511 * 1e6  # 0.511 MeV\n\n# Average energy of a CMB photon in eV\nE_CMB = 1e-3\n\n# The formula for the threshold energy of the gamma-ray is derived from the\n# conservation of four-momentum, E_gamma = (m_e*c^2)^2 / E_CMB.\n# This formula applies for a head-on collision, which gives the minimum\n# required energy for the gamma-ray.\n\n# Calculate the threshold energy in eV\nE_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2**2) / E_CMB\n\n# Convert the energy from eV to GeV (1 GeV = 1e9 eV)\nE_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / 1e9\n\n# The given options are:\n# A) 2.6*1e5 GeV\n# B) 1.8*1e5 GeV\n# C) 3.9*1e5 GeV\n# D) 9.5*1e4 GeV\n\n# Print the calculated threshold energy\nprint(f\"The rest mass energy of an electron (m_e*c^2) is {m_e_c2:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"The average energy of a CMB photon (E_CMB) is {E_CMB:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated threshold gamma-ray energy is {E_gamma_GeV:.2e} GeV.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) {2.6e5:.2e} GeV\")\nprint(f\"B) {1.8e5:.2e} GeV\")\nprint(f\"C) {3.9e5:.2e} GeV\")\nprint(f\"D) {9.5e4:.2e} GeV\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value most closely matches option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
