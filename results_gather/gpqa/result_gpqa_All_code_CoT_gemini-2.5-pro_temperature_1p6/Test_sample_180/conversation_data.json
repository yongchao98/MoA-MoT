    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two adjacent energy bands, `Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV)`. The crucial condition is that the pp-III reaction chain in the Sun stopped producing neutrinos 8.5 minutes ago. The 8.5-minute delay is the travel time for neutrinos (and light) from the Sun to Earth, meaning we on Earth would observe the effects of this stoppage *right now*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"pp-III Stop\" Condition:** The pp-III chain is responsible for producing high-energy Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos. These neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. If this branch stops, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos reaching Earth becomes zero.\n\n3.  **Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Energy Band (Post-Stoppage):**\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: Their maximum energy is ~420 keV, so they don't contribute.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: They would normally contribute, but their production has stopped. So, zero contribution.\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: These have a sharp energy line at 861 keV, which is outside this band. So, zero contribution.\n        *   **CNO neutrinos:** Neutrinos from the CNO cycle (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) have continuous spectra that extend into this energy range. This is the *only* source of flux in Band 1.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: No contribution.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: No contribution.\n        *   **`⁷Be` neutrinos:** The pp-II branch, which produces `⁷Be` neutrinos, is still active. These neutrinos are mono-energetic at 861 keV, which falls directly and entirely within this band. This will be a *massive* contribution.\n        *   **CNO neutrinos:** Their continuous spectra also contribute a small amount to this band.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes:**\n    *   **Flux in Band 2:** This is completely dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrino flux. The standard solar model puts the total flux of these neutrinos at approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second. The contribution from the CNO neutrinos in this narrow band is orders of magnitude smaller and can be considered negligible for an approximate calculation. So, `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux(⁷Be)`.\n    *   **Flux in Band 1:** This flux comes solely from the CNO cycle. The total flux from the relevant CNO reactions is about 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second. However, this total flux is spread across a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV). We are only interested in a small 100 keV slice of that spectrum. We can estimate this fraction. A rough approximation is to divide the total CNO flux by the total energy range and multiply by our band's width (100 keV = 0.1 MeV).\n\n5.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   `Flux_2 ≈ Total Flux of ⁷Be neutrinos ≈ 5 x 10⁹`\n    *   `Flux_1 ≈ (Total CNO Flux / CNO Energy Range) * Bandwidth ≈ (5 x 10⁸ / 1.7 MeV) * 0.1 MeV`\n    *   `Ratio = Flux_1 / Flux_2`\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:** This calculation will be performed in the Python code below. The expected result is a small number, as a tiny fraction of the CNO flux is being compared to the entire `⁷Be` flux. The result should be approximately 0.006, which is very close to 0.01 (10⁻²). This points to option A as the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_neutrino_flux_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the approximate ratio of solar neutrino fluxes in two energy bands,\n    assuming the pp-III branch has stopped.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the baseline fluxes from the Standard Solar Model.\n    # We only need the sources that are still active and relevant to our energy bands.\n    \n    # The pp-II branch produces ⁷Be neutrinos.
