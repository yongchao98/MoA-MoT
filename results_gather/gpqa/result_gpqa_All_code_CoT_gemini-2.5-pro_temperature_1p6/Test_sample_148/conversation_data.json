    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The problem states that both peaks observed in the LC-MS have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This means the two compounds are isomers—they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass. This observation immediately allows us to rule out options that involve a change in mass.\n    *   **Option A (Double coupling):** This would result in a larger molecule with a higher mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option B (Contamination with a precursor):** A precursor would be a different molecule, almost certainly with a different (likely lower) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **Distinguish Between Remaining Isomers (Enantiomers vs. Diastereoisomers):** We are left with Option C (enantiomers) and Option D (diastereoisomers). We must use the NMR and LC data to distinguish between them.\n\n3.  **Analyze the NMR and LC Data:**\n    *   **Enantiomers** are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Standard NMR and standard LC (using an achiral column) are achiral techniques. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would produce a single set of peaks in an NMR spectrum and a single peak in a standard LC chromatogram.\n    *   **Diastereoisomers** are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment. Because of these differences:\n        *   They are distinguishable by NMR, meaning a mixture of diastereoisomers will show two distinct sets of peaks.\n        *   They can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography, meaning a mixture will show two distinct peaks in the LC chromatogram.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The experimental observations—two NMR peaks for the same proton and two separable peaks in the LC—perfectly match the expected behavior of a mixture of diastereoisomers. The compound existing as a mixture of enantiomers is inconsistent with these observations.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spectroscopic_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the nature of the synthesized peptide.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Evaluate the Mass Spectrometry (MS) data.\n    # The problem states both observed LC peaks have the same mass, which matches the expected molecule.\n    # This means the two species are isomers.\n    # This rules out 'double coupling' (different mass) and 'precursor contamination' (different mass).\n    reasoning_ms = \"MS data shows both species have the same mass as the target molecule, indicating they are isomers.
