    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles.** The mean decay distance (or length) $L$ of a relativistic particle is given by the product of its velocity $v$ and its mean lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$. So, $L = v\\tau$.\n2.  **Apply time dilation.** The lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is dilated with respect to the particle's proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$. The relation is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n3.  **Relate lifetime to decay width.** The proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ is inversely proportional to the decay width $\\Gamma$ via the uncertainty principle: $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n4.  **Combine the formulas.** Substituting the expressions for $\\tau$ and $\\tau_0$ into the formula for $L$, we get $L = v \\gamma (\\hbar/\\Gamma)$.\n5.  **Simplify the expression.** The product $v\\gamma$ can be expressed in terms of the particle's momentum $p$ and mass $m$. From the definition of relativistic momentum $p = \\gamma m v$, we get $v\\gamma = p/m$. This simplifies the formula for the decay distance to $L = (p/m) \\cdot (\\hbar/\\Gamma)$.\n6.  **Use convenient units.** For calculation purposes in particle physics, it is convenient to work with energy units (like MeV) and the constant $\\hbar c$. We can rewrite the formula as $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$. This form is easy to compute as all terms are given in or can be calculated in units of MeV.\n7.  **Calculate the momentum.** The term $pc$ (momentum multiplied by the speed of light) can be calculated from the given total energy $E_X$ and mass $m_X$ using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. Thus, $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n8.  **Substitute the values and compute.** We will plug in the given values for $E_X$, $m_X$, and $\\Gamma_X$, along with the known value of $\\hbar c$, to find the final decay distance $L$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Description of the task and plan.\n# We are asked to calculate the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n# The plan is as follows:\n# 1. Use the formula for the mean decay length of a relativistic particle: L = (p/m) * (hbar/Gamma).\n# 2. To facilitate calculation, rewrite the formula as L = (p*c / (m*c^2)) * (hbar*c / Gamma).\n# 3. Calculate the momentum term p*c using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n# 4. Convert all units to a consistent system (MeV for energy).\n# 5.
