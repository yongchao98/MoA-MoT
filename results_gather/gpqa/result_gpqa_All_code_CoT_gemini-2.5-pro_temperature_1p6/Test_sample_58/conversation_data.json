    "To determine the pH of the mixed solution, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles** of each reactant: the weak acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (HCl), and the strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n2.  **Account for dissociation:** Determine the moles of H+ ions from the strong acid and OH- ions from the strong base. Note that Ba(OH)2 releases two OH- ions per formula unit.\n3.  **Perform neutralization reactions:** First, the strong acid (H+) will react with the strong base (OH-).\n4.  **React the remainder:** The excess reactant from the first neutralization (in this case, OH-) will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n5.  **Determine the final composition:** After all reactions, we identify the major species remaining in the solution that will determine its pH.\n6.  **Calculate the final pH:** Based on the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-), we calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH. The total volume will be the sum of the volumes of the three initial solutions.\n\nThe following Python code executes these steps to find the final pH.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial values and calculate moles\n# Volume in Liters, Concentration in Moles/Liter\nvol_ch3cooh = 0.500\nconc_ch3cooh = 0.1\nmoles_ch3cooh = vol_ch3cooh * conc_ch3cooh\n\nvol_hcl = 0.400\nconc_hcl = 0.2\nmoles_hcl = vol_hcl * conc_hcl\n\nvol_baoh2 = 0.300\nconc_baoh2 = 0.3\nmoles_baoh2 = vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of H+ from strong acid and OH- from strong base\n# HCl is a strong acid: HCl -> H+ + Cl-\nmoles_h_plus_strong = moles_hcl\n# Ba(OH)2 is a strong base: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-\nmoles_oh_minus_strong = 2 * moles_baoh2\n\n# Step 3: Neutralize strong acid with strong base\n# H+ + OH- -> H2O\n# We compare the moles of H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2\nmoles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction = moles_oh_minus_strong - moles_h_plus_strong\n\n# Step 4: React the remaining strong base with the weak acid\n# CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n# The remaining OH- will react with the available CH3COOH\nmoles_oh_final_excess = moles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 5: Calculate final concentration of OH-\n# Total volume is the sum of the individual volumes\ntotal_volume = vol_ch3cooh + vol_hcl + vol_baoh2\nfinal_conc_oh = moles_oh_final_excess / total_volume\n\n# Step 6: Calculate pOH and pH\n# pOH = -log10[OH-]\npOH = -math.log10(final_conc_oh)\n# pH = 14 - pOH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\n# Print the final calculated pH and the given choices\nprint(f\"The calculated pH of the final solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\nprint(\"Which of the following choices is correct?\")\nprint(f\"A) 8.68\")\nprint(f\"B) 8.92\")\nprint(f\"C) 12.62\")\nprint(f\"D) 1.38\")\n<<<C>>>\n```"
