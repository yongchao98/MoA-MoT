    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves a relativistic particle that decays. We need to use concepts from special relativity (time dilation, relativistic energy) and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n2.  **Define \"Observing a Decay\":** In a particle detector, a decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($L_{res}$) before it decays. The decay vertex can then be distinguished from the production vertex.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Condition:** The problem states we need to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\". This means the fraction of particles that travel a distance $L > L_{res}$ must be at least 0.30. The number of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance $L$ in the lab frame is given by the decay law: $N(L) = N_0 e^{-L/L_{mean}}$, where $L_{mean}$ is the mean decay length in the lab.\n    Therefore, the condition is:\n    $N(L_{res}) / N_0 \\geq 0.30$\n    $e^{-L_{res}/L_{mean}} \\geq 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-L_{res}/L_{mean} \\geq \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L_{res} \\leq -L_{mean} \\ln(0.30)$\n    The question asks for the minimum resolution required, which corresponds to the maximum allowed value for $L_{res}$ from this inequality. So, we will calculate $L_{res} = -L_{mean} \\ln(0.30)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{mean}$):**\n    The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by $L_{mean} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\n    This can be calculated more directly using the particle's energy ($E$) and rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$):\n    $L_{mean} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n    where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the given values ($E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s) into the formula for $L_{mean}$.\n    *   Use the calculated $L_{mean}$ to find the required resolution $L_{res}$.\n    *   Compare the final result with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\ndecay_fraction_to_observe = 0.3\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the mean decay length (L_mean) in the lab frame.\n# The formula is L_mean = (sqrt(E^2 - (m0c2)^2) / m0c2) * c * tau0\n# The term sqrt(E^2 - m0c2^2) is the momentum times c (pc).\n# The term (pc / m0c2) is equivalent to beta*gamma.\nfactor = math.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2) / m0c2\nL_mean = factor * c * tau0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the minimum resolution (L_res).\n# The fraction of particles that decay after a distance L_res is exp(-L_res / L_mean).\n# We want this fraction to be at least 30% (0.3).\n# exp(-L_res / L_mean) = 0.3\n# L_res = -L_mean * ln(0.3)\nL_res = -L_mean * math.log(decay_fraction_to_observe)\n\n# The options provided\noption_A = \"2.08*1e-9 m\"\noption_B = \"2.08*1e-3 m\"\noption_C = \"2.08*1e-1 m\"\noption_D = \"2.08*1e-6 m\"\nvalue_D = 2.08e-6\n\nprint(f\"The total energy E is {E} GeV.\")\nprint(f\"The rest mass energy m0c^2 is {m0c2} GeV.\")\nprint(f\"The proper lifetime tau0 is {tau0} s.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay length in the lab frame is {L_mean:.4e} m.\")\nprint(f\"The fraction of decays to be observed is at least {decay_fraction_to_observe}.\")\nprint(f\"The required resolution is L_res = -L_mean * ln({decay_fraction_to_observe}).\")\nprint(f\"The calculated minimum resolution is {L_res:.4e} m.\")\n\n# Comparing the result with the options.\n# Our calculated result is ~2.27e-6 m, which is closest to option D.\n# The small discrepancy might be due to a typo in the problem's given values.\n# However, based on the calculation, option D is the only physically plausible answer.\nprint(\"\\nComparing the calculated result with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) {option_A}\")\nprint(f\"B) {option_B}\")\nprint(f\"C) {option_C}\")\nprint(f\"D) {option_D}\")\nprint(f\"Our calculated value {L_res:.2e} m is closest in magnitude to option D.\")\nprint(\"Final Answer is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
