    "The user wants me to solve a multiple-choice biology question using a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Biology:** The core of the question is to identify the reason why Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) has a milder phenotype than Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21).\n    *   **Klinefelter's Syndrome (XXY):** An extra sex chromosome.\n    *   **Down's Syndrome (Trisomy 21):** An extra autosome.\n    *   **The Key Difference:** In mammals, there is a mechanism called **X-chromosome inactivation** (lyonization) to equalize the dosage of X-linked genes between sexes. In cells with more than one X chromosome, all but one are randomly inactivated early in embryonic development. This inactive X chromosome becomes a highly condensed Barr body.\n    *   **Mechanism of Inactivation:** This is an epigenetic process involving changes to chromatin structure, including DNA methylation and histone modifications (like methylation performed by histone methyltransferases).\n    *   **Consequence:** In an XXY individual, one of the X chromosomes is inactivated, meaning the gene dosage from the extra chromosome is largely silenced. This significantly lessens the phenotypic impact.\n    *   **Comparison to Down's Syndrome:** There is no equivalent large-scale inactivation mechanism for autosomes. In Trisomy 21, all three copies of the chromosome are active, leading to a significant overexpression of genes on chromosome 21, which causes the more severe phenotype associated with Down's syndrome.\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) & C):** These describe processes in meiosis. Errors here can *cause* the aneuploidies but do not explain the *difference in symptom severity* after fertilization.\n    *   **B):** DNA polymerase is involved in replication, a general process not specific to the difference between these two syndromes.\n    *   **D):** \"Chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote\" accurately describes the molecular basis of X-chromosome inactivation, which happens after fertilization (post-zygote) and is the direct reason for the milder phenotype in Klinefelter's syndrome. This is the correct answer.\n3.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The script will first state the question and the options.\n    *   It will then provide a detailed explanation of why option D is correct, referencing X-chromosome inactivation and comparing it to the situation in Down's syndrome.\n    *   Finally, it will print the correct option letter.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the question about Klinefelter's and Down's syndrome,\n    explains the underlying biological mechanism, and prints the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I',\n        'B': 'progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst',\n        'C': 'chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis',\n        'D': 'chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote'\n    }\n\n    print(\"### Biology Question Analysis ###\\n\")\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"Options:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"  {key}) {value}\")\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The question asks why the symptoms of Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) are less severe than those of Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21). The answer lies in a dosage compensation mechanism specific to sex chromosomes.\n\n    1.  **Klinefelter's Syndrome vs. Down's Syndrome:** Klinefelter's is a sex chromosome aneuploidy (XXY), while Down's is an autosomal aneuploidy (three copies of chromosome 21).\n\n    2.  **X-Chromosome Inactivation (Lyonization):** In mammals, to balance the genetic dose between males (XY) and females (XX), one of the two X chromosomes in females is largely inactivated early in embryonic development (post-zygote). This process also occurs in individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome, where one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated. The inactivated X chromosome condenses into a compact structure called a Barr body.\n\n    3.  **The Molecular Mechanism:** This inactivation is an epigenetic phenomenon. It involves profound changes to the chromatin structure of the chromosome to be silenced. Key among these changes are DNA methylation and histone modifications, including the methylation of histone proteins by enzymes called histone methyltransferases. These modifications silence gene expression on that chromosome.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion:** Because the extra X chromosome in an XXY individual is mostly silenced, the gene dosage is largely normalized. In contrast, for Down's syndrome, there is no such inactivation mechanism for autosome 21. All three copies remain active, leading to a ~50% overexpression of its genes, resulting in a more severe and wide-ranging phenotype. Therefore, chromatin methylation as part of X-inactivation is the correct mechanism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"\\n### Explanation ###\")\n    # Use textwrap to format the explanation nicely\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation))\n\n    correct_answer_key = 'D'\n    print(\"\\n### Final Answer ###\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {correct_answer_key}\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer\nsolve_biology_question()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
