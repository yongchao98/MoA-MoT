    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve this problem, which involves the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns and Constants:** We are given the spacecraft's speed (v), the astronaut's age, and the alien species' average lifetime. We need to determine the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is the starting point. The distance to the LMC is not fixed to a single number, but a common astronomical estimate is around 159,000 light-years. We will use this value for our calculation.\n2.  **Calculate Time in Earth's Frame of Reference (Δt):** First, we'll calculate how long the journey takes from the perspective of an observer on Earth. This is found by dividing the distance by the speed of the spacecraft.\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** Time dilation is governed by the Lorentz factor, which depends on the spacecraft's speed. The formula is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). A higher speed results in a larger Lorentz factor and more significant time dilation.\n4.  **Calculate Time in Astronaut's Frame of Reference (Δt₀):** This is the time the astronaut actually experiences, also known as proper time. It's calculated by dividing the time measured on Earth by the Lorentz factor (Δt₀ = Δt / γ).\n5.  **Check for Survival:** We will add the calculated travel time to the astronaut's starting age to see if they complete the journey within their 150-year lifespan.\n6.  **Select the Answer:** We will compare our calculated result with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nNow, let's execute this plan using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and known values\n# Speed of the spacecraft as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\nv_c_ratio = 0.99999987\n# Distance from Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth in light-years\n# Note: This is a standard astronomical estimate that aligns with the problem's options.\ndistance_light_years = 159000\n# Astronaut's age at the start of the journey\nastronaut_age_start = 22\n# Average lifespan of the alien species\nalien_lifespan = 150\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the journey time from Earth's perspective\n# Time = Distance / Speed. Since distance is in light-years and speed is a fraction of c,\n# the time will be in years.\ntime_on_earth = distance_light_years / v_c_ratio\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_c_ratio**2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the journey time from the astronaut's perspective (proper time)\ntime_for_astronaut = time_on_earth / gamma\n\n# Step 5: Check if the astronaut survives the journey\nage_at_arrival = astronaut_age_start + time_for_astronaut\nsurvives = age_at_arrival < alien_lifespan\n\n# Step 6: Print the results and the choice\nprint(f\"The journey will take approximately {time_for_astronaut:.2f} years from the astronaut's point of view.\")\nif survives:\n    print(f\"The astronaut's age upon arrival would be {age_at_arrival:.2f} years, which is within the 150-year lifespan.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the astronaut survives the trip. Option A is incorrect.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The astronaut will not survive the trip. Option A is correct.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing the calculated time with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth. (Incorrect, as {time_for_astronaut:.2f} years is survivable)\")\nprint(f\"B) 77 years\")\nprint(f\"C) 81 years (The calculated time of {time_for_astronaut:.2f} years is closest to this option)\")\nprint(f\"D) 72 years\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final choice is C.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
