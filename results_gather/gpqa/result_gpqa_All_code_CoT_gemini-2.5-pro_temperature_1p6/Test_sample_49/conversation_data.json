    "In quantum field theory calculations, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the power of the `4π` factor that appears in the final expression for the amplitude. Specifically, in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral typically introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` into the calculation after performing the angular part of the momentum integration.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the loop-dependent factor in the given expression: `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`. The relevant term is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n2.  Let `L` be the number of loops. The total loop factor is given by `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/((4π)^(2L))`.\n3.  By comparing this general formula to the term in the expression, we can set the exponents equal: `2 * L = 6`.\n4.  Solve this simple equation for `L` to find the number of loops.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan.\n\n```python\n# The expression for the size estimate of the Feynman diagram is:\n# alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2\n\n# In 4D quantum field theory, each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2.\n# Let L be the number of loops. The total loop factor is (1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2*L).\n\n# From the expression, we see the factor is 1/(4pi)^6.\n# So, we can equate the exponents: 2 * L = 6.\n\n# The exponent of the (4pi) term from the note.\ntotal_exponent = 6\n\n# The exponent contributed by a single loop.\nexponent_per_loop = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of loops.\nnumber_of_loops = total_exponent / exponent_per_loop\n\nprint(f\"The mathematical expression contains the term 1/(4pi)^{total_exponent}.\")\nprint(f\"Since each loop in the diagram contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^{exponent_per_loop}, we can find the number of loops (L) by solving the equation 2 * L = {total_exponent}.\")\nprint(f\"Solving for L: L = {total_exponent} / {exponent_per_loop} = {int(number_of_loops)}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the Feynman diagram contained {int(number_of_loops)} loops.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nMatching with the choices:\")\nprint(\"A) 6\")\nprint(\"B) 3\")\nprint(\"C) 1\")\nprint(\"D) 2\")\nprint(\"\\nThe result corresponds to choice B.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
