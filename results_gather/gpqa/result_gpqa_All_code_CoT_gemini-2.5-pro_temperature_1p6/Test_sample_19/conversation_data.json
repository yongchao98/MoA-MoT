    "The \"impulse approximation\" is a foundational concept in nuclear physics used to simplify the complex problem of an external probe (like an electron or a neutrino) interacting with a nucleus composed of many nucleons (protons and neutrons). The goal is to treat the interaction as if it happens with a single, free nucleon, ignoring the complexities of the surrounding nuclear environment.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine which assumptions are necessary for this approximation:\n1.  **Analyze Assumption 1:** \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\" This is the very definition of the \"impulse\" or \"single-nucleon\" picture. We assume the probe hits just one nucleon, not multiple nucleons at the same time (which would be a \"meson-exchange current\"). This assumption is essential.\n2.  **Analyze Assumption 2:** \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\" This addresses what happens before and after the main interaction. If the incoming probe or the outgoing particles were to interact with other nucleons, the final state would be distorted (these are called initial and final-state interactions). To keep the picture simple and treat the event as an isolated one, we must assume the rest of the nucleus is transparent. This assumption is essential.\n3.  **Analyze Assumption 3:** \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\" This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is about the behavior of the nucleon *as a whole particle* within the nucleus, not the behavior of its constituent quarks. In fact, many experiments where this approximation is used involve high energies where the quarks are decidedly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n4.  **Analyze Assumption 4:** \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\" For a nucleon to be treated as \"free,\" we must neglect the forces that bind it to the nucleus. The idea is that the interaction is an \"impulse\"â€”it happens so quickly that the relatively slow-acting binding forces don't have time to affect the process. This assumption is essential.\n\nBased on this analysis, the necessary assumptions are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_impulse_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the assumptions of the impulse approximation in nuclear physics\n    and identifies the correct set of assumptions from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the assumptions for the 'impulse approximation':\")\n\n    # The assumptions provided in the problem\n    assumptions = {\n        1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\",\n        2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\",\n        3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\",\n        4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"\n    }\n\n    # The options provided in the problem\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"2,3,4\",\n        \"B\": \"1,2,3\",\n        \"C\": \"1,3,4\",\n        \"D\": \"1,2,4\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step-by-step Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Assumption 1: (Interacts with individual nucleons) is REQUIRED.
