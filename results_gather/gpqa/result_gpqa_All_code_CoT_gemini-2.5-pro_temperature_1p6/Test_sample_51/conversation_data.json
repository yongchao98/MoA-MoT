    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem asks for the ratio of the populations of two atomic energy levels (N_level2 / N_level1) under different temperature conditions. Since the problem specifies that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the appropriate formula to use is the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n    N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where N_i is the number of atoms in level i, g_i is the statistical weight, ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Unspotted Star:** Temperature T_unspotted = 6000 K.\n    *   **Spotted Star:** Temperature T_spotted = 5500 K.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio for Each Scenario:**\n    *   Ratio_unspotted = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted))\n    *   Ratio_spotted = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))\n\n4.  **Formulate the Desired Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of the two ratios calculated above:\n\n    Factor = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:** When we divide the two expressions, the statistical weight term (g_2 / g_1) cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b)), the expression simplifies to:\n\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted) + ΔE / (k * T_spotted))\n    Factor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) )\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). We use the formula:\n\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n\n    where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Combine and Compute:** By substituting the expression for ΔE into our factor equation, we can calculate the final numerical answer using the provided physical constants and temperatures. Note that extraneous information like the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is not needed for this specific calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23    # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Define the parameters from the problem\n# Temperature of the star without spots\nT_unspotted = 6000  # in Kelvin\n# Temperature of the star with spots\nT_spotted = 5500  # in Kelvin\n# Wavelength of the transition in Angstroms\nlambda_A = 1448\n# Convert wavelength to meters\nlambda_m = lambda_A * 1e-10\n\n# Calculate the energy difference between the two levels (delta_E)\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations is R = (g2/g1) * exp(-delta_E / (k*T))\n# We need to find the factor F = R_unspotted / R_spotted\n# F = [exp(-delta_E / (k*T_unspotted))] / [exp(-delta_E / (k*T_spotted))]\n# F = exp( (delta_E / k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) )\n\n# Calculate the exponent term\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = math.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(\"The factor by which the ratio of populations changes is calculated below.\")\nprint(f\"Temperature without spots (T_unspotted): {T_unspotted} K\")\nprint(f\"Temperature with spots (T_spotted): {T_spotted} K\")\nprint(f\"Wavelength of transition: {lambda_A} Å\")\nprint(f\"Calculated factor: {factor:.2f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~1.1\")\nprint(f\"B) ~2.9\")\nprint(f\"C) ~7.8\")\nprint(f\"D) ~4.5\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option D.\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```"
