    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the governing physical law:** The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV`. The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) is the perfect tool for this, as it relates this volume integral to a surface integral: `∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮ (f ⋅ dS)`.\n2.  **Define the field and the surface:**\n    *   The vector field is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n3.  **Set up the surface integral:**\n    *   The surface integral `∮ (f ⋅ dS)` represents the total flux of the field `f` out of the sphere.\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field `f` has a magnitude of `1/R^2`. Its direction is radial (outward).\n    *   The differential surface area vector `dS` for a sphere also points radially outward.\n    *   Therefore, the dot product `f ⋅ dS` simplifies to `|f| * |dS|`, which is `(1/R^2) * dA`, where `dA` is the scalar surface area element.\n4.  **Calculate the integral:**\n    *   The integral becomes `∮ (1/R^2) dA`.\n    *   Since `R` is constant over the surface of the sphere, we can factor `1/R^2` out of the integral: `(1/R^2) * ∮ dA`.\n    *   The integral `∮ dA` is simply the total surface area of the sphere.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4 * π * R^2`.\n5.  **Compute the final result:**\n    *   Multiplying the terms: `(1/R^2) * (4 * π * R^2)`. The `R^2` terms cancel out, leaving a result of `4π`.\n6.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value `4π` matches option D. The Python code below will formalize this calculation.\n\nNote: Although the field has a singularity at `r=0`, which is inside the volume, the Divergence Theorem works beautifully here. The divergence `∇ ⋅ f` is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a Dirac delta function. The integral of this delta function over the volume (which contains the origin) yields exactly `4π`. The surface integral calculation correctly captures this \"charge\" at the origin.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Use the Divergence Theorem, which states that the volume integral of the divergence\n#    is equal to the surface integral (flux) of the field over the enclosing surface.\n#    Volume Integral = ∮ (f ⋅ dS)\n# 2. The field f on the surface of the sphere (radius R) has magnitude 1/R^2.\n# 3. The surface element dS is also radial, so the dot product f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) dA.\n# 4. The integral is (1/R^2) * (Total Surface Area of the sphere).\n# 5. The surface area of a sphere is 4 * π * R^2.\n# 6. The final result is (1/R^2) * (4 * π * R^2) = 4π.\n\n# In Python, we can represent this calculation.\n# Although the radius R is a symbolic variable, it cancels out.\n# We can demonstrate this by assigning a dummy value for R.\nR = 5 # Any positive value for R would yield the same result.\n\n# Magnitude of the field on the surface\nfield_magnitude_on_surface = 1 / (R**2)\n\n# Surface area of the sphere\nsurface_area = 4 * math.pi * (R**2)\n\n# The integral is the product of the field's magnitude (projected on the normal) and the area\n# As the field is normal to the surface, the calculation is direct.\nintegral_result = field_magnitude_on_surface * surface_area\n\nprint(\"The volume integral of the divergence of the field is calculated using the Divergence Theorem.\")\nprint(\"This equals the flux of the field through the surface of the sphere.\")\nprint(f\"For a sphere of radius R, the flux is (1/R^2) * (Surface Area) = (1/R^2) * (4 * pi * R^2).\")\nprint(\"The R^2 terms cancel, leaving 4 * pi.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculated answer:\")\nprint(integral_result)\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the given choices:\")\nprint(f\"A) 4/3 π R = {4/3 * math.pi * R}\")\nprint(f\"B) 0\")\nprint(f\"C) 1\")\nprint(f\"D) 4 π = {4 * math.pi}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe result matches choice D.\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
