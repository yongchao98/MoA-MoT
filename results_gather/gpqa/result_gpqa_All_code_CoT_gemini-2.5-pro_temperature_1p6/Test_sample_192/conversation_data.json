    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe goal is to find how the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) varies with distance (`r`).\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Information:**\n*   We are told that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This is best interpreted as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, so `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n*   We know the fundamental relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`): `plx = 1/r`.\n\n**3. Formulate a Plan:**\nWe can find the desired quantity `dN/dr` by using the chain rule from calculus, which relates the derivatives with respect to different variables:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n**4. Execute the Plan:**\n*   **First part `(dN/d(plx))`:** We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. We need to express this in terms of distance `r`. By substituting `plx = 1/r`, we get `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5`.\n\n*   **Second part `(d(plx)/dr)`:** We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`.\n    Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, the derivative is `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`.\n\n*   **Combine using the chain rule:** Now, we multiply the two parts.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r²) = -r³`\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r³`. The negative sign is related to the direction of change, but the dependence on `r` is `r³`. This matches option B.\n\n```python\n# Title: Deriving Star Count vs. Distance Relationship\n\n# This script explains the step-by-step derivation for the problem.\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.
