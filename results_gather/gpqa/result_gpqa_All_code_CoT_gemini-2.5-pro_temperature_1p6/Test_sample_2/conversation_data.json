    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the quantum state**: The state `|ψ⟩` is given as `0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`. In the standard basis where `|↑⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|↓⟩ = [0, 1]`, this state can be represented by the column vector `[0.5, √3/2]`.\n2.  **Define the operators**: The Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` are represented by 2x2 matrices in the same basis.\n    *   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n3.  **Construct the full operator**: The operator whose expectation value we need is `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. We will calculate this by performing the matrix addition and scalar multiplication.\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value**: The expectation value `⟨O⟩` is calculated using the formula `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. This involves a matrix-vector product `O|ψ⟩` followed by an inner product with `⟨ψ|`. In numerical terms, if `psi` is the state vector and `O_matrix` is the operator matrix, the expectation value is `psi_conjugate_transpose * O_matrix * psi`.\n5.  **Round the result**: The final numerical answer needs to be rounded to one decimal place as requested.\n6.  **Compare with options**: Match the calculated value with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the quantum state vector\n# The state is |ψ> = 0.5|↑> + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓>\n# In vector form [c_up, c_down]\npsi = np.array([0.5, np.sqrt(3)/2])\n\n# Step 2: Define the Pauli matrices\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], \n                    [0, -1]])\n\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], \n                    [1, 0]])\n\n# Step 3: Construct the full operator O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x\noperator_O = 10 * sigma_z + 5 * sigma_x\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the expectation value <ψ|O|ψ>\n# This is calculated as (psi^dagger) * O * psi\n# Since psi is real, psi^dagger is just its transpose.\n# In numpy, '@' is the matrix multiplication operator.\nexpectation_value = psi.conj().T @ operator_O @ psi\n\n# Step 5: Round the result to one decimal place\nrounded_expectation_value = round(expectation_value, 1)\n\n# Step 6: Print the result and options\nprint(\"The spin-half particle is in the state: |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩\")\nprint(\"The operator is O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x\")\nprint(f\"The calculated expectation value <ψ|O|ψ> is: {expectation_value}\")\nprint(f\"The value rounded to one decimal place is: {rounded_expectation_value}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) -1.4\")\nprint(\"B) -0.7\")\nprint(\"C) 0.85\")\nprint(\"D) 1.65\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
