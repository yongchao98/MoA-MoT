    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to calculate its mole fraction relative to all other cobalt-containing species in the solution. The total concentration of cobalt `c(Co)` is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define Species**: The cobalt-containing species are the free ion `Co^2+` and the complexes `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`.\n2.  **Use Stability Constants (β)**: The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n3.  **Calculate the Distribution Function (Φ)**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` can be written by factoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n    The term in the parenthesis is the distribution function, let's call it Φ.\n4.  **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α)**: The fraction of a specific complex, like `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co) = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * Φ)`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, so the fraction `α2` is independent of the total cobalt concentration and only depends on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants.\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n5.  **Calculate the Percentage**: We will plug in the given values (`[SCN-]` = 0.1 M, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16), calculate `α2`, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given concentration of thiocyanate ligand\nscn_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)2].\n# The mole fraction (alpha_n) of a complex [ML_n] is given by:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + beta_1*[L]^1 + beta_2*[L]^2 + ... + beta_N*[L]^N)\n# Here, we want to find alpha_2.\n\n# Calculate each term in the denominator (the distribution function sum)\nterm0 = 1  # For the free Co(II) ion\nterm1 = beta1 * (scn_conc ** 1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2) # This is also the numerator\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc ** 3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc ** 4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing all cobalt species\ndenominator_sum = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nfraction_CoSCN2 = numerator / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_CoSCN2 = fraction_CoSCN2 * 100\n\n# Print the final result along with the choices\nprint(f\"The fraction of [Co(SCN)2] is: {fraction_CoSCN2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: {percentage_CoSCN2:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(f\"A) 25.6%\")\nprint(f\"B) 16.9%\")\nprint(f\"C) 38.1%\")\nprint(f\"D) 42.3%\")\n\n# Determine which choice is correct\nchoices = {'A': 25.6, 'B': 16.9, 'C': 38.1, 'D': 42.3}\nfor choice, value in choices.items():\n    if math.isclose(percentage_CoSCN2, value, rel_tol=1e-2):\n        correct_choice = choice\n        break\nelse:\n    correct_choice = \"None of the above\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated percentage ({percentage_CoSCN2:.1f}%) matches choice {correct_choice}.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
