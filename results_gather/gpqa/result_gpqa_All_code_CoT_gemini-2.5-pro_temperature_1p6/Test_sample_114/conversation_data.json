    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after. Before the collision, we have a relativistic electron and a relativistic positron. After the collision, we have two photons. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light. The energy of a photon is `E_ph`.\n    *   `E_initial = E_electron + E_positron = γ_e * m * c² + γ_p * m * c²`\n    *   `E_final = E_photon1 + E_photon2`\n    *   Since the photons have the same energy, `E_final = 2 * E_ph`.\n    *   Setting `E_initial = E_final`, we can solve for `E_ph`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum must also be conserved. We'll consider the momentum along the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) separately.\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is `p = γmv`, which can also be written as `p = sqrt(γ² - 1) * mc`.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_ph = E_ph / c`.\n    *   **Vertical (y) Momentum**: The initial vertical momentum is zero. For the final vertical momentum to be zero, the two photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle `θ`. One photon goes up at `+θ`, and the other goes down at `-θ`.\n    *   **Horizontal (x) Momentum**: The initial horizontal momentum is the sum of the electron's momentum (positive direction) and the positron's momentum (negative direction). This must equal the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta.\n    *   `p_x_initial = p_electron - p_positron = (sqrt(γ_e² - 1) - sqrt(γ_p² - 1)) * mc`\n    *   `p_x_final = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)`\n    *   Setting `p_x_initial = p_x_final` allows us to create an equation to solve for `cos(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Calculation**: We will substitute the expression for photon energy (`E_ph`) from the energy conservation step into the momentum conservation equation. This will allow us to solve for `cos(θ)`. The total angle between the photons is `2 * θ`. We will then calculate this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given Lorentz factors\ngamma_e = 4  # Lorentz factor of the electron\ngamma_p = 2  # Lorentz factor of the positron\n\n# The problem can be solved without needing the values of m and c, as they cancel out.\n# Let's derive the expression for cos(theta).\n# From energy conservation: (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m * c^2 = 2 * E_ph\n# From x-momentum conservation: (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m * c = 2 * p_ph * cos(theta)\n# Since p_ph = E_ph / c, we can write:\n# (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m * c = 2 * (E_ph / c) * cos(theta)\n# Substitute E_ph = (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m * c^2 / 2 into the momentum equation:\n# (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m * c = 2 * ((gamma_e + gamma_p) * m * c^2 / 2 / c) * cos(theta)\n# Simplify the equation by cancelling m*c on both sides:\n# sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1) = (gamma_e + gamma_p) * cos(theta)\n# So, cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) / (gamma_e + gamma_p)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate cos(theta)\nnumerator = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)\ndenominator = gamma_e + gamma_p\ncos_theta = numerator / denominator\n\n# Step 3: Calculate theta in degrees\n# theta is the angle one photon makes with the horizontal axis.\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# Step 4: The total angle between the two photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle_deg = 2 * theta_deg\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and determine the closest option\nprint(\"Options:\")\nprint(\"A) 172\")\nprint(\"B) 96\")\nprint(\"C) 138\")\nprint(\"D) 74\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"The angle of one photon relative to the horizontal axis is: {theta_deg:.2f} degrees\")\nprint(f\"The total angle between the two photons is: {total_angle_deg:.2f} degrees\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\noptions = {'A': 172, 'B': 96, 'C': 138, 'D': 74}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - total_angle_deg))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}: {options[closest_option]} degrees.\")\n\n# Final answer format\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(\"The calculated angle is approximately 137 degrees.\")\nprint(\"The closest option is C.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
