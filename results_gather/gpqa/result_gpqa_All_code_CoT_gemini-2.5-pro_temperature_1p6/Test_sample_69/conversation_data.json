    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the simplest reaction first (Reaction 4):**\n    *   `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   This is a classic inorganic reaction. A common example is the reaction of sulfur dioxide (`SO2`) with chlorine (`Cl2`) to form a liquid reagent.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis: `SO2 (gas) + Cl2 (gas) -> SOCl2 (thionyl chloride)`. This reaction works, often with a catalyst. `SOCl2` is a liquid used as a chlorinating agent and solvent. This seems very plausible.\n    *   So, let's tentatively identify: `D = SO2`, `B = Cl2`, and `H = SOCl2`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the hydrolysis reaction (Reaction 3):**\n    *   `C + H2O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`.\n    *   We identified `B` as `Cl2`. Therefore, `C` must be a chlorine-containing compound. The hydrolysis of a chlorine compound producing acids is very common.\n    *   The strong acid `F` must be hydrochloric acid, `HCl`.\n    *   The weak acid `G` must be a chlorine-containing weak acid. The most straightforward candidate is hypochlorous acid, `HClO`.\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction `Cl2 + H2O <=> HCl + HClO` perfectly produces our strong acid `F` and weak acid `G`.\n    *   The clue that `A` is reformed is crucial. This suggests that `C` is an adduct or complex where `A` is combined with the species that hydrolyzes. If the hydrolyzing species is `Cl2`, then `C` must be an adduct of `A` and `Cl2`, which can be written as `A·(Cl2)x`.\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction would then be: `A·(Cl2)x + xH2O -> A + xHCl + xHClO`. This fits all the clues for this step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the formation of C (Reaction 1):**\n    *   `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B -> bright red product C`.\n    *   We have identified `B` as `Cl2` and `C` as `A·(Cl2)x`.\n    *   The stoichiometry \"8 equivalents\" tells us the value of `x`. It means 1 mole of A reacts with 8 moles of `Cl2`. Therefore, `x=8`.\n    *   So, `C = A·(Cl2)8`. While the existence of such a stable compound might seem unusual, it logically follows from the clues. The \"bright red\" color is a property of this specific adduct `C`. The identity of `A` is not needed to proceed, only that it's a solid capable of forming this adduct.\n\n4.  **Analyze the formation of E (Reaction 2):**\n    *   `C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> extremely hazardous product E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified species: `A·(Cl2)8 + 2SO2 -> E`.\n    *   The `SO2` (a reducing agent) will react with the `Cl2` (an oxidizing agent) from the adduct. A well-known reaction is `SO2 + Cl2 -> SO2Cl2` (sulfuryl chloride).\n    *   The stoichiometry \"2 equivalents of gas D\" means 2 moles of `SO2` react. This implies that 2 of the 8 `Cl2` molecules in the adduct react.\n    *   `A·(Cl2)8 + 2SO2 -> A·(Cl2)6 + 2SO2Cl2`.\n    *   This identifies the \"extremely hazardous product\" `E` as **sulfuryl chloride, `SO2Cl2`**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The final step is to find the molecular symmetry group for `E = SO2Cl2`.\n    *   Sulfuryl chloride has a tetrahedral geometry around the central sulfur atom. Two positions are occupied by oxygen atoms (double-bonded), and two are occupied by chlorine atoms (single-bonded).\n    *   The molecule has a two-fold rotation axis (`C2`) that bisects both the O-S-O and Cl-S-Cl angles.\n    *   It also has two perpendicular mirror planes (`σv`). One plane contains the two chlorine atoms and the sulfur atom, and the other contains the two oxygen atoms and the sulfur atom.\n    *   A molecule with one `C2` axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing the axis belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\n6.  **Match with the choices:**\n    *   A) C2\n    *   B) D∞h\n    *   C) C2v\n    *   D) D4h\n    *   Our determined point group, `C2v`, matches option C.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Step 1: Lay out the puzzle components and deductions.\n# Reaction 4: D(gas) + B(gas) -> H(solvent) [1:1 ratio]\n# Deduction: This is likely SO2 + Cl2 -> SOCl2 (thionyl chloride).\n# So, D = SO2, B = Cl2, H = SOCl2.\n# Reaction 3: C + H2O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)\n# Deduction: Since B is Cl2, F is HCl (strong acid).\n# The reaction Cl2 + H2O -> HCl + HClO fits the products, making G = HClO (weak acid).\n# Since A is reformed, C must be an adduct: C = A·(Cl2)x.\n# Reaction 1: A(solid) + 8 B(gas) -> C(red)\n# Deduction: A + 8Cl2 -> A·(Cl2)x.
