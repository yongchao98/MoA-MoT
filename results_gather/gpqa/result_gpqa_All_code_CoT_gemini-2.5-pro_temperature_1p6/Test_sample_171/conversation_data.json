    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **State the Boltzmann Equation**: The problem assumes Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels. The equation is:\n    `N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `N_2 / N_1` is the ratio of populations in the excited state (2) versus the ground state (1), `g_2 / g_1` is the ratio of statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars**: We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star, using `T_1` for star_1 and `T_2` for star_2. Since we are considering the same energy levels in both stars, `ΔE` and `g_2 / g_1` are the same for both.\n    *   For star_1: `(N_2 / N_1)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2: `(N_2 / N_1)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    (Here, `C` represents the constant `g_2 / g_1`)\n\n3.  **Use the Information from the Problem**: The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means:\n    `(N_2 / N_1)_1 = 2 * (N_2 / N_1)_2`\n\n4.  **Combine and Simplify the Equations**: Substitute the expressions from step 2 into the relation from step 3:\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out. Now, take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`:\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\n    Factor out `ΔE / k` and combine the fractions:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n5.  **Use the Given Numerical Values**: The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`. This is a deliberate choice, meaning the factor `(ΔE / k)` is approximately 1.\n    `(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\n6.  **Final Equation**: Substituting this value into our derived equation, we get:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n    This matches option D.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the correct equation relating the temperatures of two stars, T_1 and T_2.\n# Based on the principles of the Boltzmann equation and the information provided:\n# 1. The ratio of populations of an excited state to a ground state is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n#    N_excited / N_ground = constant * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n# 2. For star 1 (temperature T_1): (Ratio)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n# 3. For star 2 (temperature T_2): (Ratio)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n# 4. The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2: (Ratio)_1 = 2 * (Ratio)_2\n# 5. Substituting the equations: C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n# 6. Simplifying and taking the natural log: -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n# 7. Rearranging for ln(2): ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n# 8. Factoring and combining fractions: ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n# 9. Using the given values, ΔE ≈ 1.38e-23 J and k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.\n#    This means the factor (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n# 10. The final equation is: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n# This corresponds to option D.\n\ncorrect_option = 'D'\nprint(f\"The correct equation is given in option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(\"A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\")\nprint(\"B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\")\nprint(\"C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\")\nprint(\"D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
