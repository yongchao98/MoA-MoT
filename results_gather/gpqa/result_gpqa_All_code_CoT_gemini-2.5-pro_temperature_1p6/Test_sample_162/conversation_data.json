    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Calculation for Acid Volume:**\n    *   First, we'll write down the neutralization reaction between iron(III) hydroxide (`Fe(OH)3`), a base, and a strong monobasic acid (`HA`). The reaction is:\n        `Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) -> Fe^3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)`\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of `Fe(OH)3` reacts with 3 moles of `H+` ions from the strong acid.\n    *   We calculate the molar mass of `Fe(OH)3`.\n    *   Using the given mass of `Fe(OH)3` (0.1 g), we find the number of moles of `Fe(OH)3`.\n    *   Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry, we calculate the moles of `H+` needed to react completely with the `Fe(OH)3`. This represents the minimum amount of acid required for the neutralization reaction.\n    *   Finally, using the molarity of the strong acid (0.1 M), we calculate the volume of the acid solution needed.\n\n2.  **pH Calculation of the Resulting Solution:**\n    *   After the neutralization, the `Fe(OH)3` has been converted into `Fe^3+` ions in the solution.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is given as 100 cm³ (0.1 L). We can calculate the concentration of `Fe^3+` ions.\n    *   The `Fe^3+` ion (more accurately `[Fe(H2O)6]^3+`) is a weak acid and hydrolyzes in water, producing `H+` ions and thus making the solution acidic. The reaction is:\n        `Fe^3+(aq) + H2O(l) <=> [Fe(OH)]^2+(aq) + H+(aq)`\n    *   We use the acid dissociation constant (`Ka`) for this hydrolysis to set up an equilibrium expression.\n    *   By solving the equilibrium expression (which will be a quadratic equation), we can find the equilibrium concentration of `H+` ions.\n    *   The pH of the final solution is then calculated as `-log10([H+])`.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   We will compare our calculated acid volume and pH with the given options to find the best match. Note that the options might be based on slightly different literature values for physical constants (`Ka` or `Ksp`), but the calculation method should lead to a value close to one of the choices.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\nV_total_L = 100 / 1000  # L (100 cm^3)\nM_acid = 0.1  # mol/L\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nMM_Fe = 55.845\nMM_O = 15.999\nMM_H = 1.008\n\n# Acid dissociation constant for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. A common textbook value is pKa = 2.2\n# Ka = 10^-2.2 which is approx 6.31e-3. We use this value for our calculation.\nKa_fe3 = 6.31e-3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3\nMM_feoh3 = MM_Fe + 3 * (MM_O + MM_H)\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / MM_feoh3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the minimum volume of acid based on stoichiometry\n# Reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe^3+ + 3H2O\n# Moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3\nmoles_h_needed = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n# Volume of acid (in L) = moles / molarity\nV_acid_L = moles_h_needed / M_acid\nV_acid_cm3 = V_acid_L * 1000\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n# When stoichiometric acid is added, the solution contains Fe^3+ ions\n# Concentration of Fe^3+\nC_fe3_initial = moles_feoh3 / V_total_L\n\n# The Fe^3+ hydrolyzes: Fe^3+ + H2O <=> [Fe(OH)]^2+ + H+\n# Ka = [H+]^2 / (C_fe3_initial - [H+])\n# [H+]^2 + Ka*[H+] - Ka*C_fe3_initial = 0\n# Solve the quadratic equation for [H+] = x\n# ax^2 + bx + c = 0\na = 1\nb = Ka_fe3\nc = -Ka_fe3 * C_fe3_initial\n\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\nH_plus_conc = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH = -math.log10(H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the results to compare with the options\nprint(f\"Calculated Results:\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3: {MM_feoh3:.2f} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3: {moles_feoh3:.4e} mol\")\nprint(f\"Required Volume of Acid: {V_acid_cm3:.2f} cm3\")\nprint(f\"Calculated pH of the final solution: {pH:.2f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Comparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3\")\nprint(\"B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3\")\nprint(\"C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3\")\nprint(\"D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Conclusion:\")\nprint(\"The calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm3) is an almost perfect match for option B (28.05 cm3).\")\nprint(\"The calculated pH (2.29) is reasonably close to the pH in option B (2.04).
