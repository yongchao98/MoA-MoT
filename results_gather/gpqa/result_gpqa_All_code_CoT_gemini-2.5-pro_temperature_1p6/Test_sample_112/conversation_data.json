    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Paired with the broad O-H stretch, this strongly indicates a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), i.e., an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for \"vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. The mass of the -COOH group is (12.01 for C) + (16.00 for O) + (16.00 for O) + (1.01 for H) ≈ 45.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   From all three techniques, we have overwhelming evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n    *   We also have strong evidence for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means the molecule must have a total DoU of 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **C) C6H12O2:** `DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1`. This only accounts for one double bond (e.g., the C=O), but not the C=C bond.\n        *   **D) C6H10O2:** `DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2`. This matches our required DoU of 2 (one for C=O, one for C=C).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The compound is a six-carbon carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene. The formula C6H10O2 is the only one that fits all the data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n    }\n    \n    # Step-by-step analysis based on the problem description\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"FTIR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Broad peak at 3000 cm-1 and strong peak at 1700 cm-1 indicate a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\")\n    print(\"- A peak at 1650 cm-1 indicates a C=C double bond (alkene).\")\n    print(\"- A carboxylic acid functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1H NMR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the C=C double bond.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nMass Spectrometry Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- A fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a -COOH fragment.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Synthesize the Findings\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The compound must contain a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\")\n    print(\"- This means the formula must have 2 oxygen atoms.\")\n    print(\"- This eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\")\n\n    # Filter options based on oxygen count\n    valid_options_oxygen = {key: val for key, val in options.items() if 'O2' in val}\n    print(f\"\\nRemaining options: {list(valid_options_oxygen.keys())}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\")\n    print(\"A C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\")\n    print(\"A C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\")\n    print(\"Required DoU = 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from C=C) = 2.\")\n    \n    # Define a function to calculate DoU\n    def calculate_dou(C, H):\n        return C + 1 - (H / 2)\n\n    # C6H12O2\n    dou_c = calculate_dou(6, 12)\n    print(f\"DoU for C6H12O2 (Option C) = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = {dou_c}.
