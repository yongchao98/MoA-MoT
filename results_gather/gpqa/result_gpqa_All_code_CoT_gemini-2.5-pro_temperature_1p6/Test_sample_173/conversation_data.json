    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Determine the Masses:** First, we'll calculate the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus (M) and the two fragments (m1 and m2) in units of GeV, based on the information provided.\n2.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies is converted into the total kinetic energy (T_total) of the fragments. This is due to the conservation of energy.\n3.  **Calculate T1 (Classical):** Using classical mechanics, we'll determine the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1). In a two-body decay from rest, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses (`T1/T2 = m2/m1`). We can use this ratio along with the total kinetic energy to find `T1_classical`.\n4.  **Calculate T1 (Relativistic):** Using the principles of special relativity, we will calculate the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1). This involves using the conservation of both energy and momentum in their relativistic forms. We'll solve for the total energy of the first fragment (E1) and then subtract its rest-mass energy to find its kinetic energy (`T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`).\n5.  **Find the Difference:** Finally, we'll calculate the difference between the relativistic `T1` and the classical `T1`, and convert the result from GeV to MeV to match the units in the options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Determine the Masses (in terms of energy, GeV)\n# M is the initial nucleus, m1 is the more massive fragment, m2 is the less massive fragment.\n# We use energy units (GeV) for mass, effectively setting c=1.\nM_energy = 300.0  # GeV\n\n# Sum of fragment rest-mass energies is 99% of M's rest-mass energy\nsum_m_energy = 0.99 * M_energy\n\n# We are given m1 = 2 * m2.
