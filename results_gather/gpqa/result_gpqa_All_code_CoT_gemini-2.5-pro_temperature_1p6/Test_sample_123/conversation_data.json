    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: The problem involves relativistic particles that decay. The key principle is **time dilation** from special relativity combined with the law of **radioactive decay**. The number of particles N that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ_lab), where N₀ is the initial number of particles and τ_lab is the mean lifetime in the lab's frame of reference.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The mean lifetime in the lab frame (τ_lab) is dilated compared to the particle's own proper lifetime (τ_proper) by the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula is: τ_lab = γ * τ_proper.\n\n3.  **Particle Survival Fraction**: The fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector wall is N/N₀. This is also called the survival probability. The time it takes to reach the wall in the lab frame is `t = R/v`, where R is the radius and v is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n    The survival fraction is therefore `f = exp(-(R/c) / τ_lab) = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`.\n\n4.  **Set up Equations for Both Scenarios**:\n    *   **Scenario 1**: Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, and the survival fraction f₁ = 1/3.\n        `1/3 = exp(-R / (c * 20 * τ_proper))`\n    *   **Scenario 2**: We need to find the new Lorentz factor γ₂ for a survival fraction f₂ = 2/3.\n        `2/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ_proper))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown (γ₂)**: We can solve this system of equations. The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is an unknown constant, but we can find its value from the first scenario.\n    *   From Scenario 1, take the natural log of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ_proper)`\n        `-ln(3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ_proper)`\n        `R / (c * τ_proper) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   Now substitute this constant into the equation for Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for γ₂:\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**: Use Python to compute the value of γ₂ and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem can be solved by setting up a ratio of the two scenarios.\n# Let f be the fraction of surviving particles, R be the detector radius,\n# c be the speed of light, gamma be the Lorentz factor, and tau be the proper lifetime.\n# The survival fraction is given by f = exp(-R / (c * gamma * tau)).\n\n# Scenario 1:\n# f1 = 1/3, gamma1 = 20\n# ln(f1) = -R / (c * gamma1 * tau)\n# ln(1/3) = -R / (c * 20 * tau)\n# -ln(3) = -R / (c * 20 * tau)\n# This gives us a value for the constant term: R/(c*tau) = 20 * ln(3)\n\n# Scenario 2:\n# f2 = 2/3, we need to find gamma2\n# ln(f2) = -R / (c * gamma2 * tau)\n\n# Now we substitute the constant term we found from Scenario 1:\n# ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / gamma2\n\n# Solve for gamma2:\n# gamma2 = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)\n# gamma2 = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))\n# gamma2 = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n# This is equivalent to gamma2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\ngamma1 = 20.0\n# Using the derived formula to calculate the new Lorentz factor (gamma2)\ngamma2 = (gamma1 * math.log(3)) / math.log(3/2)\n\nprint(f\"The initial Lorentz factor is {gamma1}.\")\nprint(\"When 1/3 of particles reach the detector.\")\nprint(\"\\nWe want to find the new Lorentz factor for which 2/3 of particles reach the detector.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated new Lorentz factor is: {gamma2:.2f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 54\")\nprint(\"B) 68\")\nprint(\"C) 28\")\nprint(\"D) 40\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19, which is closest to option A.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: A\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
