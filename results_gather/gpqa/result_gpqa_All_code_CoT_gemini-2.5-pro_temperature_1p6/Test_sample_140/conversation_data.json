    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of possible products, followed by the Python code to present the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Mechanism:** The reagents are 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide with a deuterium label) and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic setup for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Possible Benzyne Intermediates:** The first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom.\n    *   **Path A:** The base can remove the hydrogen (H) from carbon-6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. This creates a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6, while the deuterium (D) at C2 remains.\n    *   **Path B:** The base can also remove the deuterium (D) from carbon-2. This pathway is possible, though slower. This creates a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2, and the deuterium is eliminated from the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Products from Each Intermediate:** The second step is the addition of the nucleophile (NH2-) to the benzyne ring.\n    *   **Products from Path A (Deuterated Benzyne):** The NH2- can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 yields **aniline-2-d** (o-deuterioaniline).\n        *   Attack at C6 yields **aniline-3-d** (m-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Product from Path B (Non-Deuterated Benzyne):** The NH2- attacks the C1-C2 triple bond. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, attack at either C1 or C2 results in the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Count the Unique Products:** By combining the results from both pathways, we have three distinct organic products: aniline, aniline-2-d, and aniline-3-d.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_products():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of possible organic products from the reaction of\n    1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # This reaction proceeds via a benzyne intermediate through an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n    # Step 1: Formation of benzyne intermediates.\n    # The base NH2- can abstract a proton from either ortho position (C2 or C6).\n\n    # Path A: Abstraction of H from C6.
