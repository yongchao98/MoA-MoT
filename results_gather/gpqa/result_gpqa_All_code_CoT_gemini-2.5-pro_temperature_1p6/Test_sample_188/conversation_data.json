    "My plan is to solve this problem by examining the physical origin of each particle listed. The core concept is **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB)** and its direct consequence, **Goldstone's Theorem**. Goldstone's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a massless (or nearly massless) particle, called a Goldstone boson, must exist.\n\n1.  I will first define what a Goldstone boson is.\n2.  Then, for each option (Magnon, Pion, Phonon, Skyrmion), I will determine if it is a Goldstone boson resulting from a specific instance of SSB.\n    *   **Phonon:** Check if it's related to the breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\n    *   **Magnon:** Check if it's related to the breaking of rotational symmetry in a magnetic material.\n    *   **Pion:** Check if it's related to the breaking of chiral symmetry in particle physics.\n    *   **Skyrmion:** Check its nature. Is it a Goldstone boson, or is it a different type of object, such as a topological soliton?\n3.  Finally, I will identify the particle that is not a Goldstone boson and print the corresponding letter as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_particle_without_ssb_origin():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of particles to identify which is not a Goldstone boson,\n    the direct particle manifestation of a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Explanation of the physics concepts involved.\n    print(\"Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) occurs when the ground state of a system has less symmetry than the underlying physical laws.\")\n    print(\"Goldstone's Theorem states that for every spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, a massless particle, called a Goldstone boson, must appear.\")\n    print(\"We will now analyze each particle to see if it is a Goldstone boson.\\n\")\n\n    analysis = {\n        'A': {\n            'particle': 'Magnon',\n            'origin': 'In a ferromagnet, the atomic spins align in a specific direction, breaking the continuous rotational symmetry of the system.
