    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the structure of the unknown compound from the provided spectroscopic data and then calculate its chemical formula.\n\n**Here's the step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data to identify the substituents on the aromatic ring.**\n    *   The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means we start with a C6H4 core.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-).\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides key clues:\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The H on the carbon next to the ring would be a doublet, and the H on the carbon next to the methyl group would be a doublet of quartets.\n        *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other must be part of the ester group.\n        *   Combining the ester information with the second methyl signal suggests a methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** Our proposed structure with propenyl and methyl ester substituents contains no -CH2- groups, which is consistent with the data.\n\n2.  **Assemble the identified fragments.**\n    *   Aromatic ring core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (Propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (Methyl ester): The `-COOCH3` fragment consists of C, O, O, C, H, H, H. So, its formula is C2H3O2.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula.**\n    *   Sum the atoms from all fragments: (C6H4) + (C3H5) + (C2H3O2).\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Oxygens (O): 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n4.  **Match the final formula with the given options.**\n    *   The calculated molecular formula is C11H12O2. This corresponds to option B.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Deduces the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data\n    and matches it against given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the molecular fragments based on spectral data analysis.\n    # A di-substituted benzene ring implies a C6H4 core.\n    aromatic_core = {'C': 6, 'H': 4, 'O': 0}\n\n    # 1H NMR data (vinyl doublet and doublet of quartets) suggests a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    # This fragment has 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    substituent_1 = {'C': 3, 'H': 5, 'O': 0}\n\n    # FTIR (ester) and the second -CH3 signal in 1H NMR suggest a methyl ester group (-COOCH3).\n    # This fragment has 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n    substituent_2 = {'C': 2, 'H': 3, 'O': 2}\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the spectroscopic data to deduce structural fragments.\")\n    print(f\" - A di-substituted aromatic ring provides the core: C{aromatic_core['C']}H{aromatic_core['H']}\")\n    print(f\" - 1H NMR and FTIR data indicate two substituents:\")\n    print(f\"   - A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), with formula: C{substituent_1['C']}H{substituent_1['H']}\")\n    print(f\"   - A methyl ester group (-COOCH3), with formula: C{substituent_2['C']}H{substituent_2['H']}O{substituent_2['O']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total molecular formula by summing the atoms from all fragments.\n    total_C = aromatic_core['C'] + substituent_1['C'] + substituent_2['C']\n    total_H = aromatic_core['H'] + substituent_1['H'] + substituent_2['H']\n    total_O = aromatic_core['O'] + substituent_1['O'] + substituent_2['O']\n\n    calculated_formula = f\"C{total_C}H{total_H}O{total_O}\"\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculating the total molecular formula.\")\n    print(f\" - Total Carbons (C): {aromatic_core['C']} + {substituent_1['C']} + {substituent_2['C']} = {total_C}\")\n    print(f\" - Total Hydrogens (H): {aromatic_core['H']} + {substituent_1['H']} + {substituent_2['H']} = {total_H}\")\n    print(f\" - Total Oxygens (O): {aromatic_core['O']} + {substituent_1['O']} + {substituent_2['O']} = {total_O}\")\n    print(f\" - The calculated molecular formula is: {calculated_formula}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H14O2\"\n    }\n\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, formula in options.items():\n        if formula == calculated_formula:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Matching the calculated formula with the given options.\")\n    print(f\" - Options provided: A) {options['A']}, B) {options['B']}, C) {options['C']}, D) {options['D']}\")\n    print(f\" - The calculated formula {calculated_formula} matches option {correct_option}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The correct chemical formula is {calculated_formula}, which is option {correct_option}.\")\n    return correct_option\n\n# Execute the function and get the final answer in the required format\nfinal_choice = solve_spectroscopy_problem()\nprint(f\"<<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
