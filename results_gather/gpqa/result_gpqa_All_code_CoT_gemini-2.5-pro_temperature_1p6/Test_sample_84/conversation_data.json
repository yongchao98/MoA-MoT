    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** I'll begin with the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`). When calculating the ratio of temperatures for two planets around the same star (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`), and given they have the same albedo, most terms cancel out. The formula simplifies to `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`, where `a1` and `a2` are the orbital distances (semi-major axes) of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. The core of the problem is to find this distance ratio.\n2.  **Link Radial Velocity to Orbital Distance:** The problem provides Doppler shift (`Δλ`) data, which is a result of the radial velocity (RV) method. The star's maximum radial velocity swing (`K`) caused by a planet is related to the orbital distance (`a`) by the formula `K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))`. This assumes a circular orbit and an edge-on viewing angle (`sin(i) ≈ 1`), which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were also detected by the transit method.\n3.  **Determine the Orbital Distance Ratio:** By rearranging the formula from the previous step to solve for `a`, I get `a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (K^2 * M_star)`. I can then find the ratio `a2 / a1`. In this ratio, the gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out, leaving `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n4.  **Final Simplification:** I will substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio formula from step 1. This gives `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2 )`, which simplifies to the final, clean equation: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)`. The ratio of the radial velocities (`K1 / K2`) is identical to the ratio of the given Doppler shifts (`Δλ1 / Δλ2`).\n5.  **Code and Calculate:** Finally, I will write a Python script to implement this final formula. The script will use the given planet masses and Doppler shifts to compute the temperature ratio and identify the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for two exoplanets.\n\n# Given values from the problem statement:\n# Mass of Planet 1 in units of Earth mass.\nm_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in units of Earth mass.\nm_p2 = 5.0\n# Maximum Doppler shift in the spectral line caused by Planet 1, in Angstroms.\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Maximum Doppler shift in the spectral line caused by Planet 2, in Angstroms.\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# --- Derivation Logic ---\n# 1. The equilibrium temperature ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2) simplifies to sqrt(a2 / a1),\n#    where 'a' is the semi-major axis. This is because stellar properties and albedo cancel out.\n#\n# 2. The semi-major axis 'a' is related to the planet mass (m_p) and the induced\n#    stellar radial velocity amplitude (K) by a ∝ (m_p / K)^2.\n#\n# 3. Therefore, the ratio a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / K2)^2 / (m_p1 / K1)^2 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2.\n#\n# 4. Substituting this into the temperature ratio:\n#    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2)\n#    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m_p2 / m_p1) * (K1 / K2).\n#\n# 5. The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (K1 / K2) is equal to the ratio of\n#    their Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2).\n#\n# 6. Final formula: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m_p2 / m_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2).\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the planetary masses (m_p2 / m_p1).\nmass_ratio = m_p2 / m_p1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (which equals the ratio of radial velocity amplitudes, K1/K2).\ndoppler_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the final ratio of equilibrium temperatures.\nequilibrium_temp_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_ratio\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the planetary masses (M_p2 / M_p1) is: {mass_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The ratio of the Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2) is: {doppler_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The final calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {equilibrium_temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n\n# Comparing the result with the given choices:\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1.30,\n    \"B\": 0.53,\n    \"C\": 1.05,\n    \"D\": 0.98\n}\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparing with options ---\")\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    # Check if our calculated ratio is very close to the option's value\n    if math.isclose(equilibrium_temp_ratio, value, rel_tol=0.01):\n        print(f\"The result {equilibrium_temp_ratio:.2f} matches option {choice}) ~ {value}\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
