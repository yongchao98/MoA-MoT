    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Brightness Variation due to Spots**: First, I'll model the brightness variation of the star. The star's brightness is at its maximum when the clean, unspotted hemisphere is visible, and at its minimum when the hemisphere covered with dark spots is visible. The flux (brightness) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n2.  **Calculate the Relative Flux Drop**: I'll calculate the relative change in brightness (flux) between the maximum and minimum. This is the amplitude of the signal caused by the spots.\n    *   Maximum Flux (`F_max`) is proportional to `T_eff^4`.\n    *   Minimum Flux (`F_min`) is a mix: a fraction `(1-f)` of the area radiates at `T_eff^4` and a fraction `f` (the filling factor) radiates at `T_spot^4`. So, `F_min` is proportional to `(1-f)*T_eff^4 + f*T_spot^4`.\n    *   The relative drop is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`. This simplifies to `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`.\n3.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit**: The signal from a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is the fraction of the starlight it blocks. This is equal to the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area, which simplifies to `(R_pl / R_star)^2`.\n4.  **Equate and Solve**: I will set the signal from the spots equal to the signal from the hypothetical exoplanet and solve for the planet-to-star radius ratio, `R_pl / R_star`.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) )`\n5.  **Compute the Final Value**: I'll plug in the given numbers (`T_eff = 6000 K`, `T_spot = 5000 K`, `f = 0.20`) into the final equation and calculate the result. The code will then print this value, allowing us to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_planet_radius_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equivalent exoplanet-to-star radius ratio that would produce\n    the same photometric signal as the given spotted star.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the star's properties\n    T_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\n    spot_temp_difference = 1000  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\n    spot_filling_factor = 0.20  # 20% filling factor\n\n    # Calculate the temperature of the spots\n    T_spot = T_eff - spot_temp_difference\n\n    # The relative flux drop due to rotational modulation of the spotted hemisphere\n    # is given by the formula: Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4),\n    # where f is the filling factor.\n    flux_drop_from_spots = spot_filling_factor * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n    # The flux drop from a transiting exoplanet (transit depth) is given by\n    # the ratio of the areas: (R_planet / R_star)^2.\n    # We set the two effects to be equal.\n    # (R_pl / R_star)^2 = flux_drop_from_spots\n\n    # To find the radius ratio, we take the square root.\n    planet_star_radius_ratio = math.sqrt(flux_drop_from_spots)\n\n    # The given options for R_pl/R_star are:\n    options = {\n        'A': 0.32,\n        'B': 0.39,\n        'C': 0.07,\n        'D': 0.11\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Star's effective temperature (Teff): {T_eff} K\")\n    print(f\"Spot temperature (Tspot): {T_spot} K\")\n    print(f\"Spot filling factor (f): {spot_filling_factor}\")\n    print(f\"Relative flux drop from spots: {flux_drop_from_spots:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"This is equivalent to the transit depth (R_pl/R_star)^2.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Required planet-to-star radius ratio (R_pl/R_star): {planet_star_radius_ratio:.4f}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Multiple Choice Options ---\")\n    print(f\"A) ~{options['A']}\")\n    print(f\"B) ~{options['B']}\")\n    print(f\"C) ~{options['C']}\")\n    print(f\"D) ~{options['D']}\")\n    print(\"\\nOur calculated value most closely matches option A.\")\n\n\ncalculate_planet_radius_ratio()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
