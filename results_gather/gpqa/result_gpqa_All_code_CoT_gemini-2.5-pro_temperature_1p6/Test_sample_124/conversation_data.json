    "This is a classic quantum mechanics problem concerning the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state.\n\n**1. Energy Eigenvalues:**\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, and $n_x, n_y, n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ are the quantum numbers for the three Cartesian dimensions. The principal quantum number $N$ also starts from 0.\n\n*   The ground state corresponds to $N=0$.\n*   The first excited state corresponds to $N=1$.\n*   The second excited state corresponds to $N=2$.\n*   The **third excited state** corresponds to $N=3$.\n\nSubstituting $N=3$ into the energy formula gives:\n$E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**2. Degeneracy:**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of distinct sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum up to $N$. This is a problem in combinatorics, and the formula for the degeneracy $g_N$ is:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($N=3$), the degeneracy is:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions (states) with this energy. This matches option B. The expressions in options A and C are for a particle in a spherical box, not a harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe following Python code will calculate these values for you.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n# The energy levels are given by E_N = (N + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n# The degeneracy of a level N is given by g_N = (N+1)(N+2)/2.\n\n# The ground state is N=0.\n# The first excited state is N=1.\n# The second excited state is N=2.\n# The third excited state is N=3.\nN = 3\n\n# Calculate the energy factor\n# E = (N + 3/2) * hbar * omega = ((2*N + 3)/2) * hbar * omega\nenergy_numerator = 2 * N + 3\nenergy_denominator = 2\n\n# Calculate the degeneracy\n# g = (N+1)(N+2)/2\ndegeneracy = int(((N + 1) * (N + 2)) / 2)\n\n# Print the results to identify the correct option\nprint(f\"For the third excited state (N={N}):\")\nprint(f\"The energy is ({energy_numerator}/{energy_denominator}) * hbar * omega.\")\nprint(f\"The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is {degeneracy}.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n# The final answer choice\nfinal_choice = \"B\"\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The correct option is {final_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
