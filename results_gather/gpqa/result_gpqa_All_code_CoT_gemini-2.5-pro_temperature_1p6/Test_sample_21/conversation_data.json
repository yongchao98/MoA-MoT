    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first part of the statement:** \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n    *   The strength of an oxidant is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   We need to compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   In acidic solution: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l), with E° = +1.23 V.\n    *   In basic solution: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq), with E° = +0.40 V.\n    *   Since +0.40 V (basic) is less than +1.23 V (acidic), oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This narrows down the options to A and C.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the statement:** \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n    *   This part refers to the speed of the reaction (kinetics).\n    *   The reduction of O₂ to H₂O is a complex reaction that involves the transfer of four electrons and the breaking of a very strong O=O double bond.\n    *   This process has a high activation energy, which means the reaction rate is intrinsically slow. This phenomenon is known as a high overpotential for oxygen reduction.\n    *   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower**, even though it is a thermodynamically stronger oxidant in acidic solution.\n\n3.  **Combine the results:**\n    *   The first blank is \"weaker\".\n    *   The second blank is \"slower\".\n    *   The correct combination is \"weaker - slower\", which corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_electrochemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the electrochemistry problem by analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of oxygen.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the thermodynamic aspect ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the thermodynamic strength of oxygen as an oxidant.\")\n    print(\"The strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°).
