    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The Doppler shift equation tells us that the observed shift in a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K. Therefore, the ratio of the K values for the two stars is the same as the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts.\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a star with a single planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (P), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the planet's mass ($m_p$). The simplified relationship, assuming other factors are constant, is:\n    *   $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n3.  **Derive the Period Ratio:** From the relationship above, we can express the period P in terms of K:\n    *   $P \\propto \\frac{1}{K^3}$ or $P \\propto K^{-3}$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the two planets' orbital periods is: $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** We can now substitute the ratio of the wavelength shifts into the equation for the period ratio and calculate the numerical result. This will allow us to select the correct answer from the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given wavelength shifts.\n# delta_lambda_1 is the shift for the star with planet #1 (in miliangstrom).\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5\n# delta_lambda_2 is the shift for the star with planet #2 (in miliangstrom).\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7\n\n# Step 2: The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift.\n# So, the ratio K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of the shifts.\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Step 3: The orbital period (P) is proportional to K^(-3).\n# Therefore, the ratio of the periods P2/P1 is equal to (K1/K2)^3.\nP_ratio_2_over_1 = K_ratio_1_over_2 ** 3\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final numerical answer and print it.\n# The question asks how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1.\nprint(f\"The ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 is: {P_ratio_2_over_1:.2f}\")\n\n# Compare the result with the given options:\n# A) ~ 1.96\n# B) ~ 0.85\n# C) ~ 1.40\n# D) ~ 0.36\n# Our calculated value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\nprint(\"The correct option is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
