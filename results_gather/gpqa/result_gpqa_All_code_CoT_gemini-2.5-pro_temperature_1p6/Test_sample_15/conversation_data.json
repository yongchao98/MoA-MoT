    "To determine how many of the given compounds are optically active, we need to analyze each molecule for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains one or more stereocenters and lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp2-hybridized and cannot be stereocenters. There are no other carbons with four different substituents in the molecule. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name explicitly specifies the stereochemistry at multiple stereocenters (`3aR, 7aS`). This indicates that a single, specific stereoisomer is being described. Unless this specific combination of stereocenters results in a meso compound (which is highly unlikely given the complex and asymmetric structure), the molecule is chiral. Being a pure enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, with a `COOH` group at each end and a `CH3` group on each stereocenter. The `(2R, 3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. In the `(2R, 3R)` configuration (where both methyl groups are on the \"same side\" in a Fischer projection), there is no internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and non-superimposable on its mirror image (the (2S, 3S) isomer). Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. Carbon-1 is bonded to four different groups: an -OH group, an -H atom, and two different carbon pathways around the ring (`-CH2-CH=` and `-CH2-CH2-`). This makes C1 a stereocenter. Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This molecule has three -OH groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation indicates they are all on the same side of the ring (e.g., all pointing 'up'). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** Let's examine the structure: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it does not have four different substituents, it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the molecule is a stereocenter. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically Active: 3 compounds (2, 4, 5)\n*   Optically Inactive: 4 compounds (1, 3, 6, 7)\n\nThe number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know how many of the listed compounds are optically active.\n# I will analyze each compound for chirality.\n# A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture.\n# Generally, a molecule with an R/S designation is a single enantiomer and is active,\n# unless it's a meso compound.\n\n# List of compounds\ncompounds = [\n    \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\",\n    \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\",\n    \"(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\",\n    \"(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\",\n    \"(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\",\n    \"(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\",\n    \"1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\"\n]\n\n# Analysis of each compound:\n# 1.
