    "The problem asks for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the derivation and identify the correct option.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field observed at a point `r` at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, `tr`, called the retarded time. The signal travels at the speed of light `c`. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr`, denoted `s(tr)`, to the observation point `r`. This relationship is given by:\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n    The vector `d` is defined as `d = r - s(tr)`, so its magnitude is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`. The condition becomes `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n2.  **General Retarded Potentials:** For a continuous charge distribution `ρ` and current density `J`, the potentials are given by:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\n3.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities are:\n    `ρ(r', t) = q * δ³(r' - s(t))`\n    `J(r', t) = q * v(t) * δ³(r' - s(t))`\n    where `δ³` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Integrals:** Substituting these into the potential formulas and evaluating the integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration (which accounts for the \"compression\" of the charge's effective volume due to its motion relative to the observer) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The denominator `|r - r'|` gets replaced by a more complex term `S = d - (d ⋅ v) / c`, where `d`, `d`, and `v` are all evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n5.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The resulting potentials are:\n    Scalar Potential (V): `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    Vector Potential (A): `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n\n6.  **Comparison with Options:** Let's manipulate these standard forms to match the given choices. The denominator can be rewritten as:\n    `d - (d ⋅ v) / c = (1/c) * (d*c - d ⋅ v)`\n\n    Substituting this into the expression for `V`:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((1/c)(dc - d ⋅ v))] = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n    Now let's find `A` in terms of `V`. Notice that `A` is very similar to `V`:\n    `A(r, t) = μ₀ε₀ * v * V(r, t)`\n    Using the relation `c² = 1 / (μ₀ε₀)`, this becomes:\n    `A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`\n    Substituting the expression for `V` we just found:\n    `A(r, t) = (v / c²) * [qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n    `A(r, t) = qcv / (4πε₀c² * (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    Using `ε₀c² = 1/μ₀`:\n    `A(r, t) = qcv / (4π(1/μ₀)(dc - d ⋅ v)) = (μ₀qcv) / (4π(dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n7.  **Final Check:**\n    - The derived expression for `V` is `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d ⋅ v))`.\n    - The derived expression for `A` is `A(r, t) = (μ₀qcv) / (4π(dc - d ⋅ v))`.\n\n    These expressions perfectly match **Option B**.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n# Based on the principles of classical electrodynamics, the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) are derived from the retarded-time integrals.\n\n# The standard formulas are:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / (4*pi*epsilon_0)) * [q / (d - (d . v) / c)]\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 / (4*pi)) * [q*v / (d - (d . v) / c)]\n\n# Here:\n# q = charge\n# r = observation point vector\n# s(t_r) = position of the charge at the retarded time t_r\n# d = r - s(t_r) is the vector from the retarded position to the observer\n# d = |d| is its magnitude\n# v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time\n# c is the speed of light\n# The dot in (d . v) represents the dot product.\n\n# We can rewrite the denominator of these expressions:\n# d - (d . v) / c = (d*c - d . v) / c\n\n# Substituting this back into the formula for V:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / (4*pi*epsilon_0)) * [q / ((d*c - d . v) / c)]\n# V(r, t) = (q*c) / (4*pi*epsilon_0 * (d*c - d . v))\n\n# Similarly for A:\n# We know that A = (v / c^2) * V\n# A(r,t) = (v / c^2) * [(q*c) / (4*pi*epsilon_0 * (d*c - d . v))]\n# A(r,t) = (q*c*v) / (4*pi*epsilon_0*c^2 * (d*c - d . v))\n# Using the identity c^2 = 1 / (mu_0 * epsilon_0), which means epsilon_0*c^2 = 1/mu_0\n# A(r,t) = (q*c*v) / (4*pi*(1/mu_0) * (d*c - d . v))\n# A(r,t) = (mu_0*q*c*v) / (4*pi * (d*c - d . v))\n\n# Comparing these results with the given options:\n# A) V is for a static charge. Incorrect.\n# B) V(r,t) = qc / (4*pi*epsilon_0*(d*c - d.v)), A(r,t) = (mu_0*q*c*v) / (4*pi*(d*c - d.v)). This matches our derivation perfectly.\n# C) The sign in the denominator is '+'.
