    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Principle:** The key factor for options c and d is the effect of gravity on a planet's density. For planets made of the same materials (i.e., \"same composition\"), a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly, resulting in a higher overall density. Conversely, a less massive planet has weaker gravity and will be less compressed, resulting in a lower density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, essentially Earth itself. Earth's average density is about 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is almost identical to Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Based on our principle, since this planet is much more massive than Earth, it will experience significantly more gravitational compression. Therefore, its density will be considerably higher than Earth's density.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is less massive than Earth. It will experience less gravitational compression, so its density will be lower than Earth's.\n\n3.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to compression)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less compression)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth (c) will be the densest due to gravitational compression. The code below will calculate and confirm this.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Analysis of Exoplanet Densities ---\n# We will use Earth's density as a baseline and model how density changes\n# with mass for planets of the same composition.\n\n# Baseline density of Earth (in g/cm^3)\ndensity_earth = 5.51\n\n# a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\n# This is our reference, so its density is Earth's density.\ndensity_a = density_earth\n\n# b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\n# The density is given in the problem statement.\ndensity_b = 5.5\n\n# c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive.\n# For rocky planets, density increases with mass due to gravitational compression.\n# A common model is Density ∝ Mass^p, where p is a small positive exponent.\n# For example, using the relation Radius ∝ Mass^0.27, we get Density ∝ Mass^0.19.\n# The exact exponent isn't crucial; the key is that density *increases* with mass.\nmass_ratio_c = 5.0\n# The density will be higher than Earth's.\ndensity_c = density_earth * (mass_ratio_c ** 0.19)\n\n# d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\n# Less mass means less compression, so density will be lower than Earth's.\nmass_ratio_d = 0.5\ndensity_d = density_earth * (mass_ratio_d ** 0.19)\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(\"Calculating the density for each option:\")\nprint(f\"a) An Earth-like planet has a density of {density_a:.2f} g/cm^3.\")\nprint(f\"b) The second planet's density is given as {density_b:.2f} g/cm^3.\")\nprint(f\"c) The 5-Earth-mass planet has a calculated density of {density_c:.2f} g/cm^3.\")\nprint(f\"d) The 0.5-Earth-mass planet has a calculated density of {density_d:.2f} g/cm^3.\")\n\n# --- Determine the highest density ---\ndensities = {\n    \"a\": density_a,\n    \"b\": density_b,\n    \"c\": density_c,\n    \"d\": density_d\n}\n\n# Find the option with the maximum density value\nhighest_density_option = max(densities, key=densities.get)\n\nprint(f\"\\nConclusion: Planet 'c' has the highest density ({densities[highest_density_option]:.2f} g/cm^3).\")\n\n# The final choices are A) c, B) a, C) b, D) d.\n# Since 'c' is the correct exoplanet, the correct choice is 'A'.\nprint(\"\\nThe corresponding answer choice is 'A'.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
