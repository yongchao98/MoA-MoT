    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the outcome of the HPLC experiments.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Each Reaction**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water. This two-step process results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (trans-alkene)**\n    *   The rule for the stereochemical outcome of an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene is the formation of a *meso* compound.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes *anti*-dihydroxylation to produce a single product: the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral and has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis-alkene)**\n    *   The rule for the stereochemical outcome of an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is the formation of a *racemic mixture* (an equal mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoes *anti*-dihydroxylation to produce two products in equal amounts: the enantiomers (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct chemical species (stereoisomers):\n1.  (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are enantiomers of each other.\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a diastereomer of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n**3. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the mixture will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\n        *   Peak 2: The unresolved racemic mixture of enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   The mixture will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\n        *   Peak 2: The (4R,5R)-enantiomer.\n        *   Peak 3: The (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe experiment will result in 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This matches option C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two chemical reactions and predicts the HPLC results.\n\n    Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+ -> Produces one meso compound.\n    Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+ -> Produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers).\n    \n    Mixture contains: 1 meso compound + 2 enantiomers = 3 stereoisomers.\n    \n    Standard HPLC: Separates diastereomers, but not enantiomers.\n    - Peak 1: Meso compound.\n    - Peak 2: Racemic mixture (enantiomers co-elute).\n    Total = 2 peaks.\n    \n    Chiral HPLC: Separates both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n    - Peak 1: Meso compound.\n    - Peak 2: Enantiomer R,R.\n    - Peak 3: Enantiomer S,S.\n    Total = 3 peaks.\n    \n    Therefore, the correct choice is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The options are:\n    # A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n    # B) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n    # C) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\n    # D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n    \n    final_answer = \"C\"\n    \n    print(\"The analysis leads to the following conclusion:\")\n    print(\"Number of peaks in standard (achiral) HPLC: 2\")\n    print(\"Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: 3\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```"
