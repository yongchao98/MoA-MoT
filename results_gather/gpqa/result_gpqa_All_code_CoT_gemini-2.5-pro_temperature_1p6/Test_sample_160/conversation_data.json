    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Define λ1 and λ2:** First, we must clearly understand what each variable represents.\n    *   `λ1` is the mean free path (MFP) of the remaining **gas molecules colliding with each other**.\n    *   `λ2` is the mean free path (MFP) of the **electrons from the beam scattering off the gas molecules**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mean Free Path Formula:** The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), which represents the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for a collision. The general relationship is `λ ∝ 1/σ`.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Types and Cross-Sections:**\n    *   **For λ1 (Gas-Gas):** The collision is between two neutral gas molecules. This interaction is governed by very short-range intermolecular forces (like Van der Waals forces). The collision cross-section, `σ_gas-gas`, is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   **For λ2 (Electron-Gas):** The \"collision\" is an electron scattering off a neutral gas molecule. An electron is a fundamental charged particle. It interacts with the gas molecule's components (the positive nucleus and the negative electron cloud) via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force. An electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\") even if it passes relatively far from the molecule's center.\n\n4.  **Draw a Conclusion:** Because the electrostatic force has a much longer range than the forces governing molecule-molecule collisions, the effective target area that a gas molecule presents to an incoming electron (`σ_e-gas`) is significantly larger than the target area it presents to another gas molecule (`σ_gas-gas`).\n    *   Therefore, `σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas`.\n\n5.  **Relate to Mean Free Path:** Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (`λ ∝ 1/σ`), the particle type with the larger cross-section will have the shorter mean free path.\n    *   Given that `σ_e-gas` is larger, the corresponding mean free path `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n    *   Conclusion: `λ2 < λ1`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to understand the relationship between two mean free paths, λ1 and λ2,\n# in a transmission electron microscope.\n\n# λ1: Mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n# λ2: Mean free path of electrons scattering off those same gas molecules.\n\n# The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions.\n# It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the\n# collision cross-section (σ).\n# λ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\n# In this scenario, the number density (n) of gas molecules is the same for both cases.\n# The key difference is the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n# For λ1, the interaction is between two neutral gas molecules.
