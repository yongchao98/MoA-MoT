    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1**\n    *   This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to place a bromine atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   Product 1 is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heat) → Product 2**\n    *   This is a reaction of an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base. While an E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is possible, the subsequent reaction step gives a clue. Step 3 uses thionyl chloride (SOCl2), a reagent that famously converts carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides. This strongly suggests that a **Favorskii rearrangement** has occurred.\n    *   In the Favorskii rearrangement, the alpha-halo ketone rearranges to form a carboxylic acid with one fewer carbon in the ring. Cyclohexanone becomes a cyclopentane derivative.\n    *   Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂/Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   As predicted, this step converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into an acyl chloride group (-COCl).\n    *   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃) is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to a primary alcohol.\n    *   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n5.  **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n    *   Now we must analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde and count the number of unique hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in a proton NMR spectrum.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n    *   Let's count the sets of equivalent protons:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-CO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two attached hydrogens are diastereotopic (they are not equivalent because one is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group and the other is \"trans\"). Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2/C5 constitute two separate types. (2 types)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two hydrogens on each are also diastereotopic. This gives us another two types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n    *   **Total Count:** Summing them up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# This code formalizes the counting of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms\n# in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n# The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n# We count the number of unique proton environments based on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n# 1. The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO).\nnum_aldehyde_protons = 1\n\n# 2. The single proton on the carbon of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1).\nnum_C1_protons = 1\n\n# 3. The protons on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5).\n# C2 and C5 are equivalent, but the two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic\n# (not equivalent), creating two distinct sets of protons.\nnum_C2_C5_proton_types = 2\n\n# 4. The protons on the carbons furthest from the aldehyde group (C3 and C4).\n# C3 and C4 are equivalent, but like C2/C5, the two protons on each\n# carbon are diastereotopic, creating another two distinct sets.\nnum_C3_C4_proton_types = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\ntotal_distinct_hydrogens = (num_aldehyde_protons +\n                             num_C1_protons +\n                             num_C2_C5_proton_types +\n                             num_C3_C4_proton_types)\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(\"The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\")\nprint(f\"Number of chemically distinct aldehyde protons: {num_aldehyde_protons}\")\nprint(f\"Number of distinct proton types on C1: {num_C1_protons}\")\nprint(f\"Number of distinct proton types on C2/C5: {num_C2_C5_proton_types}\")\nprint(f\"Number of distinct proton types on C3/C4: {num_C3_C4_proton_types}\")\nprint(\"---\")\nprint(f\"Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is: {total_distinct_hydrogens}\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
