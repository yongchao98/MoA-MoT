    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This tells us the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the total magnetic quantum number (the z-component) is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement State:** We are measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of getting eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m_z\\hbar$. Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the first electron in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and the second electron in the state with $m_2 = -1$. This corresponds to the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Rule:** A fundamental rule in the coupling of angular momentum is that the total magnetic quantum number is the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers. That is, $m = m_1 + m_2$. The coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for which this condition holds. If $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the uncoupled state is orthogonal to the coupled state, and the probability of transitioning to it upon measurement is zero.\n\n4.  **Check the Condition:**\n    *   For our initial state, $m = -1$.\n    *   For our measurement outcome state, $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the two, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because the z-component of the total angular momentum is not conserved between the initial state and the desired measurement outcome, the states are orthogonal. The probability of measuring this outcome is therefore zero.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this check.\n\n```python\n# Define the quantum numbers for the initial coupled state\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Define the quantum numbers for the measured uncoupled state\n# Eigenvalue of L_1z = -hbar means m1 = -1\n# Eigenvalue of L_2z = -hbar means m2 = -1\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# According to the rules of angular momentum coupling, the total magnetic quantum\n# number 'm' must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers (m1 + m2).\n# The probability of measuring the system in a state |m1, m2> is zero unless m = m1 + m2.\n\n# Check if the condition m = m1 + m2 is satisfied.\nsum_of_m = m1 + m2\n\nif m == sum_of_m:\n    # This block would be executed if the measurement was possible.\n    # We would need Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to find the exact probability.\n    probability = \"Non-zero, requires Clebsch-Gordan coefficient\"\nelse:\n    # Since m is not equal to m1 + m2, the states are orthogonal.\n    # The probability of this measurement is exactly 0.\n    probability = 0\n\nprint(f\"Initial state has total magnetic quantum number m = {m}\")\nprint(f\"Measured state has m1 = {m1} and m2 = {m2}, so their sum is {sum_of_m}\")\nprint(f\"Is m == (m1 + m2)? {m == sum_of_m}\")\nprint(\"Since the condition is not met, the probability of this measurement is 0.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) 2/3\")\nprint(\"B) 0\")\nprint(\"C) 1\")\nprint(\"D) 1/2\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated joint probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
