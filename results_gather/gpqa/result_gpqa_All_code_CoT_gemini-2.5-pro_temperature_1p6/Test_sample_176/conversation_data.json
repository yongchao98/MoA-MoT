    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing laws:** The problem involves the luminosity, radius, and temperature of stars radiating as black bodies. The key physical principles are the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Wien's Displacement Law.\n2.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n3.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body to its temperature (T). The formula is `λ_max = b / T`, where b is Wien's constant.\n4.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   Radius relationship: `R1 = 1.5 * R2`.\n    *   Wavelength relationship: The problem states the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning `λ_max1 = λ_max2`.\n    *   Extraneous information: The mass and radial velocity information is not required to solve for the luminosity ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and is included as a distraction.\n5.  **Determine the temperature ratio:** According to Wien's Law, if `λ_max1 = λ_max2`, then it must be true that `T1 = T2`. The two stars have the same surface temperature.\n6.  **Calculate the luminosity ratio (L1 / L2):**\n    *   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we can write the ratio as: `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)`.\n    *   The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the equation to: `L1 / L2 = (R1² * T1⁴) / (R2² * T2⁴)`.\n7.  **Substitute the known relationships:**\n    *   Substitute `R1 = 1.5 * R2` and `T1 = T2` into the simplified ratio equation.\n    *   `L1 / L2 = ((1.5 * R2)² * T2⁴) / (R2² * T2⁴)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `L1 / L2 = 1.5²`.\n8.  **Compute the final value:** Calculate the square of 1.5 to find the factor. This will be done in the Python code.\n\n```python\n# The luminosity (L) of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴.\n# We are given that the peak emission wavelengths are the same for both stars.\n# According to Wien's Displacement Law (λ_max = b / T), if the wavelengths (λ_max) are the same,\n# the surface temperatures (T) must also be the same. So, T1 = T2.\n\n# We are given the relationship between the radii: R1 = 1.5 * R2.\n# Let's define the ratio of the radii.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# We need to find the ratio of the luminosities, L1 / L2.\n# L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)\n# Since T1 = T2, the temperature terms cancel out. The constants also cancel.\n# The equation simplifies to L1 / L2 = R1² / R2² = (R1 / R2)².\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio.\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio ** 2\n\n# Print the result and compare it to the options.\nprint(f\"The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of: {luminosity_ratio}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\nprint(\"A) ~2.23\")\nprint(\"B) ~2.32\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.25\")\nprint(\"D) ~2.35\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
