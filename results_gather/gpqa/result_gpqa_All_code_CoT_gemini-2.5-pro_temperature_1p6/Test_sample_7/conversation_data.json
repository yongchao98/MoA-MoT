  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the phenotypes of single mutants.**\nFirst, we look at the effect of knocking out each gene individually compared to the wild-type (control) resistance of 100%.\n-   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** Loss of G1 function causes a 25% drop in resistance. So, G1 contributes to resistance.\n-   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** Loss of G2 function causes a complete loss of resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for the resistance phenotype.\n-   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** Loss of G3 function causes a 50% drop in resistance. So, G3 also contributes significantly to resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the phenotypes of double mutants to determine epistasis.**\nEpistasis is a genetic interaction where the effect of one gene is masked by the effect of another. By comparing the phenotype of a double mutant to its corresponding single mutants, we can deduce the gene order in a pathway. The gene whose phenotype is visible in the double mutant is said to be \"epistatic\" to the other gene.\n\n-   **Interaction between G1 and G2:**\n    -   g1 resistance = 75%\n    -   g2 resistance = 0%\n    -   g1g2 double mutant resistance = 0%\n    -   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**. In a linear pathway, this implies that G2 acts downstream of G1 (e.g., G1 -> G2 -> Resistance).\n\n-   **Interaction between G2 and G3:**\n    -   g2 resistance = 0%\n    -   g3 resistance = 50%\n    -   g2g3 double mutant resistance = 0%\n    -   The phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This implies that G2 acts downstream of G3 (e.g., G3 -> G2 -> Resistance).\n\n-   **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    -   g1 resistance = 75%\n    -   g3 resistance = 50%\n    -   g1g3 double mutant resistance = 10%\n    -   The phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant (10%) is not the same as either single mutant. In fact, it's more severe than both. This indicates a synergistic interaction, often seen when two genes function in parallel, partially redundant pathways. There is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize a pathway model and evaluate the options.**\nBased on the analysis, G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3, which likely act in parallel. The fact that the `g1g3` mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant suggests they contribute to the pathway in a way that is partially redundant (i.e., they perform similar or related upstream functions).\nThe initial prompt states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. A transcription factor regulates the expression of a downstream gene. The model `G1 -> G2` and `G3 -> G2` is consistent with G1 and/or G3 being transcription factors that regulate the expression of gene G2.\n\nNow, let's check the given choices against our findings:\n-   **A)** Claims \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". This is false based on our analysis of the `g1g3` mutant.\n-   **B)** Claims \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\". This is true based on our analysis of the `g1g2` mutant. The claim \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is a plausible explanation for the upstream role of G1 relative to G2. Pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be confirmed or denied from this data, but the option does not contain any false statements.\n-   **C)** Claims \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". This is false.\n-   **D)** Claims \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". This is false.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option B is the only one that contains a statement (\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\") that is verifiably true from the provided data. The other options contain statements about epistasis between G1 and G3 which are demonstrably false.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\ndef analyze_genetic_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided genetic data and prints the logical steps to reach the conclusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the experiment\n    resistance = {\n        'WT': 100,\n        'g1': 75,\n        'g2': 0,\n        'g3': 50,\n        'g1g2': 0,\n        'g2g3': 0,\n        'g1g3': 10\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze Single Mutant Phenotypes\")\n    print(f\"- Wild-Type (Control) has 100% resistance.\")\n    print(f\"- g1 mutant has {resistance['g1']}% resistance.
