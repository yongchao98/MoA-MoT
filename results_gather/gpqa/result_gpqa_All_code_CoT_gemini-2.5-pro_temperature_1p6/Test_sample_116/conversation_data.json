    "My plan is to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate):** I will check for axial chirality (atropisomerism), which occurs in substituted biphenyls where rotation around the central single bond is restricted by bulky groups.\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):** I will look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n3.  **Analyze Compound 3 (benzophenone):** I will check for any chiral centers and look for elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry) that would make it achiral.\n4.  **Analyze Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):** I will examine its structure for chirality, noting that it is a *trans*-alkene and likely possesses elements of symmetry.\n5.  **Synthesize Results:** I will collect the list of optically active compounds.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will create a Python script that programmatically represents this analysis, determines the optically active compounds, and selects the correct answer from the given multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds to determine which exhibit optical isomerism and selects the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image).\n    # Common causes of chirality are chiral centers or axial/planar chirality.\n    # Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral.\n\n    compounds_analysis = {\n        1: {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"is_chiral\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"This is a substituted biphenyl.
