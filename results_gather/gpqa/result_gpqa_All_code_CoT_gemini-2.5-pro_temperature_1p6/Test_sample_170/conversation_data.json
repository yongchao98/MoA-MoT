    "An electrophilic substitution reaction's outcome, specifically the ratio of ortho, meta, and para isomers, is determined by the nature of the substituent already on the benzene ring. We can solve this problem by analyzing the directing effects of each substituent.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Categorize Substituents:** First, I'll classify the substituents on each of the six benzene derivatives into two groups:\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. They result in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n\n2.  **Rank Within Categories:**\n    *   **Meta-Directors:** For substances with meta-directing groups (-NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5), the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of this para-isomer is inversely related to the group's electron-withdrawing (deactivating) strength. A stronger deactivating group leads to a lower para yield. The order of deactivating strength is -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5. Thus, the order of increasing para yield will be Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** For substances with ortho, para-directing groups (-CH3, -C2H5, -Cl), the para-isomer is a major product. The distribution between ortho and para isomers is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier group will favor the less crowded para position more. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3), so ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para yield than toluene (1). The chloro group (-Cl) is also an ortho, para-director, which, due to its electronic properties, strongly favors the para position, resulting in an even higher para yield than the alkylbenzenes. Thus, the order of increasing para yield is Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n3.  **Combine and Finalize:** By combining the two ranked groups, with all meta-directors having lower para yields than all ortho, para-directors, we get the final sequence. I will write a Python script to formalize this logic, sort the substances, and identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomer_yield_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry problem by encoding chemical principles into data\n    and processing it.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the substances with their properties.\n    # The key property is the expected percentage yield of the para-isomer,\n    # estimated from known principles of electrophilic substitution.\n    # Data: (Substance ID, Chemical Formula, Estimated % para-isomer yield)\n    substance_data = [\n        # Meta-directors: Very low para yield.\n        # Order is based on deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n        (4, 'C6H5-NO2', 0.3),  # Strongest deactivator, lowest para yield.\n        (6, 'C6H5-COOH', 1.0),  # Strong deactivator.\n        (2, 'C6H5-COOC2H5', 2.0),  # Deactivator, weaker than -COOH.\n\n        # Ortho, para-directors: High para yield.\n        # Order is based on steric and electronic effects.\n        (1, 'C6H5-CH3', 67.0),  # Base case for small alkyl group.\n        (5, 'C6H5-C2H5', 70.0),  # Bulkier alkyl group increases para yield due to sterics.\n        (3, 'C6H5-Cl', 89.0)  # Halogens are strongly para-directing.\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the substances by their estimated para-isomer yield in ascending order.\n    # The `key` for sorting is the third element of each tuple (the yield).\n    sorted_substances = sorted(substance_data, key=lambda x: x[2])\n\n    # Step 3: Extract the IDs from the sorted list to get the final order.\n    sorted_order_ids = [item[0] for item in sorted_substances]\n\n    # Step 4: Format the result as a string.\n    order_string = ' < '.join(map(str, sorted_order_ids))\n\n    # Step 5: Identify the correct option from the given choices.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5\",\n        \"B\": \"6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3\",\n        \"C\": \"3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4\",\n        \"D\": \"4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\"\n    }\n\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, value in options.items():\n        if value == order_string:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    print(\"The substances arranged in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield are:\")\n    print(order_string)\n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to option: {correct_option}\")\n\nsolve_isomer_yield_problem()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
