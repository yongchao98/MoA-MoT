    "Of course, I can help you with this physics problem. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\nFirst, I will apply the principle of **conservation of relativistic energy**. This principle states that the total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The system starts with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which is a common physics problem simplification meaning we can neglect its kinetic energy and assume it's at rest. Therefore, the initial energy is simply the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{p}c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 = 2 \\cdot m_{p}c^2$\n\n2.  **Express the Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** After the annihilation, the system consists of four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. They all have the same mass, $m_A$. By conservation of momentum (assuming the initial system was at rest), the final particles must fly off in such a way that their total momentum is zero. This implies by symmetry that they all have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$. The total energy of a single moving particle A is $\\gamma m_{A}c^2$. So, the total final energy is:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\cdot (\\gamma m_{A}c^2)$\n\n3.  **Solve for Velocity:** By equating the initial and final energies, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    $2 \\cdot m_{p}c^2 = 4 \\cdot \\gamma m_{A}c^2$\n    Once $\\gamma$ is known, we can find the velocity, $v$, using the relativistic formula:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    We will solve for the ratio $\\beta = v/c$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the rest energies of the particles in MeV.\n# The rest energy of a proton is a known physical constant.\nm_proton_c2 = 938.27  # MeV\n# The rest energy of particle A is given in the problem.\nm_A_c2 = 300.0  # MeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total initial energy of the system.\n# Assuming the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest, the initial energy\n# is the sum of their rest energies.\ninitial_energy = 2 * m_proton_c2\n\n# Step 3: Set up the energy conservation equation.\n# The final energy is 4 * (total energy of one particle A).\n# Total energy of one particle A = gamma * m_A_c2\n# So, initial_energy = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# We can solve this for the Lorentz factor, gamma.\ngamma = initial_energy / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Step 4: Solve for the velocity (v) as a fraction of the speed of light (c).\n# The fraction is beta = v/c. The formula is beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\nbeta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))\nbeta = math.sqrt(beta_squared)\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and compare with the given options.\nprint(\"--- Calculation Steps ---\")\nprint(f\"Initial Energy (2 * m_p * c^2): {initial_energy:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz Factor (gamma) for particle A: {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity of particle A (as a fraction of c): {beta:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\nprint(f\"The calculated velocity is approximately {beta:.2f}c.\")\nprint(\"Comparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.77c\")\nprint(\"B) 0.91c\")\nprint(\"C) 0.96c\")\nprint(\"D) 0.86c\")\nprint(\"\\nThe result 0.77c matches option A.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
