    "To solve this problem, we will determine the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, that results from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is described by the following equilibrium:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca-EDTA^{2-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$, also given as KCa-EDTA) for this reaction is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[Ca-EDTA^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe are starting with a stoichiometric solution of the complex, which will slightly dissociate back into its constituent ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation:\n$Ca-EDTA^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Set Up an Equilibrium Table (ICE Table)**\n\nLet's define 'x' as the concentration of the complex that dissociates. At equilibrium:\n*   $[Ca^{2+}]$ = x\n*   $[EDTA^{4-}]$ = x\n*   $[Ca-EDTA^{2-}]$ = (Initial Concentration) - x = 0.02 - x\n\n**3. Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\n\nSubstitute these values back into the formation constant expression:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}}$\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # Molar concentration of Ca-EDTA\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\n\n# From the simplified equilibrium expression: K_f = initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# We solve for x, where x = [Ca^2+]\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# x = sqrt(x^2)\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of calcium ions [Ca^2+] is: {x:.2e} M\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\n\n# Determine which option is the closest\noptions = {'A': 6.3e-7, 'B': 2.0e-2, 'C': 1.0e-2, 'D': 5.0e-3}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - x))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {x:.2e} M is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
