    "This problem can be solved using the principle of relativistic velocity addition.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference**:\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame (S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving frame (S').\n\n2.  **Define the velocities**:\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame (glass) relative to the stationary frame (lab) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *within* the moving frame (i.e., relative to the glass) is `u'`. According to the definition of the index of refraction `n`, the speed of light in the glass is `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, we have `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula**:\n    The formula to find the velocity `u` of the object (the light beam) in the stationary frame (lab) is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify**:\n    Now, substitute the known values (`u' = 1/n` and `c=1`) into the formula:\n    `u = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Algebraic simplification**:\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Match the result with the options**:\n    The derived expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform this symbolic derivation and find the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_relativistic_velocity_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the speed of light in a moving medium\n    relative to a stationary observer using symbolic mathematics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables\n    n, v, c, u, u_prime = sympy.symbols('n v c u u_prime')\n\n    # 1.
