    "My plan is to analyze the provided spectral data step-by-step to deduce the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** I will first look at the molecular weight and isotope pattern. The M+ peak at m/z=156 gives the molecular weight, and the ratio of the M+ (156) to the M+2 (158) peak will tell me if a halogen like chlorine or bromine is present. A ~3:1 ratio is characteristic of one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** I will analyze the key absorption peaks. A very broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly indicative of an O-H bond in a carboxylic acid. A strong peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl (C=O) group, which, when combined with the O-H evidence, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n3.  **Proton NMR (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:** I will examine the chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integration of the signals.\n    *   A signal far downfield (above 10 ppm) is typically from a carboxylic acid proton.\n    *   Signals in the 7-8.5 ppm range are from aromatic protons. The splitting pattern (e.g., doublets) and integration (number of protons for each signal) will reveal the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Specifically, a symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing 2 protons, strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) disubstitution.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By combining these pieces of information, I will evaluate the four given options (A, B, C, D) and eliminate those that do not match the data. The structure that is consistent with all spectral evidence will be the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectral data to identify an unknown chemical compound from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the provided spectral data ---\n    analysis = []\n    analysis.append(\"Analysis of the Spectral Data:\")\n    analysis.append(\"=\"*35)\n\n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    analysis.append(\"1.
