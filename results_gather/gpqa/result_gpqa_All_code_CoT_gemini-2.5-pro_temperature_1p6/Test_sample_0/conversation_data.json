    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics Principle:** The problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty or \"broadening\" in its energy (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. For calculation purposes, we can approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n2.  **Identify Constants and Given Values:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Broadening (ΔE) for Each State:**\n    *   For state 1: ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   For state 2: ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    The state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy broadening. This larger broadening is the dominant factor in determining if the states can be distinguished.\n\n4.  **Establish the Resolution Criterion:** To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly larger than their energy broadenings. A common criterion is that the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be at least as large as the larger of the two energy broadenings (ΔE₁ or ΔE₂).\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Calculate the required minimum energy separation based on the larger energy broadening. Then, compare this value to the given options (A, B, C, D) to find which one is a plausible energy difference for clear resolution. The correct option must be greater than the calculated minimum separation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\n# Reduced Planck constant (h-bar) in eV*s\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two quantum states in seconds\nlifetime1_s = 1e-9\nlifetime2_s = 1e-8\n\n# Options for the energy difference in eV\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"This program determines the required energy difference to resolve two quantum states.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 75)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy uncertainty (broadening) for each state\n# The formula is derived from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: delta_E * delta_t >= h_bar\n# We use delta_E_min = h_bar / delta_t to find the minimum energy broadening.\nenergy_broadening1_eV = h_bar_eV_s / lifetime1_s\nenergy_broadening2_eV = h_bar_eV_s / lifetime2_s\n\nprint(f\"The lifetime of state 1 is {lifetime1_s:.1e} s.\")\nprint(f\"The energy broadening (uncertainty) of state 1 is: Delta_E1 = {energy_broadening1_eV:.3e} eV.\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"The lifetime of state 2 is {lifetime2_s:.1e} s.\")\nprint(f\"The energy broadening (uncertainty) of state 2 is: Delta_E2 = {energy_broadening2_eV:.3e} eV.\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Establish the condition for resolution\n# To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" the two energy levels, their energy difference\n# must be larger than their energy broadenings.
