    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant**: The first step is to determine the molecular structure and formula of the reactant, \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention for `cyclo...carboxylic acid` names, this group is on carbon C1.\n    *   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is on C2.\n    *   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is on C5.\n    *   Based on this structure, we can count the atoms to find the molecular formula: C10H12O3.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction**: The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P / HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids and aldehydes) and all carbon-carbon double bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms. Crucially, it does not break open the cycloalkane ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product**: We apply the reduction to each part of the reactant molecule:\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The result is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon count doesn't change, the product will have 10 carbons. A saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula C(n)H(2n). Therefore, the product's formula is C10H20.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**: The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) tells us the sum of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   We can calculate it for the product (C10H20) using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1.\n    *   Plugging in the values gives IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 1.\n    *   This IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the final cyclohexane product.\n\n```python\n# Final Answer Code\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the reactant and product based on chemical principles.\n# The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n# A step-by-step analysis of the name reveals its molecular formula is C10H12O3.\n\n# Step 2: Understand the reaction with Red P / HI.\n# This reagent completely reduces aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and C=C double bonds\n# to the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts. The ring structure is preserved.\n# - Carboxylic acid (-COOH) -> Methyl group (-CH3)\n# - Aldehyde (-CHO) -> Methyl group (-CH3)\n# - Vinyl group (-CH=CH2) -> Ethyl group (-CH2CH3)\n# - The C=C in the ring -> C-C single bond\n# This means all double bonds and oxygen atoms are removed, and the molecule becomes fully saturated, except for its ring structure.\n\n# Step 3: Determine the formula of the product.\n# The number of carbons remains 10. The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a\n# monocyclic saturated hydrocarbon. The general formula for such a compound is C(n)H(2n).\n# Therefore, the product's molecular formula is C10H20.\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n# The IHD formula is: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 (for a hydrocarbon).\nnum_carbons = 10\nnum_hydrogens = 20\n\n# Calculate IHD\nindex_of_hydrogen_deficiency = num_carbons - (num_hydrogens / 2) + 1\n\n# Print the final result and the corresponding choice\nprint(f\"The molecular formula of the final product is C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}.\")\nprint(f\"The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as C - H/2 + 1.\")\nprint(f\"IHD = {num_carbons} - ({num_hydrogens}/2) + 1 = {int(index_of_hydrogen_deficiency)}\")\nprint(\"This IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of one ring in the product molecule.\")\nprint(\"The correct option is A.\")\n<<<A>>>\n```"
