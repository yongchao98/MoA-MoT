    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to identify the correct compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction using the provided 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The starting material has the formula C11H12O, and a rearrangement reaction will result in a product with the same formula.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is highly characteristic of a **ketone** (C=O) carbon. This confirms the reaction is an epoxide rearrangement to a ketone.\n    *   The signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two different saturated carbons.\n    *   The signals in the δ 126.9-144.1 ppm range correspond to aromatic and alkene carbons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates two different **methyl (CH3) groups** that are not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is a classic signature of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. One of the substituents is likely a methyl group (the p-tolyl group), which accounts for one of the methyl singlets.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These are two doublets, each for 1 proton. They are coupled to each other, which is characteristic of a disubstituted alkene (**-CH=CH-**).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a p-tolyl group (CH3-C6H4-). This accounts for one methyl singlet and the para-substituted ring signals.\n    2.  We have a ketone group (C=O).\n    3.  We have another methyl group (CH3).\n    4.  We have a -CH=CH- group.\n\n    Let's assemble these fragments to match the formula C11H12O. The most logical structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    Structure: `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n    This structure is an α,β-unsaturated ketone and perfectly matches all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is a rearrangement of an epoxide (Compound X) into the product we identified, 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This type of reaction is known as a vinyloxirane rearrangement. We need to find the vinyloxirane that would rearrange to this specific ketone.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** (`C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`) - Has a phenyl group (`C6H5-`), not a p-tolyl group (`CH3-C6H4-`). The product would be 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** (`C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH3`) - Has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Also, it's not a terminal epoxide, so the rearrangement would likely lead to a different product. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** (`C6H5-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2`) - Has a phenyl group instead of p-tolyl and a different alkene structure. The product would be 3-methyl-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, which does not match the NMR data (e.g., it would have an alkene singlet, not two doublets). This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** (`CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`) - This is a terminal vinyloxirane containing a p-tolyl group. Its rearrangement through a dienol intermediate (`CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH2`) and subsequent tautomerization yields exactly our deduced product, 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one (`CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`). This matches all observations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, as it is the only precursor that would form the product consistent with the provided NMR spectra under the reaction conditions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the reasoning for identifying Compound X.\n    1.
