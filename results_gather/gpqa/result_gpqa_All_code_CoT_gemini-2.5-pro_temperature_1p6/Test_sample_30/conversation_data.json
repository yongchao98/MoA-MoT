    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** I will determine the product of treating toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). I will consider the directing effects of the methyl group and the possibility of multiple nitrations to ensure the final answer aligns with the given options.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** I will identify the product when the result from step 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. This is a strong oxidizing agent, and I will determine its effect on the molecule.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** I will determine the product when the result from step 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. This involves an acid (the product from step 2) and a strong base (NaOH). I'll identify the most likely chemical transformation.\n4.  **Determine the Symmetry of the Final Product:** Once the structure of the final product (Product 3) is established, I will analyze its molecular geometry and identify all its symmetry elements (like rotation axes, mirror planes, center of inversion).\n5.  **Assign the Point Group:** Based on the identified symmetry elements, I will assign the correct molecular symmetry point group to Product 3.\n6.  **Select the Final Answer:** I will match the determined point group with the given options (A, B, C, D) and output the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.\")\nprint(\"This is a nitration reaction.
