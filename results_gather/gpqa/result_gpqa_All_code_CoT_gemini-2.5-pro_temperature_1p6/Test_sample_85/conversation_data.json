    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I am given two chemical reactions and asked to identify the correct starting materials (A and B) from a list of four options.\n\n    *   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n2.  **Analyze the Products:**\n    *   The products of both reactions are stereoisomers (enantiomers) of each other.\n    *   The product is \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\". This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The \"pyran\" part tells me it's a 6-membered ring containing one oxygen atom. The \"-2-one\" tells me there's a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2, making it an ester within the ring.\n    *   The only difference is the stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4, which has an ethyl group attached. Reaction 1 gives the (R) enantiomer, and Reaction 2 gives the (S) enantiomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Starting Material Options:**\n    *   All options are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n    *   Let's break down this structure:\n        *   `pentanoic acid`: A 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n        *   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) at C3. This makes C3 a chiral center.\n        *   `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo`: At C5, there is an isobutyl ester group (-COO-isobutyl).\n    *   So, the general structure is: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CO-O-isobutyl(5).\n    *   This molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a single chiral center at C3.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (A → (R)-lactone):**\n    *   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a mild reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters and aldehydes/ketones, but it does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n        *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-isobutyl  --LiBH₄→ HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    *   **Second Step (H⁺):** The addition of acid (H⁺) protonates the system and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The -OH group (from the reduced ester at C5) attacks the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid (at C1) to form a 6-membered ring (the lactone).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. In the final lactone product, the original C3 of the acid chain becomes the C4 of the pyran-2-one ring.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyl...lactone, and the stereochemistry is preserved, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration at its chiral center. Therefore, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (B → (S)-lactone):**\n    *   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids over esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n        *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-isobutyl  --BH₃→ HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-isobutyl\n    *   **Second Step (H⁺):** The addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed -OH group attacks the carbonyl of the ester, displacing isobutanol to form the 6-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Again, these reaction steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. This C3 becomes the C4 in the final lactone product.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyl...lactone, and the stereochemistry is preserved, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Therefore, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Final Synthesis:**\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n7.  **Code Formulation:**\n    *   I will create a Python script to formalize this reasoning.\n    *   I'll state the key facts about the reagents' selectivity.\n    *   I'll deduce the structure of A based on Reaction 1.\n    *   I'll deduce the structure of B based on Reaction 2.\n    *   Finally, I'll print the option that matches these deductions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the correct starting materials for two reduction reactions.\n\n    The problem involves two separate reactions with different reducing agents leading\n    to enantiomeric products. The key to solving this is understanding the selectivity\n    of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n    Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n    The starting materials are isomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid,\n    which has the structure: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-isobutyl.\n    This molecule has two reducible groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester\n    (-CO-O-isobutyl). The chiral center is at carbon 3.\n\n    Step-by-step analysis:\n    1.  Analyze Reaction 1:\n        - Reagent: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n        - Transformation: The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol. The molecule becomes a hydroxy-acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH.\n        - Cyclization: The subsequent acid workup (H+) causes the hydroxy group to attack the carboxylic acid, forming a six-membered lactone.\n        - Stereochemistry: The reduction and cyclization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material, which corresponds to C4 in the lactone product.\n        - Conclusion for A: To form the (R)-lactone, starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    2.  Analyze Reaction 2:\n        - Reagent: BH3 (Borane) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n        - Transformation: The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol. The molecule becomes a hydroxy-ester: HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-isobutyl.\n        - Cyclization: The acid workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the new hydroxy group attacks the ester to form the lactone.\n        - Stereochemistry: This process also preserves the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center, which becomes C4 in the product.\n        - Conclusion for B: To form the (S)-lactone, starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    3.  Combine Results:\n        - A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n        - B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n    4.  Match with Options:\n        A) A = (R), B = (R) - Incorrect\n        B) A = (R), B = (S) - Correct\n        C) A = (S), B = (S) - Incorrect\n        D) A = (S), B = (R) - Incorrect\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Based on the chemical analysis:\n    # A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    # B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    # This corresponds to option B.\n    \n    final_choice = 'B'\n    print(f\"Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents:\")\n    print(\"Reaction 1: LiBH4 reduces the ester.
