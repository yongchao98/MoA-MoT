    "Of the choices provided, Superstring Theory is the one conjectured to be free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, thus not requiring the procedure of regularization. My plan is to explain this in the python code by briefly analyzing each option.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Options**: I will assess each theory's relationship with high-energy divergences and the need for regularization.\n    *   **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) & Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: These are Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) where interactions are modeled with point particles. Calculations involving quantum loops in these theories lead to infinities that must be \"regularized\" and then \"renormalized\" to yield finite, physical predictions.\n    *   **Classical Electrodynamics**: This is not a quantum theory. While it has its own divergence problems (like the infinite self-energy of a point charge), it does not have the kind of high-energy quantum loop divergences that regularization is primarily designed to address in the context of QFT.\n    *   **Superstring Theory**: A key feature and motivation for Superstring Theory is that its fundamental entities are extended one-dimensional strings, not point particles. This extended nature is believed to naturally \"smear out\" interactions at very small distances, thereby avoiding the ultraviolet divergences that plague standard QFTs. For this reason, it is thought to be UV-finite and not require regularization.\n2.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that prints the question, the options, a step-by-step analysis of why Superstring Theory is the correct choice, and finally state the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_correct_theory():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided physics theories to determine which one does not require\n    regularization at high energies and prints the conclusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Quantum Chromodynamics',\n        'B': 'Classical Electrodynamics',\n        'C': 'Superstring Theory',\n        'D': 'Quantum Electrodynamics'\n    }\n\n    print(question + \"\\n\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}) {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Reasoning ---\")\n    print(\"Regularization is a mathematical technique used to handle infinite quantities that arise in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) calculations, especially at high energies (known as ultraviolet divergences).\\n\")\n    print(\"A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): As a QFT, QCD suffers from ultraviolet divergences in loop calculations and definitively requires regularization and renormalization.\")\n    print(\"B) Classical Electrodynamics: This is a classical, not quantum, theory.
