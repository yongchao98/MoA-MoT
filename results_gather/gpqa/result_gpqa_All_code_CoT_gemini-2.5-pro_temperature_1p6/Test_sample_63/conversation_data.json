    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data**: I will use the mass and volume changes from the experiment to determine the moles of each gaseous product formed when the salt mixture was heated.\n2.  **Identify the Gaseous Products**:\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The fact that the Ca(OH)₂ tube's weight did not change means no acidic gases like CO₂ were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with hot copper is due to the mass of oxygen atoms stripped from an oxidizing gas. Based on common chemical decompositions, this gas is likely nitrous oxide (N₂O), which decomposes on hot copper to form N₂ and solid CuO (`Cu + N₂O -> CuO + N₂`).\n    *   The final remaining gas (Gas C) is an inert gas, which must be nitrogen (N₂).\n3.  **Determine Stoichiometry**: I will calculate the moles of the initial products (H₂O, N₂O, and any initially formed N₂) based on the data.\n4.  **Identify the Salts**: I will look for two common salts (A and B) that, when mixed in equimolar amounts and heated, would decompose to produce the calculated moles of H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. The likely candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), as their decomposition reactions (`NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O` and `NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`) perfectly match the identified products.\n5.  **Calculate Final Atom Count**: Once the chemical formulas for salts A and B are confirmed, I will count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B and add them together to get the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define initial data from the problem statement.\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g, this is the mass of H2O\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80  # g, this is the mass of Oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with Cu\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24  # L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure)\n\n# Step 2: Define necessary constants and molar masses.\nMOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O = 15.999    # g/mol for a single oxygen atom\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the moles of the substances involved.\n# Moles of water (H2O) produced, absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2 in tube №1.\nn_h2o = mass_increase_tube1 / M_H2O\n\n# Moles of Oxygen atoms that reacted with hot copper in tube №3.\n# The reaction is Cu + N2O -> CuO + N2. The mass increase is from the O atom.\n# Therefore, moles of reacting Oxygen atoms equals moles of the original N2O gas.\nn_N2O = mass_increase_tube3 / M_O\n\n# Moles of final gas C (N2) remaining.\nn_gas_C_final = volume_gas_C / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n# Step 4: Determine the moles of the initial gaseous products.\n# The final N2 gas (Gas C) is composed of N2 initially produced from the salts plus the N2 formed from the decomposition of N2O in tube №3.\n# The moles of N2 from N2O is equal to the moles of N2O.\nn_N2_from_N2O = n_N2O\nn_N2_initial = n_gas_C_final - n_N2_from_N2O\n\n# So, the heating of the salt mixture produced approximately:\n# - 0.2 mol of H2O\n# - 0.05 mol of N2 (initial)\n# - 0.05 mol of N2O\n\n# Step 5: Identify the salts A and B.\n# We need two salts in an equimolar mixture (let's say x moles each) to produce these products.\n# Let's test the decomposition of ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate:\n# Reaction A: NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O\n# Reaction B: NH4NO3 -> N2O + 2H2O\n# If we have x moles of NH4NO2 and x moles of NH4NO3:\n# Total N2 produced = x moles (matches n_N2_initial ≈ 0.05 mol)\n# Total N2O produced = x moles (matches n_N2O ≈ 0.05 mol)\n# This implies x = 0.05 mol.\n# Let's check the amount of water:\n# Total H2O = (2*x from A) + (2*x from B) = 4*x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This matches n_h2o.\n# The identification is consistent. Salt A is NH4NO2 and Salt B is NH4NO3.\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\n# Atoms in NH4NO2: N=2, H=4, O=2\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\n# Atoms in NH4NO3: N=2, H=4, O=3\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# The total number of atoms is the sum of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Based on the analysis, salt A is NH4NO2 and salt B is NH4NO3.\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH4NO2): {atoms_in_A}\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH4NO3): {atoms_in_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B combined: {total_atoms}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the choices:\")\nprint(\"A) 17\")\nprint(\"B) 15\")\nprint(\"C) 13\")\nprint(\"D) 19\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated total number of atoms is {total_atoms}, which corresponds to choice A.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
