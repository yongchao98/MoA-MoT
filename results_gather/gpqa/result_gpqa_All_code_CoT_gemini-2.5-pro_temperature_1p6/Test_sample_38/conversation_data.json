    "To solve this problem, we need to apply a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics known as the Born rule. The Born rule states that the probability of finding a particle in a given region of space is determined by the integral of the square of the absolute value of its wave function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that region. Since the problem states that the particles are always found between x=1 and x=3, the total probability of finding a particle in this interval must be 1.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Wave Function:** The wave function is given as a complex function: `ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i`.\n2.  **Calculate the Probability Density:** The probability density is `|ψ(x)|²`. For any complex number `z = Re + i*Im`, its squared absolute value is `|z|² = Re² + Im²`.\n    *   The real part is `Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`.\n    *   The imaginary part is `Im(ψ) = -0.5`.\n    *   Therefore, `|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`.\n3.  **Set up the Normalization Integral:** The condition that the particle must be found between x=1 and x=3 means the integral of the probability density over this range is equal to 1.\n    *   `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n4.  **Solve the Integral:** We can solve this integral analytically.\n    *   `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1`\n    *   The first part evaluates to `a² * [ln(1+x)]` from 1 to 3, which is `a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² * ln(2)`.\n    *   The second part evaluates to `[0.25*x]` from 1 to 3, which is `0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.5`.\n5.  **Solve for 'a':** The equation becomes `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`.\n    *   `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    *   `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    *   `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** The following Python code will calculate the value of 'a' and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem requires solving for 'a' from the normalization condition:\n# Integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n# where |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25.\n#\n# Solving the integral analytically leads to the equation:\n# a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n#\n# Rearranging to solve for 'a':\n# a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2)\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n# Calculate the value of 'a' using numpy\na = np.sqrt(0.5 / np.log(2))\n\n# Print the result and the given options\nprint(f\"The calculated numerical value of 'a' is: {a:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 0.85\")\nprint(f\"B) 1.1\")\nprint(f\"C) 0.35\")\nprint(f\"D) 0.6\")\n\n# Find the closest option\noptions = {'A': 0.85, 'B': 1.1, 'C': 0.35, 'D': 0.6}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - a))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\nprint(f\"Final choice: {closest_option}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
