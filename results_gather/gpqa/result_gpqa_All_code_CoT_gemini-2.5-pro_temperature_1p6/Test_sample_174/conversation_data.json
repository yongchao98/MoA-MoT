    "The problem describes the radiation from an oscillating spheroid, which can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. Let's break down the two parts of the question: the angular dependence and the wavelength dependence of the radiated power.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence:** The power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from an oscillating electric dipole along the z-axis is given by the formula: `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle from the z-axis.\n2.  **Maximum Power (A):** The maximum power is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians). Thus, `A` corresponds to the power at `θ = 90°`.\n3.  **Power at θ = 30°:** We need to calculate the power at `θ = 30°` and find its fraction relative to the maximum power `A`. This fraction will be `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)`.\n4.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence:** The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency `ω` (Power `∝ ω⁴`). The frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the power dependence on wavelength is Power `∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`. This is the basis of Rayleigh scattering.\n5.  **Conclusion:** We will combine the results from the angular and wavelength dependence analysis to determine the correct option.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate the fraction based on the angular dependence and then state the wavelength dependence to identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Part 1: Angular Dependence ---\n\n# The power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²(θ).\n# dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)\n\n# The maximum power, A, occurs at θ = 90 degrees, where sin²(90°) = 1.\n# So, A = K * 1.\n\n# We need to find the power radiated at an angle of 30 degrees.\n# First, convert 30 degrees to radians to use with numpy's sin function.\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(30)\n\n# Calculate the value of sin²(30°).\npower_factor_at_30_deg = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\n# The fraction of the maximum power A is (K * sin²(30°)) / (K * sin²(90°)).\n# This simplifies to sin²(30°), since sin²(90°) = 1.\nfraction = power_factor_at_30_deg\n\n# --- Part 2: Wavelength Dependence ---\n\n# The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to ω⁴, where ω is the angular frequency.\n# Power ∝ ω⁴\n# Since ω = 2πc/λ, we have Power ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴.\n# This means the form of the function f includes a λ⁻⁴ term.\n\n# --- Part 3: Conclusion ---\n\n# Let's check the options based on our findings.\n# We found the fraction is 1/4 (since sin(30) = 0.5, and 0.5² = 0.25).\n# We found the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴.\n\n# Options:\n# A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n# B) 1/4, λ⁻³\n# C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n# D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n# Our result matches option A.\n\nprint(f\"The angle in degrees is: 30\")\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power radiated at this angle is sin^2(30°) = {fraction:.2f}, which is 1/4.\")\nprint(\"The form of the function f has a wavelength dependence of λ^(-4).\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the given choices:\")\nprint(\"A) 1/4, λ^(-4) -> This matches our result.\")\nprint(\"B) 1/4, λ^(-3)\")\nprint(\"C) 1/2, λ^(-4)\")\nprint(\"D) 3/4, λ^(-6)\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct choice is A.\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
