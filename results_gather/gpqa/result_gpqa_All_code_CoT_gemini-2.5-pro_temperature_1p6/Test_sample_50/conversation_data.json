    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a powerful technique in electrostatics.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the System**: We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n2.  **Apply Method of Images**: The electric field outside the sphere, and thus the potential energy, can be calculated by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific position `b` inside the sphere. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, satisfying the \"grounded\" condition.\n3.  **Determine Image Charge and Position**: For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n4.  **Calculate Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the original charge `q` in the field of the induced charges on the sphere is calculated. This is **not** simply the interaction energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct formula for the energy of interaction is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n5.  **Find the Potential**: `V_induced` at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`. The distance between the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n6.  **Substitute and Solve**: Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the formula for `V_induced`, and then substitute that result into the formula for the potential energy `U`. Simplify the final expression and compare it to the given options.\n\nThe following Python code will implement this step-by-step derivation to find the correct formula.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Let's use sympy for symbolic representation to make the steps clear.\nk, q, R, d = sympy.symbols('k q R d')\n\n# Step 1: Define the image charge (q_prime) and its position (b)\n# from the center of the sphere, according to the method of images.\nq_prime = -q * R / d\nb = R**2 / d\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Define Image Charge and Position\")\nprint(f\"Image charge q' = {q_prime}\")\nprint(f\"Image position b = {b}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: The potential energy U of the system is given by U = (1/2) * q * V_induced,\n# where V_induced is the potential at the location of charge q due to the\n# induced charges on the sphere.
