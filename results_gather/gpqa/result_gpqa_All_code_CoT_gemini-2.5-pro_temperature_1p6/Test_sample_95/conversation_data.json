    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the entropy of the black hole from its observed angular size and distance. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Convert Units:** The given distance is in parsecs and the angular size is in degrees. We need to convert these to standard SI units (meters and radians, respectively) for use in our physics formulas.\n2.  **Calculate the Event Horizon Radius (Rs):** We can relate the angular size (θ), distance (d), and the actual size (in this case, the event horizon radius, Rs) using the small-angle approximation: `Rs ≈ d * θ` (where θ is in radians).\n3.  **Calculate the Entropy (S):** With the radius of the event horizon, we can calculate the entropy using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula relates entropy (S) to the surface area (A) of the event horizon. A simplified version of the formula that uses Rs directly is: `S = (π * k_B * c³ * Rs²) / (G * ħ)`, where:\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `ħ` (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n4.  **Compare the Result:** Finally, we will compare the order of magnitude of our calculated entropy with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute these steps and find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and given values.\n# Physical Constants\nG = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nc = 2.99792458e8 # Speed of light (m/s)\nk_B = 1.380649e-23 # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34 # Reduced Planck constant (J·s)\npc_to_m = 3.0857e16 # Parsec to meter conversion\n\n# Given values from the problem\nd_pc = 10**10      # Distance in parsecs\ntheta_deg = 10**-17  # Angular size in degrees\n\n# Step 2: Convert distance from parsecs to meters and angular size from degrees to radians.\nd_m = d_pc * pc_to_m\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the radius of the event horizon (Rs) using the small-angle approximation.\nRs = d_m * theta_rad\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the entropy of the black hole using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n# S = (pi * k_B * c^3 * Rs^2) / (G * hbar)\nentropy = (math.pi * k_B * (c**3) * (Rs**2)) / (G * hbar)\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result and the options to determine the order of magnitude.\nprint(f\"The calculated radius of the event horizon is: {Rs:.4e} meters.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated entropy of the black hole is: {entropy:.4e} J/K.\")\nprint(\"\\nOptions:\")\nprint(\"A) 10^66 J/K\")\nprint(\"B) 10^62 J/K\")\nprint(\"C) 10^65 J/K\")\nprint(\"D) 10^59 J/K\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated entropy is on the order of 10^62 J/K, which corresponds to option B.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
