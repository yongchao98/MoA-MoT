    "Here is my plan to solve this special relativity problem:\n1.  **Identify the knowns:**\n    *   The relative velocity (`v`) between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time measured in the ejecta's frame (the proper time, `t_0`) is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light (`c`) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Apply the concept of Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the Galaxy (the \"stationary\" frame), time for the moving ejecta appears to pass more slowly. We need to calculate how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame (`t`) while 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor (gamma) is: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `t = γ * t_0`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Distance:** Once we find the time `t` in the Galaxy's reference frame, we can calculate the distance the ejecta travels in that frame using the standard formula: `distance = velocity * time` or `d = v * t`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and compare the result with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the known values from the problem statement.\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (v) in km/s.\nv = 60000\n# Proper time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (t_0) in seconds.\nt0 = 50\n# Speed of light (c) in km/s.\nc = 300000\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma).\n# The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2)).\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (t).\n# The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t_0.\nt_galaxy_frame = gamma * t0\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n# The formula is distance = velocity * time.\ndistance_galaxy_frame = v * t_galaxy_frame\n\n# Print the final calculated distance and the options.\nprint(f\"The calculated distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is: {int(round(distance_galaxy_frame))} km.\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 2 880 000 km.\")\nprint(\"B) 3 060 000 km.\")\nprint(\"C) 2 940 000 km.\")\nprint(\"D) 3 000 000 km.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
