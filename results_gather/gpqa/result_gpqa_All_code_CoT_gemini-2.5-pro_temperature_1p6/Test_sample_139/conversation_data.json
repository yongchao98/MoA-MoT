    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point given is ~277 K. In Celsius, this is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is a very close match and fits the clue about a \"heavier isotope\". So, B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify G, W, and Y:**\n    *   Since heating precipitate G releases B (D₂O), G must be a compound that decomposes to yield D₂O, such as a deuterated metal hydroxide.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the context of deuterium, a strong candidate is deuterium gas, D₂. A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The reaction X + Y → W + G is described as violent. A violent reaction that produces D₂ gas and a metal hydroxide precipitate suggests X is a powerful reducing agent (like a metal hydride or deuteride) and Y is the source of deuterium atoms for the D₂ gas, making Y likely D₂O.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The clue about organic chemistry is key. X reacts with a keto acid (which has a ketone C=O and a carboxylic acid -COOH group, totaling at least 3 oxygen atoms) to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates a strong reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohol groups (-OH).\n    *   Common reducing agents in organic chemistry are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). LiAlH₄ is powerful enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids, while NaBH₄ typically is not.\n    *   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, and Substance X, which contains a heavier isotope, must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's check this hypothesis: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This reaction is indeed violent and produces all the identified products.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H). Deuterium (D) is the isotope ²H.\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen. The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The problem asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements present in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum in the formula. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Its mass is 27.\n    *   **Lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is 2. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Mass of Al) + (Mass of all D atoms) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify the substances based on chemical properties.\n# Substance B has a melting point near 277 K (3.82 °C), which corresponds to heavy water, D₂O.\n# This implies the involvement of the heavy isotope Deuterium (D).\n# The gas W with equal protons and neutrons is D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n# The precipitate G releases D₂O upon heating, suggesting a deuterated hydroxide, likely Al(OD)₃.\n# This points to a reaction of a strong deuteride agent with D₂O.\n\n# Step 3: Identify Substance X.\n# X is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry that can reduce a keto acid to a diol (product with 2 oxygens).\n# The common reagent for this is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n# The problem states X contains a heavier isotope, so X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄.\n# The formula of Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses.\n# The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n# Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic mass.\n# H (atomic mass ~1), Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (atomic mass ~27).\n# Lightest element: Hydrogen\n# Heaviest element: Aluminum\n\n# Use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes in the molecule LiAlD₄.\n# The isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Mass number = 27.\n# The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H or D). Mass number = 2.\n\n# Calculate the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# Mass contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum):\n# There is 1 atom of Aluminum.\nmass_of_Al = 27\n\n# Mass contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen):\n# There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\nmass_of_D_atoms = 4 * 2\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass.\ncumulative_mass = mass_of_Al + mass_of_D_atoms\n\n# Print the final result.\nprint(\"Substance X is identified as LiAlD₄.\")\nprint(\"The elements are Li, Al, and H (as isotope D).\")\nprint(\"The lightest element is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminum.\")\nprint(\"Mass of the Aluminum atom (²⁷Al):\", mass_of_Al)\nprint(\"Mass of the four Deuterium atoms (⁴ x ²H):\", mass_of_D_atoms)\nprint(\"The cumulative atomic mass is:\", cumulative_mass)\n\n# The options are A) 35, B) 25, C) 29, D) 31.\n# Our calculated result is 35, which corresponds to option A.\nprint(\"The final answer is 35.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
