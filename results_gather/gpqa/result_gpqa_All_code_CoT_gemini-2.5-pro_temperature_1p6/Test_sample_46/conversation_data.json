    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to understand the number of rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n    The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)`, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, N is nitrogens, and X is halogens.\n    For C9H11NO2:\n    `DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 10 - 5 = 5`.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (which accounts for 1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A primary amine has two N-H bonds, leading to two distinct stretching frequencies (asymmetric and symmetric).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the context of the DBE and the NMR data, this is very likely an ester C=O.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and the `t` (triplet) multiplicity means they are adjacent to a CH2 group. This is the methyl (-CH3) part of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and the `q` (quartet) multiplicity means they are adjacent to a CH3 group. This is the methylene (-CH2-) part of the same ethyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this -CH2- is attached to an electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. Combining this with the peak at 1.20 ppm, we have an ethoxy group, likely part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is highly characteristic of the protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield, meaning they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   Putting all the pieces together: We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Let's check this against the given options:\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This would be an ester on the oxygen (`C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3`), not the carbon. The propionate's -CH2- would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a *meta*-substituted ring, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern. It is also an amide, not an ester attached to the ring.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR, not two.\n    *   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula (C9H11NO2), the primary amine and ester from IR, and the ethyl group, para-substituted ring, and amine protons from the NMR.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data Provided:\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = \"medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1; strong band at 1720 cm-1\"\n    nmr_data = \"1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"B\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-Step Analysis:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula\n    # DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 5\n    print(\"1.
