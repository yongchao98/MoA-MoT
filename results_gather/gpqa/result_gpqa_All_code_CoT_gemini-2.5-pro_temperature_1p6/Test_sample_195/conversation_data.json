    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.** In a closed system, the total energy remains constant. For a relativistic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of its relativistic mass-energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and its potential energy ($U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$).\n2.  **Define the total energy at the point of maximum displacement.** At the amplitude $x=A$, the oscillator momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$. At $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is equal to 1. The total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the maximum potential energy.\n3.  **Define the total energy at the equilibrium position.** At the equilibrium position $x=0$, the potential energy is zero. The oscillator reaches its maximum speed, $v=v_{max}$. The total energy is purely the relativistic energy of the mass moving at $v_{max}$.\n4.  **Equate the two energy expressions.** By setting the total energy at maximum displacement equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position, we can establish a relationship between the system parameters and the maximum speed.\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.** We will algebraically manipulate the resulting equation to isolate $v_{max}$ and express it in terms of the given variables ($m$, $k$, $A$, $c$).\n6.  **Compare the result with the given choices.** The final derived expression for $v_{max}$ will match one of the multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_relativistic_oscillator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the derivation for the maximum speed of a \n    1-D relativistic harmonic oscillator and prints the correct answer choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: State the principle of conservation of total relativistic energy.\n    print(\"Step 1: The total energy E of the oscillator is conserved.\")\n    print(\"E = (relativistic energy of mass) + (potential energy)\")\n    print(f\"E = gamma * m * c^2 + (1/2) * k * x^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the total energy at maximum displacement (x = A).\n    print(\"Step 2: At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity v = 0.\")\n    print(\"When v = 0, gamma = 1.\")\n    print(\"So, the total energy is E_at_A = (1) * m * c^2 + (1/2) * k * A^2\")\n    print(\"E_at_A = m*c^2 + (1/2)kA^2\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total energy at the equilibrium position (x = 0).\n    print(\"Step 3: At the equilibrium position x = 0, the speed is maximum (v = vmax).\")\n    print(\"The potential energy is 0.\")\n    print(\"The Lorentz factor is gamma_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - vmax^2/c^2).\")\n    print(\"So, the total energy is E_at_0 = gamma_max * m * c^2 + 0\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Equate the energies to find an expression for gamma_max.\n    print(\"Step 4: By conservation of energy, E_at_A = E_at_0.\")\n    print(\"m*c^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = gamma_max * m * c^2\")\n    print(\"Dividing by m*c^2 gives:\")\n    print(\"1 + (kA^2) / (2*m*c^2) = gamma_max\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Use the definition of gamma to solve for vmax.\n    print(\"Step 5: Now, solve for vmax using the definition of gamma_max.\")\n    print(\"gamma_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - vmax^2/c^2)\")\n    print(\"Squaring both sides: gamma_max^2 = 1 / (1 - vmax^2/c^2)\")\n    print(\"Rearranging for vmax: 1 - vmax^2/c^2 = 1 / gamma_max^2\")\n    print(\"vmax^2/c^2 = 1 - (1 / gamma_max^2)\")\n    print(\"vmax = c * sqrt(1 - (1 / gamma_max^2))\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 6: Substitute the expression for gamma_max back into the equation for vmax.\n    print(\"Step 6: Substitute the expression for gamma_max from Step 4.\")\n    print(\"vmax = c * sqrt(1 - (1 / (1 + (kA^2)/(2*m*c^2))^2))\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 7: Compare the result with the given options.\n    print(\"Step 7: Comparing our derived formula with the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) vmax = c * sqrt(1 + 1/((1 - kA^2/(2m))^2)) -> Incorrect\")\n    print(\"B) vmax = c * sqrt(1 - 1/((1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2)) -> Correct\")\n    print(\"C) vmax = sqrt(kA^2/m) -> Incorrect (This is the non-relativistic limit)\")\n    print(\"D) vmax = c * sqrt(1 + 1/((1 - kA^2/(2mc^2)))) -> Incorrect\")\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    final_choice = 'B'\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct option is {final_choice}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the solution\nsolve_relativistic_oscillator()\nprint(\"\\n<<<B>>>\")\n```"
