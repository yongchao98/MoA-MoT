    "This is a quantum mechanics problem concerning atomic transitions in a Hydrogen atom. I will solve this by applying the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and calculating the branching ratio for the specified decay path.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state with principal quantum number $n=2$. This is a cascade decay involving two electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules:** For an electric dipole (E1) transition, the changes in the quantum numbers must obey the following rules:\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (change in orbital angular momentum quantum number).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (change in magnetic quantum number).\n\n3.  **Analyze the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Intermediate state: $n'=2$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l' - l = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' - m = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   This means there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   Final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   From any of the intermediate states ($l'=1$), the change in $l$ is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in $m$ is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, the possible values for $\\Delta m$ are $+1, 0, -1$, all of which are allowed.\n    *   Therefore, all three paths identified are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    *   We need the probability of one specific path, for instance, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$. This is the branching ratio of the first decay step.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   The decay process involves the emission of a photon. Due to the initial state's symmetry, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the available and energetically degenerate final substates, which are distinguished by the magnetic quantum number $m'$.\n    *   There are 3 possible channels for the first decay: to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. Since they are equally likely, the probability for any one of them is $1/3$.\n    *   For the second step, the intermediate state (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$, a 2p state) can only decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via a dipole transition. There are no other allowed lower-energy states. Thus, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n    *   The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $P = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:** The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols for explanation.\n# Note: The calculation is based on theoretical principles, not numerical computation.\n# This code serves to explain the steps and print the final conclusion.\n\n# Step 1: Define the selection rules for electric dipole transitions.\n# Delta_l = +/- 1\n# Delta_m = 0, +/- 1\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,l',m'>.\n# The initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0).\n# According to the selection rules, the intermediate orbital quantum number l' must be 1.\n# The magnetic quantum number m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n# This gives three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the branching ratio for the first transition.\n# Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial |3,0,0> state, the transition\n# probability is equal for each of the three possible m' sublevels.\n# Number of channels = 3.\n# Probability for one specific channel = 1 / (Number of channels).\nprob_step1 = sympy.Rational(1, 3)\n\n# Step 4: Analyze the second transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0>.\n# The intermediate state, for example |2,1,0>, is a 2p state.
