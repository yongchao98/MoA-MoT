    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents points towards an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is alpha-bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile, and the bromine atom is on a primary carbon, making it a good substrate for an SN2 reaction. The cyanide will displace the bromide.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   Structure: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic ring-forming reaction, similar to the malonic ester synthesis for cyclic compounds.\n    1.  The protons on the CH2 group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). The strong base, NaH, deprotonates this carbon to form a carbanion (enolate).\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  The intermediate product still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. The excess NaH deprotonates this carbon again.\n        *   NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2\n    4.  The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, which still has a bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that closes the ring. The ring will consist of the 5 carbons from the pentane chain plus the alpha-carbon from the ester, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with one carbon atom (C1) substituted with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of all the protons in the molecule. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, implying we should not simplify or assume accidental equivalence.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:**\n    *   The molecule has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH2CH3) on C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Because the two substituents are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or axis of rotation. Even considering rapid chair-flipping, there is no symmetry element that would make one side of the ring equivalent to the other.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is asymmetric (though it is achiral).\n\n2.  **Protons of the Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are enantiotopic. Since the molecule is achiral and they are not adjacent to a stereocenter, their replacement with a test group would create enantiomers. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n3.  **Protons of the Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The ring consists of five CH2 groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   **Equivalence of the CH2 Groups:** Due to the lack of symmetry in the molecule, all five CH2 groups are in chemically different environments. C2 is not equivalent to C6, C3 is not equivalent to C5, and C4 is unique.\n    *   **Equivalence of Protons within each CH2 Group:** For any given CH2 group on the ring (e.g., at C2), the two protons are diastereotopic. This is because they are in an asymmetric environment, and there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the H-C-H angle. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   Therefore, each of the five distinct CH2 groups on the ring will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from ring = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nEach of the 12 sets of protons is chemically distinct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
