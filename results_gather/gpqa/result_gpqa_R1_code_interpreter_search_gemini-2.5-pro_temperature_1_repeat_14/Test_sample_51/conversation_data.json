    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes between an unspotted star and a spotted star. This factor is `(N2/N1)_unspotted / (N2/N1)_spotted`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Therefore, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels (E1 and E2) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `N₂`, `N₁` are the number of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1.\n    *   `g₂`, `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `E₂`, `E₁` are the energies of the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the local temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Factor:** We need to find the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at two different temperatures. Let `R(T) = N₂ / N₁` at temperature `T`. The factor is `R(T_unspotted) / R(T_spotted)`.\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_unspotted)] ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spotted)] ]\n\n    The statistical weights term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out. Let `ΔE = E₂ - E₁`.\n    Factor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)]\n    Using the property `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    Factor = exp[ - (ΔE / k) * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\n\n4.  **Identify the Temperatures:** The problem provides the effective temperatures for the two stellar states:\n    *   `T_unspotted` = 6000 K (the temperature of the unspotted star's photosphere).\n    *   `T_spotted` = 5500 K (the *overall* effective temperature when spots are present).\n    The most straightforward interpretation, common in such problems, is to use these effective temperatures as the characteristic temperatures for the Boltzmann equation for each state. The additional information about spot coverage (40%) and stellar radius/mass is likely extraneous detail intended to test the understanding of which values are relevant.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k):** The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition wavelength `λ` by the formula `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is the Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the term `ΔE/k` can be calculated as `(h * c) / (λ * k)`.\n    *   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:** Now, substitute all the values into the factor equation. I will use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given values from the problem\nlambda_angstrom = 1448\nlambda_m = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10  # Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters\n\nT_unspotted = 6000  # Effective temperature of the unspotted star in K\nT_spotted = 5500    # Overall effective temperature of the spotted star in K\n\n# Calculate the term Delta_E / k\ndelta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (lambda_m * k)\n\n# Calculate the factor using the Boltzmann equation ratio\n# Factor = exp[ (Delta_E / k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\nexponent = delta_E_over_k * (1 / T_spotted - 1 / T_unspotted)\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated factor is: {factor:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated factor is: 4.51\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of populations `(N2/N1)` in the unspotted star is approximately 4.51 times higher than the ratio corresponding to the effective temperature of the spotted star. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star is unspotted compared to when it is spotted. This can be expressed as:\n\nFactor = (N₂/N₁)unspotted / (N₂/N₁)spotted\n\nThe population of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ = ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nWhen we take the ratio of the population ratios for the two different stellar states (unspotted and spotted), the statistical weights term (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))]\n\nUsing the property of exponents exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nFactor = exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted)]\nFactor = exp[(ΔE/k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted)]\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   Temperature of the unspotted star's photosphere, T_unspotted = 6000 K.\n*   Overall effective temperature of the spotted star, T_spotted = 5500 K.\n*   The transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\nThe energy difference ΔE is related to the wavelength λ by the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light. We can calculate the term ΔE/k:\n\nΔE/k = (hc) / (λk)\n\nWe can substitute the values for the physical constants (h, c, k) and the given wavelength and temperatures into the equation for the factor. The Python code executed in the previous step performed this calculation:\n\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   **Temperatures:**\n    *   T_unspotted = 6000 K\n    *   T_spotted = 5500 K\n*   **Wavelength:**\n    *   λ = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nThe code calculated the exponent:\nexponent = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted)\n\nAnd then the final factor:\nfactor = exp(exponent)\n\nThe output of the code was `4.51`. This value represents the factor by which the ratio of populations (N₂/N₁) is larger in the unspotted (hotter) star compared to the spotted (cooler) star. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ~4.5\nB) ~2.9\nC) ~1.1\nD) ~7.8\n\nThe calculated value of 4.51 is closest to ~4.5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
