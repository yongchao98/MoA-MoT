    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle**: The problem revolves around the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that it's impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and the exact time it exists in that state. A shorter lifetime (Δt) for a state leads to a larger uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE).\n\n2.  **State the Formula**: The mathematical relationship for the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For estimations and determining the minimum resolvable difference, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the energy uncertainty (also known as the natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Values**:\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in the required units (eV·s) is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**: We need to calculate the energy spread (ΔE) for each state using its lifetime.\n    *   **For State 1**:\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2**:\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution**: To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the width of the energy levels. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂). Therefore, this broader linewidth is the limiting factor for resolution. The energy difference between the two states must be significantly larger than this dominant linewidth.\n    *   Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    *   Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options**: We need to find the option that satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV   (This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV   (This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV   (This is much larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Only option D (10⁻⁴ eV) provides an energy separation that is substantially larger than the energy uncertainty of the broader state, allowing the two levels to be clearly distinguished.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a python script.\n```python\n# Value of the reduced Planck constant in eV.s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\n# Delta_E is approximately hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (shorter lifetime): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (longer lifetime): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be larger\n# than the dominant (larger) energy uncertainty, which is delta_E1.\nprint(f\"\\nRequired energy difference must be > {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check the options\noption_A = 1e-11\noption_B = 1e-8\noption_C = 1e-9\noption_D = 1e-4\n\nprint(f\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nprint(f\"Option A (1e-11 eV): {'Resolvable' if option_A > delta_E1 else 'Not resolvable'}\")\nprint(f\"Option B (1e-8 eV): {'Resolvable' if option_B > delta_E1 else 'Not resolvable'}\")\nprint(f\"Option C (1e-9 eV): {'Resolvable' if option_C > delta_E1 else 'Not resolvable'}\")\nprint(f\"Option D (1e-4 eV): {'Resolvable' if option_D > delta_E1 else 'Not resolvable'}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states that ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. This principle implies that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt, also denoted as τ) does not have a perfectly defined energy but rather an energy spread or uncertainty (ΔE), often called the natural linewidth. For practical calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Lifetime of the first state, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n*   Lifetime of the second state, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n*   The reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**2. Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:**\n*   For state 1: ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   For state 2: ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n**3. Determine the condition for distinguishability:**\nTo \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be larger than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (state 1, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). This larger linewidth is the limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the energy separation between the two levels must be greater than this dominant linewidth.\n*   Required condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Compare the options with the required condition:**\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to be clearly resolved from the natural linewidth of the states.\n\n<<<D>>>"
