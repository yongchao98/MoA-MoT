    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a particle annihilation process. The fundamental principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The reaction is $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$.\n    *   We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a crucial piece of information. It implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can approximate its initial momentum as zero.\n    *   Assuming the proton is the stationary target, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero. This means the reaction is observed in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total energy in the initial state is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Total initial energy, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   From the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must be zero, just like the initial momentum.\n    *   The total energy in the final state is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. Since they all have the same mass and the total momentum is zero, it is symmetric to assume they will all be moving with the same speed, $v_A$, and thus have the same relativistic energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n    *   Total final energy, $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Lorentz factor (Î³):**\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the given values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n6.  **Solve for the velocity (v_A):**\n    *   The relationship between the Lorentz factor and velocity is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$, where $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n7.  **Final result:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation using a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300     # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# According to the conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final\n# E_initial = 2 * m_p_c2 (proton and antiproton at rest)\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2 (four A particles with the same speed)\n\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\ngamma = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now, solve for beta (v/c) using the formula: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\n# Print the result\n# print(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"{beta}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning for the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The core principle governing this annihilation process is the conservation of total relativistic energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n2.  **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. In such a scenario, we can consider the reaction in the center-of-mass frame, where the total initial momentum is zero, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two particles.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is $E_p = m_p c^2$. From a standard data table, this value is approximately $938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so its rest energy is also $E_{\\bar{p}} = m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy is $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n\n3.  **Final State Analysis:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    *   Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The rest energy of particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum was zero), the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. By symmetry, the four particles will share the available energy equally, meaning they will all have the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same total relativistic energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a single particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Applying Energy Conservation:**\n    *   We equate the initial and final energies: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   We can solve this equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substituting the known values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity $v_A$ using the definition of $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Thus, the velocity of particle A is $v_A = 0.7688c$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This corresponds to option C.\n\nThe Python code execution confirms this calculation. The output `0.7688120760232829` rounds to `0.77`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
