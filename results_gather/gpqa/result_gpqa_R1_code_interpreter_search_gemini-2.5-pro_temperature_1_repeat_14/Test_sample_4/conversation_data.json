    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the normalized eigenvector.\n\n**1. Define the Quantum Mechanical Operator**\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is a vector operator with components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$. These are given in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) as:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThis is the standard spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n**2. Define the Operator Along the Direction  $\\vec{n}$**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector of the operator corresponding to the direction $\\vec{n}$. This operator, let's call it $P_n$, is the dot product of $\\vec{P}$ and the unit vector $\\vec{n}$.\nThe direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle from the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane).\nFor a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, which means we can set the azimuthal angle $\\phi = 0$.\nSo, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nThe operator $P_n$ is:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n\nSubstituting the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe are looking for the eigenvector, let's call it $\\chi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n \\chi = \\lambda \\chi$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n**4. Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$\\chi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nFor the eigenvector to be properly normalized, its norm must be 1. That is, $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\nLet's choose a convenient form for the eigenvector by setting $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Then:\n$b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo the eigenvector is $\\chi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nLet's check its normalization:\n$|\\chi|^2 = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\nThe vector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect dimensions and form.\nB) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect, depends on $\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$.\nC) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect dimensions and factors.\nD) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - This matches our derived result."
