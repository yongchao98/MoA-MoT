    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the products and the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane is a highly symmetric tricyclic alkane (tricyclo[3.3.1.1^3,7]decane).\n*   **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh, basic conditions that can promote complex rearrangements and eliminations.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   Formula: The starting material is C10H14Br2. The product is described as a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This means the carbon skeleton and hydrogen count (C10H14) are retained. The bromine atoms are replaced by a single oxygen atom, so the formula is **C10H14O**.\n    *   Degree of Unsaturation (DoU): For C10H14O, DoU = (2*C + 2 - H)/2 = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 8/2 = 4.\n    *   IR Spectrum: A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group, likely in a six-membered ring or a similarly unstrained environment. A ketone accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   1H NMR Spectrum:\n        *   4.79 ppm (2H): This chemical shift is in the alkene region. A signal for 2 equivalent protons strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH2) where a plane of symmetry bisects the C=C bond, making the two vinylic protons equivalent. This accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n        *   2.41-2.23 ppm (10H): A complex multiplet for the majority of the aliphatic protons.\n        *   1.94 ppm (2H): A signal for two other equivalent protons.\n*   **Structural Deduction for Product 1:**\n    *   The molecule has a C=O group and a C=C group. This accounts for 2 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   The total DoU is 4, so there must be 4 - 2 = 2 rings.\n    *   Therefore, Product 1 is a **bicyclic enone** with the formula C10H14O.\n    *   The reaction involves a rearrangement of the tricyclic adamantane skeleton into a bicyclic one. Rearrangement of adamantane derivatives often leads to compounds with a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)3.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** Product 2 is formed by the reduction of the ketone group in Product 1 to a hydroxyl (alcohol) group. The double bond is unaffected. So, Product 2 is a **bicyclic unsaturated alcohol** (C10H16O).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O3) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. Ozone cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The DMS workup converts the intermediate ozonide into aldehydes or ketones.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** Since Product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis will cleave it. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH2) from Product 1 (and 2) will be converted into a carbonyl group (C=O). The original ketone group from Product 1, which was reduced to an alcohol (-CH-OH) in Product 2, remains unchanged. Therefore, Product 3 is a **bicyclic hydroxy-ketone**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3.**\n\n*   **Identifying the Proton:** In Product 3 (a hydroxy-ketone), the most deshielded proton (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) will be the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C-OH). Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm, which is significantly more deshielded than protons alpha to a ketone (typically 2.2-2.8 ppm).\n*   **Determining the Coupling:** The coupling pattern (splitting) of this H-C-OH proton is determined by the number of adjacent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule (for simple cases). These adjacent protons are the ones on the carbon atoms that were alpha (α) to the carbonyl group in Product 1.\n*   **Inferring the Local Structure:** To determine the number of alpha protons, we need to deduce the structure of the ketone in Product 1. While the exact overall structure of Product 1 is complex to determine from the given information alone, we can make a strong inference about the local environment of the ketone.\n    *   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is highly symmetric. Rearrangements of symmetric molecules often lead to products that retain a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   A plausible structure for the core of the rearranged product is based on bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. Let's consider a ketone in this framework, for instance, at the C3 position. This ketone is located in a six-membered ring, consistent with the IR data (1720 cm⁻¹).\n    *   In a symmetric structure like `bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one`, the ketone at C3 is flanked by two CH2 groups (at C2 and C4). This is a **-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-** moiety.\n    *   When this ketone is reduced to an alcohol (-CH(OH)-), the proton on C3 becomes coupled to the four protons on the adjacent C2 and C4 carbons.\n*   **Predicting the Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   The H-C(OH) proton is coupled to four neighboring protons.\n    *   In a chair-like ring system, the adjacent protons are not all magnetically equivalent. The two axial-like protons will have one coupling constant (J_ax), and the two equatorial-like protons will have another (J_eq).\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two axial-like protons are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons are equivalent to each other.\n    *   Therefore, the H-C(OH) signal will be split into a triplet by the two axial-like protons (n=2, n+1=3). Each line of this triplet will be further split into another triplet by the two equatorial-like protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis logic holds even if the true structure is a C10 analog (like bicyclo[3.3.2]decenone or bicyclo[4.3.1]decenone) as long as it retains the key structural feature: a ketone in a symmetric environment flanked by two CH2 groups. This leads to the H-C-OH proton being coupled to two distinct pairs of protons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
