    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\n\n*   The starting material is cyclohexanone. The first reaction is with bromine (Br₂). This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Without specified conditions (acidic or basic catalysis), this reaction can be ambiguous. However, for such problems, we should consider plausible, high-yield transformations.\n*   If we assume mono-bromination, we get 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   If we assume exhaustive bromination under conditions that favor it, we might get poly-brominated products. A common product from vigorous bromination is 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Let's keep both possibilities in mind and see which one leads to a sensible final answer.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\n\nThis step is crucial as the pathway diverges significantly depending on the structure of Product 1.\n\n*   **Scenario A: Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n    *   Treating an α-halo ketone with a strong base like NaOH can lead to two main reactions:\n        1.  **Elimination:** Formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which would be **cyclohex-2-en-1-one**.\n        2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** Ring contraction to form a cyclopentane derivative. The product would be **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (after workup).\n    *   Let's follow the Favorskii path, as it's often dominant for α-halocyclohexanones.\n\n*   **Scenario B: Product 1 is 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone.**\n    *   Treating a 2,2-dihalocyclohexanone with a base also leads to a Favorskii-type rearrangement, resulting in ring contraction. The reaction of 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone with NaOH is a known route to **cyclopent-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid**. This pathway seems specific and well-defined.\n\nLet's pursue Scenario B, as it involves a very specific and known transformation.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 2:** The reaction is a quasi-Favorskii rearrangement. The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring. The product is **cyclopent-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n\n*   Product 2 is cyclopent-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid.\n*   The reagent is thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) with pyridine. This is the standard set of reagents for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride).\n*   The reaction converts the -COOH group to a -COCl group.\n*   **Product 3:** cyclopent-1-ene-1-carbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n\n*   Product 3 is cyclopent-1-ene-1-carbonyl chloride.\n*   The reagent is Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃). This is a mild, bulky reducing agent. It is famously used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, as it is not reactive enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   The -COCl group is reduced to a -CHO (aldehyde) group.\n*   **Product 4:** cyclopent-1-ene-1-carbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique proton signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of **cyclopent-1-ene-1-carbaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n       H-C=O\n       |\n    C1==C2-H\n    |      |\n C5H2---C3H2\n     \\   /\n      C4H2\n    ```\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** The molecular formula is C₆H₈O. There are 8 hydrogen atoms in total.\n    *   1 aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   1 vinylic proton (on C2).\n    *   2 protons on C3.\n    *   2 protons on C4.\n    *   2 protons on C5.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To determine how many of these are chemically distinct, we look for symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule is **achiral**.\n    *   However, it does **not** possess any simple symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a C₂ rotation axis that would make different groups of protons equivalent.\n    *   Let's examine each position:\n        1.  **Aldehyde Proton (H-CHO):** This proton is unique. (Signal 1)\n        2.  **Vinylic Proton (H-C2):** This proton is adjacent to the C1-CHO group and C3. It is unique. (Signal 2)\n        3.  **Protons on C5 (H₂-C5):** This is an allylic methylene group, adjacent to the C1-CHO carbon. The two protons on C5 are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships with the rest of the asymmetric molecule) and are therefore chemically non-equivalent. They will produce two distinct signals. (Signals 3 & 4)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 (H₂-C3):** This is also an allylic methylene group, but it's adjacent to the C2-H carbon. Its chemical environment is different from C5. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. (Signals 5 & 6)\n        5.  **Protons on C4 (H₂-C4):** This methylene group is adjacent to C3 and C5. Since C3 and C5 are different, the two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and non-equivalent. (Signals 7 & 8)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since there is no symmetry to make any of these protons equivalent, all 8 hydrogen atoms are in chemically distinct environments. Therefore, the molecule will show **8** signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThis result matches one of the given options. The reaction sequence is chemically sound and leads unambiguously to this answer."
