    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Data:**\n    *   **1H NMR:** Two peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   This means the proton exists in two distinct chemical environments.\n        *   The integrals are roughly equal, suggesting the two environments are populated in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n        *   The total integral is 1H, confirming these two peaks represent a single proton in the molecule.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting is not due to neighboring protons.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC).\n        *   This confirms there are two distinct chemical species that can be separated based on their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n        *   They have equal intensities, which correlates with the equal integrals in the NMR.\n        *   Both peaks give the same mass spectrum (MS), which matches the expected product. This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are **isomers** â€“ they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight, but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Double coupling is a procedural step to drive a reaction to completion. It would result in *more* of the desired single product, not a mixture of two isomers. If it caused a side reaction to form a dimer, for instance, the mass spectrum would be different (double the expected mass). This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same chemical formula and mass.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** Because they are not mirror images, diastereoisomers have different spatial relationships between their atoms. This results in different chemical environments for their nuclei. Therefore, they are expected to have different NMR spectra (e.g., different chemical shifts for the same proton in each isomer). This perfectly explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC Properties:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point, solubility). Because of this, they can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography techniques like LC. This explains the two peaks in the LC chromatogram.\n        *   **MS Properties:** Since they have the same formula, they have the same mass, which explains why the mass spectrum is identical for both LC peaks.\n        *   **Context:** In peptide chemistry, diastereomers can arise in two common ways: 1) if one of the starting amino acids was not enantiomerically pure (e.g., a mix of L- and D-forms was used), or 2) through restricted rotation about the amide bond, creating stable *cis* and *trans* conformers (also known as atropisomers, which are a type of diastereomer). Both scenarios fit the description perfectly.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material or an intermediate) would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data, showing both peaks have the mass of the *expected product*, directly refutes this explanation.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical chemical shifts and would produce only a single set of peaks.\n        *   **LC Properties:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are also indistinguishable and will elute as a single peak.\n        *   The observation of two peaks in both NMR and LC definitively rules out enantiomers as the explanation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that is consistent with all the provided data (two peaks in NMR, two peaks in LC, and identical mass for both peaks) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
