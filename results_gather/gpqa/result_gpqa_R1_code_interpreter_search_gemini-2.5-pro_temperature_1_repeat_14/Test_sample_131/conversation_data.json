    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Check the molecular formula of the options:**\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (TMB):** Benzene is C6H6. Replacing 4 hydrogens with 4 methyl (CH3) groups gives C6H2(CH3)4, which simplifies to C10H14. All three TMB isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) have the correct formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Benzene is C6H6. Replacing 2 hydrogens with 2 ethyl (C2H5) groups gives C6H4(C2H5)2, which simplifies to C10H14. This also has the correct formula.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound:**\nThe key is to use molecular symmetry to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent protons, which corresponds to the number of signals.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, and the four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   The ethyl group would produce a **quartet** (for the CH2) and a **triplet** (for the CH3) due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   The problem states all signals are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds. This eliminates option **D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, coupling between equivalent protons is not observed, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives a second signal (6H).\n        *   Therefore, there are **two singlets (6H each)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, giving one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique, giving a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique, giving a third signal (3H).\n        *   Therefore, there are **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H, corresponding to a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**4. Analyze the mixture based on the individual spectra:**\n\nWe need a 1:1 mixture that results in:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two 1:1 singlets. Since each of the three TMB isomers gives one aromatic singlet (2H), a 1:1 mixture of any two will give two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H = 1:1). This condition is met by options A, B, and C.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the integrals of the three peaks correspond to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: Three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This does not match the required three signals with a 12H:6H:6H integration.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined signals: This gives a total of exactly three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: This would naturally produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). To get the observed three signals, it would require an accidental overlap (identical chemical shift) of two non-equivalent signals. While not impossible, the scenario in option B provides a direct and unambiguous explanation without requiring such a coincidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that naturally produces the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
