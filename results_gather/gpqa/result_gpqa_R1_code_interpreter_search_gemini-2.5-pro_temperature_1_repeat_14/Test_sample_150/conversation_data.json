    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the probability of measuring a specific outcome (0) for an observable `P` when the system is in a given state `|ψ⟩`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Principles of Quantum Mechanics:**\n    *   The possible outcomes of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.\n    *   The state of the system is represented by a state vector `|ψ⟩`. In this problem, `|ψ⟩` is given as a column matrix `[-1, 2, 1]`.\n    *   The observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix `P`. In this problem, `P` is the matrix with rows `(0, 1/√2, 0)`, `(1/√2, 0, 1/√2)`, and `(0, 1/√2, 0)`.\n    *   The probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the formula:\n        `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n        where:\n        *   `v_λ` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n        *   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product (or dot product) of the eigenvector `v_λ` and the state vector `|ψ⟩`.\n        *   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the state vector with itself, which is the squared norm of the state vector. This term is necessary because the given state vector `|ψ⟩` might not be normalized.\n\n3.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 3.1: Find the eigenvalues of the operator P.**\n        The eigenvalues `λ` are the solutions to the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n        ```\n        P - λI = | -λ    1/√2    0   |\n                  | 1/√2   -λ    1/√2 |\n                  |  0    1/√2   -λ   |\n        ```\n        The determinant is:\n        `det(P - λI) = -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) + 0`\n        `= -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2)`\n        `= -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2`\n        `= -λ³ + λ`\n        Setting the determinant to zero:\n        `-λ³ + λ = 0`\n        `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n        `λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0`\n        The eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\n\n    *   **Step 3.2: Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest (λ = 0).**\n        We need to find the vector `v₀` such that `(P - 0*I)v₀ = 0`, or `Pv₀ = 0`.

    "This problem requires us to apply the principles of quantum mechanics to find the probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n\n**1. Understand the Theory**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator representing that observable. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n\n`P(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\nWhere:\n*   `λ` is the eigenvalue of interest (in this case, 0).\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the state vector with itself, which serves to normalize the probability if the initial state `|ψ⟩` is not normalized.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   The state vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n*   The observable operator: `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The measurement outcome of interest: `λ = 0`\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 3.1: Find the eigenvalues of P to confirm 0 is a possible outcome.**\nWe solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n```\ndet | -λ    1/√2    0   |\n    | 1/√2   -λ    1/√2 | = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ\n    |  0    1/√2   -λ   |\n```\nSetting `λ - λ³ = 0`, we get `λ(1 - λ²)=0`. The solutions (eigenvalues) are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. So, 0 is a possible measurement outcome.\n\n**Step 3.2: Find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.**\nWe need to solve the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let the eigenvector be `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n```\n| 0    1/√2    0   | |x|   |0|\n| 1/√2   0    1/√2 | |y| = |0|\n| 0    1/√2    0   | |z|   |0|\n```\nThis gives us a system of equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nAn un-normalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]ᵀ`. To normalize it, we divide by its norm: `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector is `|v₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ`.\n\n**Step 3.3: Calculate the probability.**\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` (the squared norm of the state vector):**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n*   **Calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n    `= (1/√2)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1)`\n    `= -1/√2 - 1/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2`\n\n*   **Calculate the squared magnitude `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`:**\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-√2)² = 2`\n\n*   **Calculate the final probability:**\n    `P(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 2 / 6 = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\nComparing this result with the options provided:\nA) 1\nB) 2/3\nC) \\sqrt{2/3}\nD) 1/3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
