    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` to the total mass of `system_2`, i.e., `M_tot1 / M_tot2`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n        *   It is an eclipsing binary.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n        *   It is an eclipsing binary.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_tot = M1 + M2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2) by the following formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_tot = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i))`\n    where:\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is a crucial piece of information. Eclipses can only occur if the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula to: `M_tot ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G)`\n\n5.  **Formulate the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `M_tot1 / M_tot2`.\n    `M_tot1 / M_tot2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2 * pi * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2 * pi * G) ]`\n\n    The constants `2`, `pi`, and `G` cancel out, leaving a simpler expression for the ratio:\n    `M_tot1 / M_tot2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]^3`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Calculate:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocities for system 1: `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   Sum of velocities for system 2: `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n    Now, plug these values into the ratio formula:\n    `M_tot1 / M_tot2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)^3`\n    `M_tot1 / M_tot2 = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n    `M_tot1 / M_tot2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M_tot1 / M_tot2 = 54 / 125`\n\n    To make it easier to compare with the options, let's calculate the decimal value.\n    `M_tot1 / M_tot2 = 0.432`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is 0.432.\n    *   A) ~ 1.2\n    *   B) ~ 0.7\n    *   C) ~ 0.4\n    *   D) ~ 0.6\n\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo verify the calculation, a simple Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_sum = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # years\nK2_sum = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M_tot1 / M_tot2)\n# The formula is (P1/P2) * ((K1_sum)/(K2_sum))^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms the result of the calculation is 0.432, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The calculation is complete and confirmed by the code execution.\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system 1 to system 2 is calculated as:\nRatio = (P1 / P2) * ((K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b))^3\nRatio = (2 / 1) * ((10 + 5) / (15 + 10))^3\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\nRatio = 2 * (0.6)^3\nRatio = 2 * 0.216\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.432 is closest to the value in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
