    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both equations. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2)] / [(R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2)]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets, a2 / a1.\n\n4.  **Connecting Radial Velocity (RV) to Orbital Parameters:** The problem provides the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (also known as the RV semi-amplitude, K_star) by the formula:\n    K_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\n    where `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K_star = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_orb\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_orb is the planet's orbital velocity, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n    Since the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on from our perspective, meaning the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, and thus sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    The orbital velocity for a circular orbit is v_orb = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a). Since a planet's mass is typically much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), we can approximate v_orb ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a).\n\n    Substituting these into the K_star formula:\n    K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the above formula to solve for `a`:\n    K_star^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we form the ratio for `a` for the two planets:\n    a2 / a1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\n\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n7.  **Calculating Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** From K_star = c * Δλ / λ_0, the ratio K_star1 / K_star2 is:\n        K_star1 / K_star2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n        Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n        K_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substituting Values:** Now we substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio:** Finally, we calculate the temperature ratio using the result from step 3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the decimal value, we can use a simple Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nM_p1_earth = 7  # Planet 1 mass in Earth masses\nM_p2_earth = 5  # Planet 2 mass in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2_earth / M_p1_earth\n\n# Ratio of stellar RV semi-amplitudes (K_star1 / K_star2)\n# This is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nK_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes squared (a2/a1) is given by:\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K_star1/K_star2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.54\n<<<D>>>",
    "**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)\nT_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). When we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [ (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) ] / [ (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) ]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to Semi-Major Axis:**\nThe problem provides the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ), which are related to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) by K_star ∝ Δλ.\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit (which is stated in the problem) and detected by transit (implying sin(i) ≈ 1) is given by:\nK_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass and M_star is the star's mass.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK_star^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na ≈ G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nNow we can form the ratio of `a` for the two planets. The constants G and M_star will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [ G * M_p2^2 / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ G * M_p1^2 / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values:**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 M_Earth\n    M_p2 = 5 M_Earth\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K_star1 / K_star2):**\n    This ratio is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Calculate a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**7.

    "The user's question requires calculating the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two exoplanets. Here is the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n**1. Define the Goal:**\nThe objective is to compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Effective temperature of the star\n*   R_star = Radius of the star\n*   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n*   A = Albedo of the planet\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio for the two planets:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are identical for both. It is also given that they have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem is now simplified to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits. Note that information like the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii are not needed for this ratio calculation as they cancel out.\n\n**4. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) by the Doppler formula:\nK_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nThis implies that K_star is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem) detected via the transit method (which implies the inclination `i` is ~90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1), the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\nK_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nWhere M_p is the planet's mass and M_star is the star's mass.\n\n**5. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis `a`:**\nWe can rearrange the formula for K_star to solve for `a`:\nK_star^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nNow we can create the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) will cancel out.\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n**7. Substitute Known Values:**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K_star1 / K_star2):**\n    As K_star is proportional to Δλ, this ratio is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Calculate a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nFinally, we substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nComparing this result to the given options, 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
