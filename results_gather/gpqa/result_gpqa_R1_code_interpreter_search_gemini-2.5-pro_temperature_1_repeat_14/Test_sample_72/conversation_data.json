    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given two astronauts with different masses moving at different relativistic speeds in the same direction. We need to find two quantities:\n*   The relative speed between them.\n*   The total energy of the two-astronaut system.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1 (m₁): 2m\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1 (v₁): 0.6c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2 (m₂): 3m\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2 (v₂): 0.5c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the velocities are relativistic, we cannot simply subtract them. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative velocity. For two objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂ / c²))\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c\n*   v₂ = 0.5c\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857... c\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\n\n**Calculate the energy of Astronaut 1 (E₁):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 (γ₁):\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - v₁²/c²)\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(0.64)\n    γ₁ = 1 / 0.8\n    γ₁ = 1.25\n\n*   Now, calculate the energy E₁:\n    E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c²\n    E₁ = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\n    E₁ = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Calculate the energy of Astronaut 2 (E₂):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 (γ₂):\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - v₂²/c²)\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(0.75)\n    γ₂ = 1 / (√3 / 2)\n    γ₂ = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547\n\n*   Now, calculate the energy E₂:\n    E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c²\n    E₂ = (2 / √3) * (3m) * c²\n    E₂ = (6 / √3) * mc²\n    To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n    E₂ = (6√3 / 3) * mc²\n    E₂ = 2√3 * mc²\n    Using the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n    E₂ ≈ 2 * 1.732 * mc²\n    E₂ ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):**\n*   Add the individual energies:\n    E_total = E₁ + E₂\n    E_total = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²\n    E_total = (2.5 + 2√3) mc²\n    E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc²\n    E_total ≈ 5.964 mc²\n    Rounding to two decimal places, we get **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\nc = 1.0  # Speed of light\nm = 1.0  # Rest mass unit\n\n# --- Astronaut 1 ---\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# --- Astronaut 2 ---\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Part 1: Calculate Relative Speed ---\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2)\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2))\nprint(f\"Relative speed in terms of c: {v_rel/c:.2f}c\")\n\n# --- Part 2: Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Formula: E = gamma * m * c^2\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n# Energy of Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1/c)**2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * (c**2)\n\n# Energy of Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2/c)**2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * (c**2)\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\nprint(f\"Total energy in terms of mc^2: {E_total/(m*c**2):.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOur calculations show:\n*   **Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total energy (E_total) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
