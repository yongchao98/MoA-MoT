    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue about Gas W:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine potential simple molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ⁴He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes, but unlikely product of a violent chemical reaction).\n        *   D₂O (heavy water vapor): 10 protons (2 from D, 8 from O), 10 neutrons (2 from D, 8 from O-16). (Yes).\n        *   The release of a hydrogen-like gas (D₂) is a very common pattern in reactions of active hydrides/deuterides.\n\n    *   **Clue about Substance B:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is extremely close to 277 K. This is a strong indicator that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Precipitate G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\".\n        *   The thermal decomposition of a substance to yield water (or in this case, heavy water) is characteristic of a hydroxide (or deuteroxide). For example, heating a metal hydroxide M(OH)ₓ produces the metal oxide and water.\n        *   Therefore, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating: `M(OD)x -> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B)`.\n        *   Since G is a precipitate, the metal deuteroxide must be insoluble. This rules out alkali metals like Na, K, and Li, as their hydroxides are very soluble. It suggests metals like Mg, Ca, Al, etc.\n\n    *   **Clue about the Reaction:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G\".\n        *   We have G = M(OD)ₓ. This deuteroxide is formed in the reaction. This implies that the solvent, Y, must be the source of the OD groups, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction is: `X + D₂O (Y) -> W (gas) + M(OD)x (G, precipitate)`.\n        *   If X were a simple metal, the gas released would be D₂. For example: `Ca + 2 D₂O -> Ca(OD)₂ + D₂`. This is a plausible path.\n        *   However, we have stronger clues pointing to another identity for X.\n\n    *   **Clues about Substance X:**\n        *   \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\": This is consistent with containing Deuterium (D).\n        *   \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\": This points towards a common reagent.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\": A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A product with 2 oxygen atoms suggests a reduction reaction that converts the keto acid to a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This requires a powerful reducing agent, much stronger than a simple metal like Ca.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Propose the Identity of X**\n\n    *   A very common, powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n        *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4 D₂ (gas)`\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas is D₂. As determined earlier, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The precipitate is Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a known gelatinous precipitate, so this fits.\n        *   **Heating G to get B:** Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause dehydration: `2 Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. The released substance B is D₂O.\n        *   **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Keto acid reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into a diol, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This fits.\n        *   **Organic reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a cornerstone reagent in organic synthesis. This fits.\n\n    *   All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It clarifies to sum the masses of all atoms of those elements.\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen. In the molecule, it is present as 4 atoms of its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium. In the molecule, it is present as 1 atom of Aluminium (the most common isotope is ²⁷Al).\n    *   We will use the mass numbers for the calculation, as the answer options are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   Calculate the cumulative mass:\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative (summed) mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
