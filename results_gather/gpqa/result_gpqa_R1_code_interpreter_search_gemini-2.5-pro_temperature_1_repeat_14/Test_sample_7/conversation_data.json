As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Single Mutants:**\n    *   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n    *   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means gene G1 contributes to resistance, and its loss causes a 25% drop in effectiveness.\n    *   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of gene G2 completely abolishes resistance. This indicates that G2 plays an essential or critical role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of gene G3 causes a 50% drop in resistance. G3 is more important for resistance than G1, but less critical than G2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Double Mutants and Look for Epistasis:**\n    *   **Epistasis** occurs when the phenotype of one gene mutation masks the phenotype of another gene mutation in a double mutant. The gene whose phenotype is expressed is called \"epistatic\".\n    *   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. The effect of the `g1` mutation is completely masked. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is also the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. The effect of the `g3` mutation is masked. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   **Conclusion from Epistasis:** When one gene is epistatic to others in a pathway, it often means it acts upstream (like a transcription factor regulating the other genes) or is in a separate, absolutely essential parallel pathway. Given the prompt states that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is a transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3**. If G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 are not activated, leading to a total loss of resistance, regardless of whether G1 or G3 are functional or not.\n\n3.  **Analyze the `g1g3` Double Mutant:**\n    *   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   The `g1` mutant loses 25% resistance. The `g3` mutant loses 50% resistance. If the genes acted independently, one might expect the double mutant to lose roughly 75% of its resistance (25% + 50%), resulting in ~25% resistance.\n    *   However, the observed resistance is only 10%, a loss of 90%. This effect is much greater than the sum of the individual effects. This type of genetic interaction is called **synergy** or **synthetic enhancement**.\n    *   **Conclusion from Synergy:** This synergistic effect suggests that G1 and G3 have **redundant or overlapping functions**. They likely represent two parallel branches of the resistance pathway downstream of G2. While losing one branch reduces resistance, the other can partially compensate. Losing both branches almost completely shuts down the pathway, leading to a severe phenotype. So, the statement \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is a very strong conclusion from the data.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** Incorrect. Our analysis shows G2 is the likely transcription factor, not G1.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The claim \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct. \"Pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment which only measures one trait. \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option has two strongly supported conclusions: **\"G2 is a transcription factor\"** and **\"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"**. The third part, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect, as shown above. However, compared to other options, this one contains the most accurate descriptions of the genetic relationships.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is correct. \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\" is a possible mechanism but cannot be concluded from this data. \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nOption C contains two correct and powerful conclusions drawn directly from the data (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). Although it contains an error in its final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"), it represents the best and most comprehensive conclusion among the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
