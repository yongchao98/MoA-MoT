    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. This is a vector relationship.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * k_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for the interaction between the spin and the magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n*   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = - (γS) · (B * k_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down). The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the one with the most negative energy, which is `E_up`. This corresponds to the spin-up state, where the spin angular momentum is aligned with the magnetic field.\n*   So, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard `S_z` basis, this state is represented by the spinor `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field in the Z direction is turned off, and a new field `B_new = B * j_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on. The magnitude `B` is the same.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γS) · (B * j_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian `H_new`, the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * S_y * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\n*   We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n*   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)>`.\n*   This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the +Z axis, will start to precess around the axis of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis). The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB` (or `|γB|` to be precise, but `γ` and `B` are treated as positive magnitudes here).\n*   The expectation value of the spin vector `<s>` precesses around the `B` field. The equation of motion is `d<s>/dt = γ * <s> x B`.\n*   Let's solve for the components: `<s> = (<S_x>, <S_y>, <S_z>)` and `B = (0, B, 0)`.\n    *   `d<S_z>/dt = γ * (<S_x>B_y - <S_y>B_x) = γB<S_x>`\n    *   `d<S_x>/dt = γ * (<S_y>B_z - <S_z>B_y) = -γB<S_z>`\n*   Taking the derivative of the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n*   Substituting the second equation into this:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB<S_z>) = -(γB)²<S_z>`\n*   This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n*   The solution for `<S_z(t)>` will be of the form `A*cos(ωt) + C*sin(ωt)`. Specifically, it is `<S_z(t)> = <S_z(0)> * cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   Therefore, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n*   The expression `cos(γBt)` shows that the value oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is the Larmor frequency, which is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
