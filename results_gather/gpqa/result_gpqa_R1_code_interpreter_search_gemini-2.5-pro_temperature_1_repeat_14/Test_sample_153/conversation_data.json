    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (using the most abundant isotope for each element).\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+2 peak is highly characteristic of the presence of a chlorine or bromine atom.\n    *   Chlorine has two common isotopes: ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance). The ratio of their abundances is approximately 3:1.\n    *   A molecule containing one chlorine atom will show two peaks in the mass spectrum: an M+ peak (containing ³⁵Cl) and an M+2 peak (containing ³⁷Cl). The expected intensity ratio is approximately 100:(24.2/75.8 * 100) ≈ 100:32.\n    *   The observed ratio of 100:32 is a perfect match for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options to confirm they match. All options (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a nominal mass of 156 (for ³⁵Cl).\n    `7*12 (C) + 5*1 (H) + 1*35 (Cl) + 2*16 (O) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156`\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to dimerization through hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This makes options C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates and rules out A (aldehyde/phenol) and B (phenyl chloroformate).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This is a singlet integrating to one proton, located in a very downfield region. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data and eliminates options A and B.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:**\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation of Aromatic Region:** The aromatic region of the spectrum shows a highly symmetrical pattern. The presence of only two signals, both of which are doublets and each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Candidates (C and D):**\n\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. It has no plane of symmetry that simplifies the proton signals. It would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region for the four different aromatic protons, which would be a much more complex pattern than what is observed.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring.\n    *   It has the required carboxylic acid and chlorine atom.\n    *   Its molecular weight is 156.\n    *   It possesses the necessary symmetry to produce two doublets in the ¹H NMR spectrum, each integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -Cl group are less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure. The mass spectrum indicates a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the ¹H NMR definitively shows a para-substitution pattern. Therefore, the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
