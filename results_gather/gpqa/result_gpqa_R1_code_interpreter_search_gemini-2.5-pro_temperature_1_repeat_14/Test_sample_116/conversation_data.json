    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation around a bond). A molecule is achiral if it possesses an element of symmetry such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   The positions ortho to this connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   These bulky groups cause steric hindrance, which severely restricts the free rotation of the phenyl rings around the central C-C single bond.\n    *   This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar, and the molecule adopts a stable, twisted conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on the rings prevents the molecule from having a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, the molecule is chiral. This specific type of stereoisomerism arising from hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The chemical structure can be written as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a **chiral center** or an asymmetric carbon atom.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism, existing as (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized as it is part of a C=O double bond. It is bonded to only three groups (two carbons and one oxygen), so it cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group due to steric hindrance, creating a \"propeller\" shape that is technically chiral in a fixed state, the energy barrier for rotation around the carbon-phenyl single bonds is very low.\n    *   This means that the two enantiomeric conformations interconvert rapidly at room temperature. Because the enantiomers cannot be isolated, the compound is considered effectively achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. The molecule has a C2 symmetry axis and is overall achiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to the C=C double bond, the core of the molecule is planar.\n    *   This planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nThus, the correct option is D, which includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
