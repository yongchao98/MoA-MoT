    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the major isomer of the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Reaction of Cyclooctatetraene with Maleic Anhydride**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and maleic anhydride.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n3.  **Mechanism:** Cyclooctatetraene exists in a non-planar \"tub\" conformation and is not reactive as a diene. Upon heating, it establishes an equilibrium with its valence isomer, **bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene**. This isomer contains a reactive 1,3-cyclohexadiene system.\n4.  **Diels-Alder Reaction:** Bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene acts as the diene and maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile. The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction is critical. For a bicyclic diene like this, the dienophile can approach from two faces:\n    *   ***syn*** **-attack:** Approach from the same face as the four-membered ring bridge. This pathway is sterically hindered.\n    *   ***exo*** **-attack:** Approach from the face opposite to the four-membered ring bridge. This pathway is sterically favored.\n    The reaction proceeds via the kinetically and thermodynamically favored ***exo*** **-attack**.\n6.  **Product 1:** The major product is the *exo*-adduct, which is *exo*-tricyclo[4.2.2.0²,⁵]deca-3,9-diene-7,8-dicarboxylic anhydride. In this molecule, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the cyclobutene ring (the C9-C10 double bond). The *cis* stereochemistry of the maleic anhydride is preserved in the anhydride ring of the product.\n\n### **Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with Methanol and Sulfuric Acid**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** Product 1 and methanol (CH₃OH), with an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** Acid-catalyzed alcoholysis (esterification) of the anhydride.\n3.  **Mechanism:** The anhydride ring is opened by nucleophilic attack from methanol, forming two methyl ester groups. The reaction proceeds with retention of stereochemistry.\n4.  **Product 2:** The product is the dimethyl ester corresponding to Product 1. It is **dimethyl *exo*-tricyclo[4.2.2.0²,⁵]deca-3,9-diene-7,8-dicarboxylate**. The two methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃) are *cis* to each other and maintain the *exo* orientation, pointing away from the cyclobutene ring.\n\n### **Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with Cyclopentadiene**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** Product 2 and cyclopentadiene.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** A second Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n3.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The double bond of the cyclobutene ring (C9=C10) in Product 2. This double bond is strained and thus highly reactive.\n    *   **Diene:** Cyclopentadiene.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of this addition is determined by steric hindrance. The dienophile is part of a large, bulky, cage-like molecule. The cyclopentadiene must approach the cyclobutene double bond from the sterically most accessible face.\n    *   ***syn*** **-attack:** Approach from the same side as the bulky tricyclic framework. This is highly hindered.\n    *   ***anti*** **-attack:** Approach from the face away from the bulky framework. This is the least hindered and therefore the strongly preferred pathway.\n5.  **Product 3:** The major isomer is the one resulting from this ***anti*** **-addition**. This means the new methylene bridge (-CH₂-) from the cyclopentadiene is oriented away from the original cage structure.\n\n### **Summary of Stereochemistry of the Major Isomer (Product 3)**\n\nThe major isomer is the **(exo, anti)-diastereomer**. It is formed through:\n1.  ***Exo*** addition of maleic anhydride in the first Diels-Alder reaction.\n2.  ***Anti*** addition of cyclopentadiene in the second Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Options**\n\nThe options provided are four different stereoisomers. We must identify the one that corresponds to the (exo, anti) structure.\n\n1.  **Option B** can be eliminated first. The name specifies (10R, 11R) for the dicarboxylate centers. An R,R or S,S configuration implies a *trans* relationship between the substituents. Since the reaction uses maleic anhydride (a *cis*-dienophile), the resulting ester groups must be *cis* (having an R,S or S,R configuration). Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Options A, C, and D** all have a (10S, 11R) configuration for the ester groups, which is a *cis* relationship. These represent three different diastereomers of the final product. These diastereomers differ in the stereochemical outcomes of the two Diels-Alder reactions (*exo* vs. *endo* for the first, *syn* vs. *anti* for the second).\n\n3.  As established, the major product results from the combination of the most favorable pathway for each step: **exo** addition followed by **anti** addition. We need to identify which option represents this specific (exo, anti) diastereomer.\n\n    *   Comparing the structures based on their IUPAC names reveals that they represent different relative orientations of the molecular fragments. For example, comparing isomer A and C shows they differ in the relative orientation of the cyclopentadiene-derived part (controlled by *syn*/*anti* addition). Comparing isomer A and D shows differences that would arise from the initial *exo*/*endo* choice.\n\n    *   The (exo, anti) product is the one where all bulky groups are positioned to minimize steric interactions. This is the most stable and kinetically preferred product. Without complex 3D modeling, we rely on identifying the structure that represents this outcome. Chemical literature and standard representations of such domino Diels-Alder products consistently show a specific stereochemical arrangement corresponding to the (exo, anti) adduct.\n\n4.  **Option A** corresponds to the structure of this predicted major (exo, anti) isomer. The stereochemical descriptors in the name define the specific arrangement resulting from the two highly stereoselective Diels-Alder reactions. The other options, C and D, represent less stable diastereomers (e.g., an *exo, syn* or *endo, anti* product) which would be formed as minor products, if at all.\n\nTherefore, the structure provided in option A is the major isomer of product 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
