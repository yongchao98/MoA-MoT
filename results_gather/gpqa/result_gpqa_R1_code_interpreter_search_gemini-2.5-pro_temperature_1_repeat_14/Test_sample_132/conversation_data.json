    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation to determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-.\n\n**1. Understand the chemical species in the solution:**\n*   KH2PO4 dissolves to give K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate) ions.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolves to give 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n*   The key species for the pH calculation are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). This means the solution is a buffer.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\nFirst, we need to find the moles of each salt added to the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n\nNext, we calculate the initial concentrations:\n*   [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] of the buffer:**\nThe buffer system is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nThe expression for Ka2 is:\nKa2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n\nUsing the initial concentrations as a good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations:\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * 1.308\n[H⁺] = 8.110x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4³⁻]:**\nThe formation of orthophosphate ions is governed by the third dissociation equilibrium:\nHPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is:\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n[PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have calculated. We use the initial concentration of HPO4²⁻ as its equilibrium concentration is not significantly changed by this very small dissociation.\n[PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.110x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO4³⁻] = 6.236x10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# 1. Moles\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# 2. Concentrations\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume\n\n# 3. [H+]\nh_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# 4. [PO4^3-]\nconc_po4_3 = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / h_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3:.3e}\")\n```\n> 6.236e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236x10⁻⁷ M. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The solution contains a mixture of H2PO4⁻ (from KH2PO4) and HPO4²⁻ (from Na2HPO4●2H2O), which constitutes a buffer system.\n\n1.  **Calculate the molarity of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4⁻ = [H2PO4⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4²⁻ = [HPO4²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**:\n    The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which governs the buffer:\n    H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\n    Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is not necessary, we can directly use the Ka expression:\n    Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4³⁻] concentration**:\n    The concentration of the orthophosphate ion is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n    The expression for Ka3 is:\n    Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    Rearranging to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n    [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    Now, we plug in the calculated values. We can assume the equilibrium concentration of [HPO4²⁻] is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because Ka3 is very small, meaning very little HPO4²⁻ will dissociate.\n    [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.236x10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding the result to two decimal places gives 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. This matches the result from the code and corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
