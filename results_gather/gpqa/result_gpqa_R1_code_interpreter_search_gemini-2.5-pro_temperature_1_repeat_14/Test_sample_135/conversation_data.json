    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `f(r)`. The integral is `∫_V (∇.f) dV`.\n    *   The vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and is directed radially outward from the origin. In vector notation using spherical coordinates, this is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Method:** We could try to calculate the divergence `∇.f` directly and then integrate it over the volume. However, the field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume of integration. Calculating the divergence at this singularity can be tricky (it involves the Dirac delta function). A much more straightforward approach is to use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:** The Divergence Theorem relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field itself. The theorem states:\n    `∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮∮_S (f . dS)`\n    *   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`, which is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Set up the Surface Integral:** We need to evaluate the right-hand side of the theorem, `∮∮_S (f . dS)`.\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface (S):** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to the radius `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` in spherical coordinates points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. As a vector, it is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Dot Product (f . dS):** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n        `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] . [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n        The `R^2` terms cancel out. The dot product of the unit vector `r_hat` with itself is `r_hat . r_hat = 1`.\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r_hat . r_hat)`\n        `f . dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The integration limits for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮∮_S (f . dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) [∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ] dφ`\n\n    *   **Inner Integral (with respect to θ):**\n        `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` evaluated from `0` to `π`\n        `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))`\n        `= -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   **Outer Integral (with respect to φ):**\n        `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]` evaluated from `0` to `2π`\n        `= 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 0\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
