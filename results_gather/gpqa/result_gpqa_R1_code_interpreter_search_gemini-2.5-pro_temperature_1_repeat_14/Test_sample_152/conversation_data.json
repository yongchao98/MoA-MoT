    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   The Michael donor is the nucleophile. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂) are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. Thus, dimethyl malonate will be deprotonated to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, which serves as the Michael donor.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-COOCH₃`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate formation):** `NaOEt + CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ → ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2 (Nucleophilic attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The double bond electrons shift to the α-carbon, and the carbonyl electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n        `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + (p-tolyl)-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → (p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final neutral product (A).\n        `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify Product (A):**\n    *   The structure of product (A) is `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC rules, we identify the parent acid. The structure can be seen as a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH(COOH)₂`) that is substituted with a p-tolyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   This reaction is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n    *   The Michael donor is the enamine, **1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine**, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral but highly nucleophilic at their α-carbon.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** (crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic attack):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone ring and producing a protonated piperidine salt.\n\n3.  **Identify Product (B):**\n    *   The net result is the formation of a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) and the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   The fragment from butenenitrile that gets attached to the ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   This group is attached to the α-carbon (C2) of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product (B) is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one`.\n    *   To name this compound, we treat the nitrile as the principal functional group. The parent chain is butanenitrile. The (2-oxocyclohexyl) group is a substituent at the C3 position of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product, not the enol tautomer.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a retrosynthesis problem where we need to find the starting material C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** C.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Reverse the Reaction:**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify this bond in the product. The substituent `-(3-oxobutyl)` has the structure `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This group comes from MVK (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`). The bond is formed to the β-carbon.\n    *   The donor's nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This carbon is highly acidic as it is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making it an excellent Michael donor precursor.\n    *   To find reactant C, we mentally break the bond between the C2 of the ring and the `CH₂` of the side chain.\n    *   This disconnection gives us the acceptor (MVK) and the enolate of the donor C.\n    *   Protonating this enolate gives the neutral starting material C.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant (C):**\n    *   The enolate is the anion of cyclohexane-1,3-dione at the C2 position.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
