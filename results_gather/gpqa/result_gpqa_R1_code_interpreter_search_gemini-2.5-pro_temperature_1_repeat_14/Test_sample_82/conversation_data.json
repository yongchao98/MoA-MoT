    "This problem involves a two-step calculation for a titration process. First, we need to account for the initial dilution of the acetic acid. Second, we need to calculate the pH at two specific points during the titration with NaOH: at 25% of the way to the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume of the diluted acid (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n\nWe use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration of acetic acid (M2) that will be titrated.\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (a weak acid, HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the strong base NaOH. This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   **pKa:** The pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant, Ka.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   **Ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is now the conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid. So, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow we can calculate the pH.\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (HA) has reacted with the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaA). The solution now contains only the conjugate base (A⁻), which will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution:\n\nA⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (A⁻) at the equivalence point.\n\n*   **Moles of acid:** Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Total volume:** Initial acid volume + NaOH volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   **Concentration of acetate [A⁻]:** [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, we use the hydrolysis reaction to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n\n*   **Kb:** Ka × Kb = Kw (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C)\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   **Equilibrium:** For the reaction A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻, the equilibrium expression is Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻].\n    Letting [OH⁻] = x, we get Kb ≈ x² / [A⁻].\n*   **Solve for x ([OH⁻]):** x = √([A⁻] × Kb)\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:** pOH = -log([OH⁻]), and pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05 # M\ninitial_acid_vol = 0.020 # L\nwater_vol = 0.020 # L\nnaoh_conc = 0.1 # M\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Step 1: Dilution\ndiluted_acid_vol = initial_acid_vol + water_vol\ndiluted_acid_conc = (initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol) / diluted_acid_vol\n\n# Step 2: pH at 25% Titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = diluted_acid_conc * diluted_acid_vol\n\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence point\nvol_naoh_equiv = moles_acid / naoh_conc\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_equiv = diluted_acid_vol + vol_naoh_equiv\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_base_equiv = moles_acid / total_vol_equiv\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_base_equiv)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_equiv = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_equiv = 14.00 - pOH_equiv\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The detailed reasoning is as follows:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   So, we are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base] to [acid] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 4.26.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water.\n\n*   **Moles of acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of base = moles of acid.\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    Using the equilibrium expression Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻], we can approximate [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻]).\n    [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 8.52.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
