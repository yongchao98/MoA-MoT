    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6 base) with two substituents, replacing two hydrogen atoms. The core formula for this part is C6H4. The presence of **two signals for aromatic-H** strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. In a para-disubstituted ring with two different substituents, the chemical environments of the four protons result in two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system).\n\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester functional group, which has the formula -COO-. This adds one carbon and two oxygen atoms to our count.\n\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-).\n    *   One signal is a **doublet**, meaning this proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. This is a key piece of information. \"Doublet\" means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (the other vinyl proton). \"Quartet\" means it's also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This splitting pattern uniquely identifies a **propenyl group**: -CH=CH-CH3. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group gives the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton gives the doublet. This fragment contributes C3H5 to the formula.\n\n*   **-CH3 signals:** The spectrum shows **two signals for -CH3 groups**.\n    *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) group we just identified.\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Given we have an ester group (-COO-), this second methyl group is most likely part of a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). This fragment contributes C1H3.\n\n*   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates any structures containing methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the fragments we've identified:\n*   From the aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   From the ester group's carbonyl: C1O2\n*   From the propenyl group: C3H5\n*   From the second methyl group: C1H3\n\nNow, let's combine these pieces:\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (methyl) = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl) = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2 (ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nA possible structure that fits all the data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This molecule is para-substituted, has an ester, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and no CH2 groups, perfectly matching all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n**3. Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\nLet's calculate the DoU for the deduced formula C11H12O2 and compare it to the structural requirements.\n*   DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n\nLet's check if our proposed structure has a DoU of 6:\n*   Benzene ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n*   Ester C=O double bond: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Vinyl C=C double bond: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\nThe calculated DoU matches the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n**4. Eliminate Other Options**\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 7. This DoU is too high for the identified fragments.\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 5. This DoU would mean there is no vinyl C=C double bond, which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 6. While the DoU is correct, getting from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2 requires adding a CH2 group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, so this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
