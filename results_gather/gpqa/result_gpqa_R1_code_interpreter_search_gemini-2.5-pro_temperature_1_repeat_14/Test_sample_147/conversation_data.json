    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    We are given that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it YF_n) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    where M_F is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the atomic mass of element Y.\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M_Y, we get:\n    M_Y = 19.00 * n * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n    We need to find an integer 'n' (the oxidation state of Y in A2) that results in a realistic atomic mass M_Y for an element that can form five binary fluorides and whose compounds can oxidize xenon.\n\n2.  **Test Potential Elements.**\n    *   If n=6, M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 6 = 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic masses of transuranic elements like Plutonium (Pu, ~244 g/mol) or Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). Let's check Pu. If Y=Pu and n=6, A2 would be PuF6. The theoretical mass % of F in PuF6 is (6*19)/(244+6*19) = 114/358 = 31.84%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%. However, calculating the molecular weights of plutonium fluorides (PuF3: 301, PuF4: 320, PuF5: 339, PuF6: 358 g/mol) shows that none of them fall into the low molecular weight ranges given in the options (A, B, C, D). This rules out Plutonium and other heavy elements.\n    *   If n=3, M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). Let's check the mass % of F in SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol. %F = (3*19)/178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match. Let's keep Sb as a candidate.\n    *   Let's test another candidate from the same region of the periodic table, Iodine (I, M=126.9 g/mol). If Y=I, what would n be? n ≈ M_Y / 40.45 = 126.9 / 40.45 ≈ 3.13. This is very close to n=3. So A2 could be IF3. Let's check the mass % of F in IF3. M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3*19 = 183.9 g/mol. %F = (3*19)/183.9 = 30.99%. This is reasonably close to 31.96% (about 3% relative difference).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates Y=Sb and Y=I using other clues.**\n    The crucial clue is the reaction to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This is a comproportionation reaction where elemental Y reduces A4.\n    *   **If Y=Sb:** A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5. The main fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5. So, A4 must be SbF5 and A5 must be SbF3. The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → SbF3. The balanced reaction is **2** Sb + **3** SbF5 → 5 SbF3. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. This contradicts the problem statement. So, Y is not Sb.\n    *   **If Y=I:** The standard state of iodine is I2. \"Adding Y\" refers to adding I2. The known fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. Let's test the reaction I2 + A4 → A5. The reaction **I2 + IF3 → 3 IF** is a known comproportionation reaction where the molar ratio of reactants (I2:IF3) is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    This implies **A4 = IF3** and **A5 = IF**.\n\n4.  **Verify the remaining clues for Y=I.**\n    *   **A4 = IF3**: \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". IF3 is a yellow solid, which contradicts \"colorless\". This is a noted inconsistency.\n    *   **A5 = IF**: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" IF is known to disproportionate in water: 5 IF + 3 H2O → 2 I2 + HIO3 + 5 HF. This produces two iodine-containing substances (I2 and HIO3). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Let's reconsider the \"colorless\" clue. It's possible the clue is flawed, or refers to something else. Let's check other possibilities for A4. What if A4 = IF5? IF5 is a colorless liquid, which fits the description. The reaction would be I2 + IF5 -> A5 (1:1), where A5 would be a mixed-valence species I3F5. This is plausible. So A4 could be IF5.\n\n5.  **Determine A4 by its Molecular Weight.**\n    We have two main candidates for A4: IF3 and IF5. Let's calculate their molecular weights and check the given options.\n    *   M(IF3) = 126.9 + 3 * 19.0 = 183.9 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the ranges (it's close to range B: 160-180, but outside it).\n    *   M(IF5) = 126.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 221.9 g/mol. This value falls perfectly into range **C) 220-240**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The hypothesis that Y=I and A4=IF5 is the most consistent one. It fits the molecular weight range perfectly, and IF5 is a colorless liquid, matching the description of the solution of A4. While there are inconsistencies in the problem description (the color of A1, the slight inaccuracy of the mass % for A2=IF3), the identification of A4=IF5 is strongly supported by its molecular weight and physical properties.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is ~222 g/mol. This falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>"
