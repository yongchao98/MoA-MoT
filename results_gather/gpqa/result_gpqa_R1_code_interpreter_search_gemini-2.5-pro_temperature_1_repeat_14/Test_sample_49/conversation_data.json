    "An L-loop Feynman diagram in `d`-dimensional spacetime requires the evaluation of `L` independent momentum integrals of the form `∫ d^d k / (2pi)^d`.\n\nThe question specifies that the quantum field theory is on **four-dimensional spacetime**, so `d=4`.\n\nLet's analyze the integration measure for a single loop (`L=1`) in `d=4`.\nThe integral is over `d^4k / (2pi)^4`.\nIn quantum field theory calculations, it is standard practice to perform a Wick rotation to Euclidean spacetime. This changes the momentum-space measure and simplifies the integrals. The result of integrating over the angular components of the four-dimensional Euclidean momentum space gives a factor related to the surface area of a unit 3-sphere, which is `2π^2`.\n\nLet's break down the factor arising from a single loop integral:\n1.  The integration measure is `d^4k / (2pi)^4`.\n2.  After Wick rotation to Euclidean space, the integral over the angular part is performed. The volume element `d^4k_E` can be written as `k_E^3 dk_E dΩ_4`, where `dΩ_4` is the solid angle element. The integral over the solid angle `∫ dΩ_4` yields the surface area of a unit 3-sphere, which is `2π^2`.\n3.  So, the integration measure contains the factor: `(1 / (2π)^4) * 2π^2 = 2π^2 / (16π^4) = 1 / (8π^2)`.\n\nOften, after introducing Feynman parameters to combine the denominators of the propagators, another factor of 2 or other numerical constants might appear. However, a very common and robust convention in the literature, particularly in the context of dimensional regularization (which is a standard method for handling loop divergences), is that each loop contributes a factor of `1 / (16π^2)` to the final expression.\n\nThis conventional loop factor can be written as:\n`1 / (16π^2) = 1 / (4π)^2`\n\nFor a Feynman diagram with `L` loops, there are `L` such independent momentum integrals. Therefore, the total factor from the loop integrations will be:\n`(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\nNow, let's examine the expression from the colleague's note:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nWe can identify the different parts of this expression:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: The coupling constants, related to the number and type of vertices in the diagram.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: Purely numerical factors arising from the specific details of the calculation (e.g., symmetry factors, matrix traces).\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: A kinematic factor, representing a ratio of energy scales squared. This is typical in results of loop calculations where there are different mass scales.\n*   `1/(4pi)^6`: This term has the characteristic form of the loop integration factor.\n\nBy comparing the general form of the loop factor with the one in the expression, we can determine the number of loops, `L`.\nGeneral form: `1 / (4π)^(2L)`\nExpression's factor: `1 / (4π)^6`\n\nEquating the two:\n`1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n\nThis implies that the exponents must be equal:\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`:\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
