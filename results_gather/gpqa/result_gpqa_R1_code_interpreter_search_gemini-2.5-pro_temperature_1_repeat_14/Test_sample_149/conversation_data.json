    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO) from NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows:\n    *   DU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    *   A DU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Interpretation:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). The chemical shift suggests it's also attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like the benzene ring. So we have a `-CH2-CHO` (phenylacetaldehyde) fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. Its broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Putting it all together, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   These reagents are used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The amino group (-NH2) on the 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium chloride group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming the mixture causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation.\n    *   The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group between the ring and the aldehyde). It can therefore act as both the nucleophile (after deprotonation to form an enolate) and the electrophile. This will result in a self-aldol condensation.\n\n**3. Mechanism of the Aldol Condensation**\n\n*   **a) Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH-  ⇌  [HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO] + H2O`\n\n*   **b) Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    `[Enolate] + HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO  →  Alkoxide intermediate`\n\n*   **c) Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.\n    `Aldol Addition Product: HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n    The systematic name of this product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **d) Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**, which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The acidic proton on C2 (alpha to the carbonyl) and the hydroxyl group on C3 are eliminated.\n    `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO  --Heat-->  HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO + H2O`\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:** The final product is `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`. Let's name this compound:\n    *   The main chain contains the aldehyde and the double bond. It is four carbons long: `C4-C3=C2-C1`.\n    *   The parent name is **but-2-enal**.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on carbon 2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on carbon 4.\n    *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name matches option (A). Because the reaction is heated, the condensation (dehydration) product is expected to be the final major product, not the initial addition product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
