    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** I need to analyze each piece of information provided and translate it into a structural feature of the unknown molecule.\n\n    *   **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:** This technique identifies functional groups.\n        *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for an O-H stretch. The \"very broad\" description strongly suggests the O-H is involved in hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. An alcohol O-H is also in this region but is typically less broad than a carboxylic acid O-H.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O group in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n        *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating an alkene.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:** This technique gives information about the hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule.\n        *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** This technique provides the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the molecule and its fragments.\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. I need to determine what common chemical fragment has this mass. Let's calculate the mass of some simple fragments using integer masses (C=12, H=1, O=16):\n            *   Fragment: `CH3O` -> Mass: 12 + (3 * 1) + 16 = 31\n            *   Fragment: `C2H5O` -> Mass: (2 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 16 = 24 + 5 + 16 = 45\n            *   Fragment: `COOH` -> Mass: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45\n        *   The fragment `[COOH]+` is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids in mass spectrometry. The fragment `[C2H5O]+` (an ethoxy group) is also possible but less likely given the overwhelming evidence for a carboxylic acid from the FTIR. The m/z = 45 peak strongly corroborates the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings into a Molecular Structure:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, I have strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH) group**.\n    *   From FTIR and ¹H NMR, I have definitive evidence for an **alkene (C=C) group**.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:** Now, I'll check which of the given formulas matches the required structural features. The key is to use the concept of **Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)**, also known as Double Bond Equivalents. Each double bond and each ring in a molecule corresponds to one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, so it contributes **1 DBE**.\n    *   An alkene group (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, so it contributes **1 DBE**.\n    *   Since my molecule has both, it must have a total of at least **2 DBEs**.\n\n    Let's calculate the DBE for each formula using the rule: **DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)** (for formulas with C, H, and O).\n\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula can represent a carboxylic acid *or* an alkene, but not both. It is inconsistent with my findings.\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula perfectly matches the requirement for two degrees of unsaturation (one for C=O and one for C=C). It also has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **C) C6H12O:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only has one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **D) C6H10O:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has the correct DBE but only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It accounts for the two oxygen atoms of a carboxylic acid and has the two degrees of unsaturation required for a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE) for a chemical formula of the form CxHyOz.\ndef calculate_dbe(C, H):\n    \"\"\"Calculates DBE using the formula: C - H/2 + 1\"\"\"\n    return C - (H / 2) + 1\n\n# Calculate DBE for the given options.\n# A) C6H12O2\ndbe_A = calculate_dbe(C=6, H=12)\n# B) C6H10O2\ndbe_B = calculate_dbe(C=6, H=10)\n# C) C6H12O\ndbe_C = calculate_dbe(C=6, H=12)\n# D) C6H10O\ndbe_D = calculate_dbe(C=6, H=10)\n\n# Calculate the mass of the characteristic fragment COOH.\n# Using integer masses: C=12, O=16, H=1\nmass_COOH = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1\n\nprint(\"--- Analysis Summary ---\")\nprint(\"Required features: Carboxylic acid (2 Oxygens, 1 DBE) and Alkene (1 DBE).\")\nprint(\"Total required DBE = 2.\")\nprint(f\"Mass of characteristic [COOH]+ fragment: {mass_COOH}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Evaluating Options ---\")\nprint(f\"A) C6H12O2: DBE = {dbe_A}.

    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H stretch also appears in this region, but it's typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is the characteristic region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to **vinyl-hydrogens** (protons attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. This supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is observed. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid functional group, -COOH:\n        *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The fragment `[COOH]+` has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, providing strong evidence for this functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined data, we know the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (it has an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   We now need to decide between A (C₆H₁₂O₂) and B (C₆H₁₀O₂). We can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)** to do this. The DBE indicates the total number of rings and/or double bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for molecules containing C, H, and O).\n    *   Our molecule has a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DBE = 2)**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DBE value only accounts for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid but not the required C=C double bond.\n        *   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DBE value perfectly accounts for both the C=O double bond and the C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemical formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is the only one that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation for the required C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
