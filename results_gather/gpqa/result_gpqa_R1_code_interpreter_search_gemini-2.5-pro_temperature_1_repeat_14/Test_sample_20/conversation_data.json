    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, a key requirement is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon must typically be *sp3*-hybridized.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n        *   This molecule is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   These carbons are CH₂ groups, meaning they are *sp3*-hybridized and each possesses two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Because it has alpha-hydrogens, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It readily converts to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic and therefore very stable.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone)**:\n        *   This molecule is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). They are *sp2*-hybridized.\n        *   There are no *sp3*-hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary structural feature to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n\n    *   The question asks for the compound that **does not** show tautomerism. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n        *   **Conclusion**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   The structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion.\n        *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral. It also lacks any chiral centers (a carbon with four different substituents).\n        *   **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and *will not* show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   The question asks for the compound that **will show** optical isomerism. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**:\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
