    "Here's a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change for the reaction where one mole of the compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe formation reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction using the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization via a Hess's Law cycle. The formula is:\nΔHf° = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the molecule to find its molecular formula and the number of each type of bond.\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (in C=) + 1 (in =CH-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in -CH<) + 1 (in CH3) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in =CH-) + 1 (in =C<) + 2 (in (CH3)2). Let's trace it properly.\n        *   (CH3)2**C**= : 3 carbons\n        *   =**C**H- : 1 carbon\n        *   -**C**H2- : 1 carbon\n        *   -**C**H(CH3)- : 2 carbons\n        *   -**C**H2- : 1 carbon\n        *   -**C**H= : 1 carbon\n        *   =**C**(CH3)2 : 3 carbons\n        *   Total Carbons = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   Molecular Formula: **C12H22**\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=CH**- and -CH**=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We can find the number of C-C single bonds. For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds is (Total number of atoms) - 1.\n        *   Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34.\n        *   Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33.\n        *   Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C-H bonds) - (Number of C=C bonds)\n        *   Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe reactants are 12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g). We need to find the energy required to convert them into 12 moles of C(g) atoms and 22 moles of H(g) atoms.\n\n*   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous product, C12H22.\n\n*   Energy for C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy for C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy for C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Total bond energy of the product = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nNow, we apply the main formula.\n\n*   ΔHf° = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to the Units in the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Option D is 1900 kJ/g, which has the correct number but the wrong unit. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g and check against option C.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   M(C12H22) = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C (11.44 kJ/g).\n\nI will verify the calculation using a python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400         # kJ/mol\n\n# Number of atoms and bonds in C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_C_double_bonds = 2\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of reactants: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nenthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + ((num_H / 2) * bond_energy_H_H)\n\n# Total bond energy of product: C12H22(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_C_H_bonds * bond_energy_C_H) + \\\n                             (num_C_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                             (num_C_C_double_bonds * bond_energy_C_C_double)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol)\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (g/mol)\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g)\nenthalpy_of_formation_gram = enthalpy_of_formation_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_of_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_of_formation_gram}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n<<<C>>>",
    "The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.
