    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (mass of H in molecule) / (total molar mass of molecule)`.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The molar mass is approximately `12n + m`. The mass of hydrogen is `m`.\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) â‰ˆ 0.1428`.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is equal to `0.142857...`, which is a very close match.\n*   Let's test this: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`\n*   So, the general formula for substance Z is CnH2n. This formula corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkene and must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's check if n=6 fits. If n=6, m=2*6=12. The formula is C6H12. This is cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton of All Compounds**\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all components in both mixtures X and Y are based on a six-carbon ring skeleton. Any other skeleton (like methylcyclopentane or linear hexanes) would not hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   One of the components is substance Z, which we identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by a \"disproportionation\" reaction on a platinum catalyst when heated. Platinum is a classic catalyst for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n*   Since one component of Y is cyclohexane (the fully hydrogenated C6 ring), the other component must be the product of dehydrogenation. The ultimate, stable product of dehydrogenating a C6 ring is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if benzene fits the description. It is a liquid. It is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. It has a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Components of Mixture X**\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C) and cyclohexane (D).\n*   Since the starting mixture (X) and the final mixture (Y) are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1.\n    *   `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D`\n    *   `A + B --> C6H6 + C6H12`\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X (e.g., A) is dehydrogenated to form benzene, while the other component (B) is hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n*   The law of conservation of mass must apply. Specifically, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the left side of the equation must equal the total number on the right side.\n*   Number of H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of benzene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane)\n    *   = 6 + 12\n    *   = 18\n*   Therefore, the number of H atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\n*   Number of H atoms in reactants = (H atoms in one molecule of A) + (H atoms in one molecule of B) = 18.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids.\n*   Based on our analysis, this sum is 18.\n\n*For completeness, let's propose the identities of A and B:*\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   A plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Sum of H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are alkenes and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated (unlike its 1,3-isomer).\n    *   In the reaction, the diene (C6H8) can be dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), releasing 2 H atoms. The alkene (C6H10) can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12), consuming 2 H atoms. The hydrogen transfer is balanced. This is a consistent solution.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
