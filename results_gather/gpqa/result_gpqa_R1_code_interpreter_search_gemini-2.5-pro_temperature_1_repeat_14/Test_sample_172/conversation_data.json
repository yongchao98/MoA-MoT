    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle**: The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given an uncertainty in position (Δx). This points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum along the same direction (Δpₓ). The mathematical relationship for the minimum uncertainty is:\n    Δx * Δpₓ ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    To find the *minimum* uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality:\n    Δpₓ = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n3.  **Relate Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp) to Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**: The relationship between a particle's energy (E) and its momentum (p) is given by dE/dp. For a particle with velocity v, this relationship is dE/dp = v. Therefore, for small uncertainties, we can write:\n    ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δpₓ\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δpₓ\n    This relation holds for both classical and relativistic mechanics. The velocity `v` is the group velocity of the electron's wave packet.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations**: We can substitute the expression for Δpₓ from step 2 into the equation from step 3 to find a direct relationship between ΔE and Δx:\n    ΔE_min = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\n5.  **Plug in the Given Values**:\n    *   Velocity of the electron, v = 2 * 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result**: Now, we perform the calculation to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE_min).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I will use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nv = 2e8  # speed of electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # uncertainty in position in m\nhbar = 1.05457e-34  # reduced Planck constant in J·s\n\n# Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for minimum uncertainty in momentum\n# delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Relation between uncertainty in energy and uncertainty in momentum\n# delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.055e-16\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation yields a value of approximately 1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**:\n    *   A) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    *   B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n    *   C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    *   D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value of 1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J is best approximated by 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user is asking for the solution to the problem based on the provided information and the calculation.\n\n**1. Recap the Reasoning:**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: The relationship between the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δpₓ) is given by Δx * Δpₓ = ħ / 2.\n*   **Relationship between Energy and Momentum Uncertainty**: The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δpₓ) by the particle's velocity (v): ΔE ≈ v * Δpₓ.\n*   **Combined Formula**: Combining these two principles, we get the formula for the minimum uncertainty in energy: ΔE_min = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx)).\n\n**2. Review the Calculation:**\n*   The Python code executed the following calculation:\n    *   `v = 2e8` m/s\n    *   `delta_x = 0.1e-9` m\n    *   `hbar = 1.05457e-34` J·s\n    *   `delta_E = v * (hbar / (2 * delta_x))`\n*   The output was `1.055e-16`, which is 1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n**3. Match the Result to the Options:**\n*   The calculated value is ΔE ≈ 1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n*   Let's compare this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    *   B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n    *   C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    *   D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   The calculated value is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
