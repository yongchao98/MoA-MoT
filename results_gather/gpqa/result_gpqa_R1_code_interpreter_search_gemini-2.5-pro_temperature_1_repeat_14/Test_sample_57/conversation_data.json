    "One of the central goals of theoretical physics is to formulate a consistent description of nature at all energy scales. In quantum field theory (QFT), which describes the interactions of elementary particles, calculations of physical quantities often lead to infinite results. These infinities arise from loops in Feynman diagrams, which correspond to virtual particles with arbitrarily high energies (or, equivalently, interactions at arbitrarily short distances). This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence.\n\nThe procedure to handle these infinities is called **renormalization**. It involves a two-step process:\n1.  **Regularization**: Temporarily modifying the theory to make the divergent integrals finite. This is done by introducing a parameter called a \"regulator\" or \"cutoff,\" which effectively limits the maximum energy of virtual particles.\n2.  **Renormalization**: Absorbing the infinities into a redefinition of the fundamental parameters of the theory (like mass and charge), which are not directly observable. The redefined parameters are set to match their experimentally measured values.\n\nLet's analyze the given options in this context:\n\nA) **Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory runs into a divergence problem with the concept of a point-like electron. The self-energy of the electric field generated by a point charge is infinite. This indicates a breakdown of the classical theory at very short distances (high energies) and suggests that a point-like charge is an oversimplification. This problem is a classical analogue of a UV divergence and implies the need for a modification, or \"regularization,\" of the theory at short distances.\n\nB) **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It is a renormalizable quantum field theory. Perturbative calculations in QED are plagued by UV divergences, and the machinery of regularization and renormalization is essential to extract finite, meaningful physical predictions. Without it, the theory would predict infinite values for quantities like the electron's mass and charge.\n\nD) **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: This is the quantum theory of the strong force. Like QED, it is a renormalizable quantum field theory. It also requires regularization and renormalization to handle the UV divergences that appear in calculations involving loops of quarks and gluons.\n\nC) **Superstring Theory**: This is a candidate for a unified theory of everything, including quantum gravity. One of its most celebrated features is that it is believed to be free from ultraviolet divergences. The fundamental objects in string theory are not point-like particles but one-dimensional, vibrating strings. The interactions between these strings are not localized at a single point in spacetime but are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effect, a direct consequence of the strings' extended nature, naturally tames the high-energy behavior of loop diagrams, effectively acting as a built-in, physical regulator. As a result, scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are expected to be finite without the need for the *ad hoc* process of regularization and renormalization required in point-particle quantum field theories.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the framework that is believed not to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<C>>>"
