    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. A ketone (butan-2-one) reacts to form a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n        1.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from the dissociation of NaCN, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n        2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable cyanohydrin product with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n            `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the second step. Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `NaHSO3`: Sodium bisulfite is used for forming bisulfite addition products with carbonyls, not for cyanohydrin formation. This is incorrect.\n        *   `H3O⁺`: The hydronium ion is the chemical representation for a strong acid in an aqueous solution. It is an excellent source of protons. This is a suitable reagent for the protonation step.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile requires water and is catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The overall reaction is:\n        `R-C≡N + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃`\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis in the presence of water (H₂O). We need to choose between the remaining options for B:\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH3COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. Nitrile hydrolysis is a difficult reaction that requires harsh conditions (strong acid or strong base). A weak acid like acetic acid is generally not effective enough to catalyze this reaction to completion.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid catalyst, making HCl the correct choice.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
