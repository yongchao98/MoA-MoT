    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. It involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate in this case) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the ketone that will be deprotonated to form the enolate nucleophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base, perfect for forming enolates.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n3.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic proton from a carbon atom alpha (α) to the carbonyl group (C=O) of the ketone.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1 (the carbonyl carbon), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, C1, and C5. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-proton, the base must deprotonate this position. This forms the C6-enolate, where C6 becomes the nucleophilic center.\n\n4.  **Nucleophilic attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The C6-enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n        *   Ethyl acrylate: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt\n    *   A new carbon-carbon single bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n5.  **Structure of the product A:**\n    *   The initial ketone ring now has a new substituent at the C6 position: `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents:\n        *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n        *   C2: An ethyl group and a methyl group\n        *   C6: A methyl group and a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group\n\n6.  **Naming the product A:**\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the ester is the highest priority functional group, so the parent name is derived from the ester part: **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain, attached at carbon 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment as C1'. The principal functional group on the ring (the ketone) should receive the lowest possible number. Numbering from the attachment point towards the carbonyl group makes the carbonyl C2'.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   An oxo group at C2' (the original ketone).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3' (the original C2 substituents).\n    *   Therefore, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The nucleophile is a carbanion derived from a nitroalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Proton source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n3.  **Formation of the carbanion (nitronate):**\n    *   The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group (-NO₂) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon (C1) of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate ion): `CH₃-CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂`.\n\n4.  **Nucleophilic attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n        *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile: CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the butenenitrile.\n\n5.  **Structure of the product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure after attack and protonation by water is: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Naming the product B:**\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group. The carbon chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group has 6 carbons. Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group at C3.\n        *   A nitro group at C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. This matches the name provided in options C and D.\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. This matches the name provided in options B and D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
