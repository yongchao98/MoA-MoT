    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   A charge of $-q$ will be attracted to the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If we imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the material of the conductor, enclosing the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the charge on the inner surface must be $-q$ to cancel the $+q$ charge placed inside the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must be left on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality ($Q_{total} = Q_{inner} + Q_{outer} = -q + (+q) = 0$).\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding.\n    *   The charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall) produce an electric field within the cavity, but their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity, including inside the conducting material and outside the conductor.\n    *   Similarly, the charge on the outer surface produces a field outside the conductor, but it does not produce any field inside the conductor or within the cavity.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined *solely* by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. The configuration of charges inside the cavity is completely shielded and has no effect on the external field.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge on the outer surface is $+q$. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges or fields mentioned, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical surface of radius $R$.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   This charge can be treated as a point charge located at the center of the main spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The final expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the charge $q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from P to the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ is irrelevant for calculating the field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
