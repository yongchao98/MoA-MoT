    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe decay of the stationary pion Pi(+) into a muon mu(+) and a neutrino (nu) must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n*   **Initial State:** The pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n    *   Initial momentum (p_initial) = 0\n    *   Initial kinetic energy = 0\n    *   Initial total energy (E_initial) = Rest mass energy of Pi(+) = M_pi * c^2\n*   **Final State:** The products are a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   They move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n    *   |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p (where p is the magnitude of the momentum)\n    *   Final total energy (E_final) = E_mu + E_nu\n\n**2. List the Given Values**\n\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), M_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), M_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (nu) is assumed to be massless, so its rest mass M_nu * c^2 = 0. For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (E_nu = KE_nu) and is related to its momentum by E_nu = p * c.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    M_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n    139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu  ---(Equation 1)\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    p_initial = p_final\n    0 = p_mu + p_nu\n    This implies the momentum vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n    p_mu = -p_nu\n    |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) for any particle is given by:\nE^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2  ---(Equation 2)\n\n*   For the neutrino (nu), since M_nu = 0:\n    E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0\n    E_nu = p*c  ---(Equation 3)\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations. Let's solve for the energies of the product particles.\n\nFrom Equations 2 and 3, we can equate (p*c)^2:\nE_mu^2 - (M_mu * c^2)^2 = E_nu^2\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can express E_nu in terms of E_mu:\nE_nu = M_pi * c^2 - E_mu\n\nNow substitute this expression for E_nu into the equation above:\nE_mu^2 - (M_mu * c^2)^2 = (M_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2\n\nExpand the right side of the equation:\nE_mu^2 - (M_mu * c^2)^2 = (M_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (M_pi * c^2) * E_mu + E_mu^2\n\nCancel the E_mu^2 term from both sides:\n-(M_mu * c^2)^2 = (M_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (M_pi * c^2) * E_mu\n\nRearrange to solve for the total energy of the muon (E_mu):\n2 * (M_pi * c^2) * E_mu = (M_pi * c^2)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2\nE_mu = [ (M_pi * c^2)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (M_pi * c^2) ]\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nNow, plug in the given rest mass energies to find E_mu.\n\n```python\n# Define the rest mass energies in MeV\nM_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi(+)\nM_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu(+)\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (M_pi_c2**2 + M_mu_c2**2) / (2 * M_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE = Total Energy - Rest Mass Energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - M_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu) using energy conservation\n# E_nu = E_pi - E_mu\nE_nu = M_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy is its total energy\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+) = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu = {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nKE of mu(+) = 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu = 29.78 MeV\n>>>\nThe calculations show:\n*   The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is **4.12 MeV**.\n*   The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is **29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n*   Initial total energy (E_initial) = Rest mass energy of the pion = `M_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`.\n*   Initial momentum (p_initial) = 0.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The products are a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n*   To conserve momentum, they must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum be `p`.\n*   `p_mu = -p_nu`, so `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n*   Final total energy (E_final) is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n\n**3. Conservation Laws:**\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `E_initial = E_final`\n    `M_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n    `139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu`  (Equation 1)\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n    *   For the muon (mu+), with rest mass `M_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`:\n        `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2`  (Equation 2)\n    *   For the neutrino (nu), which is considered massless (`m_nu = 0`):\n        `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0`  => `E_nu = p*c` (Equation 3)\n\n**4. Solving for Energies:**\nWe can substitute `p*c` from Equation 3 into Equation 2:\n`E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can express `E_nu` in terms of `E_mu`:\n`E_nu = M_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\nNow substitute this into the previous equation:\n`E_mu^2 = (M_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the squared term:\n`E_mu^2 = (M_pi * c^2)^2 - 2*(M_pi * c^2)*E_mu + E_mu^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nCancel `E_mu^2` from both sides and rearrange to solve for `E_mu`:\n`2*(M_pi * c^2)*E_mu = (M_pi * c^2)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2`\n`E_mu = [ (M_pi * c^2)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (M_pi * c^2) ]`\n\n**5. Calculation:**\nUsing the provided values:\n*   `M_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n*   `M_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n\n`E_mu = [ (139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`E_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / 279.2`\n`E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n`KE_mu = E_mu - M_mu * c^2`\n`KE_mu = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV`\n\nNow, find the energy of the neutrino (`E_nu`) using energy conservation (Equation 1):\n`E_nu = M_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n`E_nu = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = 29.78 MeV`\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy (`KE_nu`) is equal to its total energy:\n`KE_nu = E_nu = 29.78 MeV`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (mu+): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (nu): **29.78 MeV** (which is approximately 29.8 MeV)\n\nThese calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
