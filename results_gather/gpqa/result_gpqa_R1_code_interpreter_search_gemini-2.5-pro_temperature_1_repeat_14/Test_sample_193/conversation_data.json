    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its States:**\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n    Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n    The states can be represented by a tuple (S1, S2, S3).\n\n2.  **Define the Energy of the System:**\n    The energy of a given state is given by the formula:\n    E = -J * [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n    where J is a constant.\n\n3.  **Define the Partition Function:**\n    The partition function, Z, is a sum over all possible states of the system, given by:\n    Z = Σ_i exp(-β * E_i)\n    where the sum is over all 8 microstates, β = 1/(kT), and E_i is the energy of the i-th state.\n    Alternatively, if there are degenerate energy levels, the partition function can be written as:\n    Z = Σ_n g_n * exp(-β * E_n)\n    where the sum is over the distinct energy levels E_n, and g_n is the degeneracy (number of states) of each energy level.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy for Each State:**\n    We need to systematically list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one. Let's denote a state by (S1, S2, S3).\n\n    *   **State 1:** (+1, +1, +1)\n        E = -J * [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J * [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2:** (+1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J * [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J * [1 - 1 - 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 3:** (+1, -1, +1)\n        E = -J * [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J * [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 4:** (-1, +1, +1)\n        E = -J * [(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J * [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 5:** (+1, -1, -1)\n        E = -J * [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J * [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 6:** (-1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J * [(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J * [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 7:** (-1, -1, +1)\n        E = -J * [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J * [1 - 1 - 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 8:** (-1, -1, -1)\n        E = -J * [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J * [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n5.  **Identify Energy Levels and Their Degeneracies:**\n    By examining the energies calculated above, we can group the states by their energy levels.\n\n    *   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n        This energy level corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        The number of states with this energy is 2. Therefore, the degeneracy g1 = 2.\n\n    *   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n        This energy level corresponds to the remaining 6 states:\n        (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n        The number of states with this energy is 6. Therefore, the degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z:**\n    Now we can use the formula Z = g1 * exp(-β * E1) + g2 * exp(-β * E2).\n    Substitute the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\n    Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's compare our result with the given choices:\n    A) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n    B) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\n    C) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n    D) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\n\n    Our calculated partition function, Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
