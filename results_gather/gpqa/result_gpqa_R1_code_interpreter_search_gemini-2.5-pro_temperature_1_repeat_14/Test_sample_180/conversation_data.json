    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Baseline Solar Neutrino Spectrum\n\nFirst, we need to understand the sources of solar neutrinos and their energy spectra. The Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways:\n\n*   **Proton-Proton (pp) Chain:** This is the dominant energy source in the Sun and has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III), plus other minor related reactions.\n    *   **pp-I:** Produces `pp` neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 0.42 MeV (420 keV).\n    *   **pp-II:** Produces `7Be` neutrinos. These are emitted at two discrete energies (lines): a major line at **0.861 MeV (861 keV)** (90% of the time) and a minor one at 0.384 MeV (10%).\n    *   **pp-III:** Produces `8B` (Boron-8) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV.\n    *   **pep reaction:** Produces a discrete line at 1.44 MeV.\n\n*   **CNO Cycle:** A secondary set of reactions that also produce neutrinos (e.g., from `13N` and `15O` decay) with continuous spectra, mostly in the 0.5-1.7 MeV range. While it contributes only ~1% to the Sun's energy, its neutrinos are present.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Energy Bands\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands:\n*   **Band 1:** 700 keV to 800 keV (0.7 MeV to 0.8 MeV)\n*   **Band 2:** 800 keV to 900 keV (0.8 MeV to 0.9 MeV)\n\nLet's see which neutrino sources contribute to these bands in the normal state:\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The `pp` neutrinos are below this range.\n    *   The `7Be` and `pep` neutrinos are discrete lines that do not fall in this band.\n    *   The continuous spectrum of `8B` neutrinos (from pp-III) and CNO neutrinos fall within this range.\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The main `7Be` line at **861 keV** (from pp-II) falls squarely in this band. This is a very strong source of neutrinos.\n    *   The continuous spectrum of `8B` neutrinos (from pp-III) and CNO neutrinos also contribute to this band.\n\n### 3. Apply the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states: \"**the pp-III branch suddenly stopped... while all other reactions remained as they were.**\"\n\n*   The pp-III branch is the source of **8B neutrinos**. So, the flux from 8B neutrinos becomes zero.\n*   \"All other reactions\" means pp-I, pp-II, pep, and the CNO cycle continue to operate as normal.\n\n### 4. Re-evaluate the Fluxes After the Change\n\nNow, let's calculate the fluxes in each band under the new condition (no 8B neutrinos):\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from 8B neutrinos is gone.\n    *   The only remaining sources are the continuous spectra from the **CNO cycle neutrinos**. This results in a small but non-zero flux.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from 8B neutrinos is gone.\n    *   However, the very strong **7Be neutrino line at 861 keV** remains, because it is produced by the pp-II branch, which is unaffected.\n    *   There is also a small remaining contribution from CNO neutrinos in this band.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Approximate Ratio\n\nThe question asks for the ratio: Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2).\n\n*   **Numerator: Flux (band 1)** = Flux from CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range.\n*   **Denominator: Flux (band 2)** = Flux from the 7Be line at 861 keV + Flux from CNO neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range.\n\nTo get an approximate value, we need to compare the magnitudes of these fluxes. We can use standard solar model data.\n\n*   **Flux of the 7Be line (861 keV):** This is a very large flux, approximately 4.5 x 10^9 neutrinos / (cm²·s). This will dominate the denominator.\n*   **Flux of CNO neutrinos:** The *total* flux from the main CNO reactions (`13N`, `15O`) is approximately 5 x 10^8 neutrinos / (cm²·s). This total flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV). The flux within the narrow 100 keV window of Band 1 will be only a small fraction of this total.\n\nLet's make a rough, order-of-magnitude estimate:\n*   **Denominator (Flux in Band 2):** Is dominated by the 7Be line. So, Flux(band 2) ≈ Flux(7Be) ≈ 4.5 x 10^9.\n*   **Numerator (Flux in Band 1):** This is a fraction of the total CNO flux. Let's approximate the fraction as the ratio of the band's width (100 keV) to the spectrum's total width (~1700 keV). Fraction ≈ 100/1700 ≈ 0.06.\n    Flux(band 1) ≈ (Total CNO Flux) × (fraction) ≈ (5 x 10^8) × 0.06 ≈ 3 x 10^7.\n\nNow, we can compute the ratio:\nRatio = Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) ≈ (3 x 10^7) / (4.5 x 10^9) = 3 / 450 = 1 / 150 ≈ 0.0067\n\n### 6. Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.0067. Let's look at the given options:\nA) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nB) 10\nC) 1\nD) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\nOur calculated value of ~0.007 is very close to 0.01. The small difference arises from the rough approximations used for the CNO spectral shape. A more precise calculation would yield a result even closer to 0.01. Therefore, 0.01 is the best and most plausible answer.\n\nThe key to the problem is realizing that after the 8B flux disappears, the flux in Band 2 is dominated by the very strong, unaffected 7Be line, while the flux in Band 1 is reduced to the much weaker CNO background flux. This makes the ratio very small and non-zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
