    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the particle.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often easier to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) if the potential simplifies. The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r * cos(θ)\ny = r * sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these relationships, we can see that:\nx^2 = (r * cos(θ))^2 = r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\n**2. Simplify the Cartesian Potential**\n\nCombine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) * k ) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**3. Identify the System as Two Independent Harmonic Oscillators**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of a function of x and a function of y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * ky^2\n\nThis structure means the system behaves as two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, one oscillating in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction. The total energy of the system will be the sum of the energies of these two oscillators.\n\n**4. Determine the Angular Frequencies (ω)**\n\nThe potential for a standard 1D quantum harmonic oscillator is given by V(q) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * q^2. We compare our potentials V_x(x) and V_y(y) to this standard form to find their respective angular frequencies (ω_x and ω_y).\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 * m * ω_x^2 * x^2\n    4k = m * ω_x^2\n    ω_x^2 = 4k / m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 * ky^2 = 1/2 * m * ω_y^2 * y^2\n    k = m * ω_y^2\n    ω_y^2 = k / m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n\n**5. Find the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with quantum number n are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n*   **Energy for the x-oscillator (E_x):**\n    E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n*   **Energy for the y-oscillator (E_y):**\n    E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression:\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
