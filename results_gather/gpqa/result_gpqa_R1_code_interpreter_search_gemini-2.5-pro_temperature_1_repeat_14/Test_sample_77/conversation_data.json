    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The potentials V and $\\vec{A}$ at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time t due to time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the **retarded time**. It is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) must have been emitted from the source position $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    The evaluation of these integrals is a standard procedure in electrodynamics. The delta function $\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))$ is tricky because the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n    Let's use the notation from the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n    The retarded time condition is $t_r = t - d/c$.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{t_r} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the bracket ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Final Expressions for V and A**\n    Substituting this result back into the integral for the scalar potential $V$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    Similarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$, the velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is treated as a constant during the spatial integration and can be pulled out:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match option B exactly.\n\n    *   Option A has a plus sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n    *   Option C gives the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect for a moving charge, and has a dimensionally incorrect relation for A.\n    *   Option D also gives the static potential for V, which is incorrect. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
