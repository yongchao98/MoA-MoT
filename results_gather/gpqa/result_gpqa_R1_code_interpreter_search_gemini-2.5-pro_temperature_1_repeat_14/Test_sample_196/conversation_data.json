  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of Compound X from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this region (9-13 ppm) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group.\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2H is a -CH₂ group, likely situated between two other carbon atoms.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1H is a -CH group, likely attached to the benzene ring (making it a benzylic proton, hence its downfield shift) and other carbons.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The -CH group (2.9 ppm) is attached to the ring. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (-CH₃) must be attached to this -CH group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (-CH₃) must be attached to the -CH₂ group (1.7 ppm). Finally, the -CH₂ group must also be attached to the benzylic -CH group. This forms the structure: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, Compound X is a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. The name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction and the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and HI**.\n    *   **Reagents' Function:** This combination (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the saturated alkyl chain (sec-butyl group) will not be affected by this reaction.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   Final Product: The resulting molecule will have a methyl group where the carboxylic acid was, and the sec-butyl group will remain in the para position. The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure and functional group.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
