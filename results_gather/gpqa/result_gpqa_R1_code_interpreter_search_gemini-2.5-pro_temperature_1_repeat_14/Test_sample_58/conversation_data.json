    "This problem requires us to calculate the pH of a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). Here's a step-by-step approach to solve it.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will react with all available acidic protons. The reaction with the strong acid (H+ from HCl) happens first and completely, followed by the reaction with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   Since there is more OH- than H+, all the H+ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n    *   Since there is more OH- than CH3COOH, all the weak acid will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining (in excess) = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final concentration of the excess species.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains 0.050 mol of excess OH- ions. The pH of the final solution will be determined by this excess strong base. First, we need to find the total volume of the mixture.\n\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions.\n\n*   [OH-] = (Moles of excess OH-) / (Total Volume)\n*   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167)\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n\nNow let's compute the final values.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of excess OH-\nmoles_oh_excess = 0.050\n\n# Total volume in Liters\ntotal_volume = 1.2\n\n# Final concentration of OH-\nconcentration_oh = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=}\")\n```\n```output\npH=12.619788758287236\n```\nThe calculated pH is approximately 12.62.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 12.62\nB) 8.68\nC) 8.92\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem involves mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH is determined by which species is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species:**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = **0.080 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H+ donors):**\n    *   Total acid = Moles H+ (from HCl) + Moles CH3COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates to produce two OH- ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 * 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the excess reactant after neutralization:**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons. The reaction with the strong acid's H⁺ happens first, followed by the reaction with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\n\n*   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n*   Total moles of acid (H⁺ + CH3COOH) = 0.130 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of base than acid, the strong base will be in excess.\n\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = Moles OH⁻ (initial) - Moles acid (total)\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**.\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻:**\n\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base. First, find the total volume of the solution.\n\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**.\n\nNow, calculate the final concentration of OH⁻.\n\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**4. Calculate pOH and pH:**\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
