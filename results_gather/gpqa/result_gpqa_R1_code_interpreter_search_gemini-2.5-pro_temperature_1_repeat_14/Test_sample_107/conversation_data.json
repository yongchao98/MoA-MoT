    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The core of the question is to compare the magnitude of two distinct energy quantities related to the Hydrogen atom:\n    *   **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**: This is the energy shift experienced by an atomic energy level due to an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect.\n    *   **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels, which corresponds to the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during a transition. This energy is given by its wavelength.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n    The interaction energy of an atom's orbital magnetic moment ($\\vec{\\mu}_L$) with an external magnetic field ($\\vec{B}$) is given by the Hamiltonian:\n    $$ H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\n    The orbital magnetic moment is proportional to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$:\n    $$ \\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} $$\n    where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n    The Hamiltonian becomes:\n    $$ H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\n    The problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so we can write $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction energy then depends on the z-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$:\n    $$ H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}L_z $$\n    In quantum mechanics, $L_z$ is quantized, and its eigenvalues are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The expectation value of the energy shift, which is the paramagnetic coupling term, is:\n    $$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e}(m\\hbar) = m \\left(\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\right) B $$\n    The term in the parenthesis is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$)**.\n    $$ \\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T} $$\n    So, the formula for the energy shift simplifies to:\n    $$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $$\n    We are given $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$ and are told to consider \"small values of m\". We can take $m=1$ as a representative case (as $m=0$ would give zero shift).\n    $$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\cdot (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) $$\n    $$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\n    The order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is $\\sim 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n    The energy of a photon ($\\Delta E$) is related to its wavelength ($\\lambda$) by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n    $$ \\Delta E = hf = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n    where $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    We are given the wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$. This wavelength is in the visible spectrum (it corresponds to the blue-green line of the Balmer series in hydrogen, the $n=4 \\to n=2$ transition).\n    A convenient formula for converting wavelength in nanometers to energy in electron-volts (eV) is:\n    $$ \\Delta E \\, (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{\\lambda \\, (\\text{nm})} $$\n    Plugging in the given wavelength:\n    $$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\n    The order of magnitude of the transition energy is $\\sim 1 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes**\n    Now we compare the two calculated energy values:\n    *   Paramagnetic Coupling Term: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n    *   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n    Let's find the ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n    The ratio is a very small number, which indicates that the paramagnetic coupling term is significantly smaller than the transition energy. The difference is about five orders of magnitude.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    Since $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ is much smaller than $\\Delta E$, we can write the relationship as:\n    $$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n    This aligns with the fact that the Zeeman effect is a fine structure perturbation to the main electronic energy levels of an atom.\n\n<<<C>>>"
