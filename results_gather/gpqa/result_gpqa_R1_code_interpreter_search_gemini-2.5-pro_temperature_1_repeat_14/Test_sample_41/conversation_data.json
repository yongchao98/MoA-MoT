    "This problem requires us to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, Planet3 and Planet1, based on their equilibrium temperatures. The masses of the planets and their specific albedo value are extraneous information, as long as the albedo is uniform across all planets.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = [ L_star * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d^2) ]^(1/4)`\n    where `L_star` is the star's luminosity, `A` is the albedo, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `d` is the orbital distance.\n\n    Since `L_star`, `A`, and `σ` are the same for all planets in the system, we can establish a proportionality:\n    `T_eq ∝ (1 / d^2)^(1/4) ∝ d^(-1/2)`\n\n    When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (e.g., Planet `a` and Planet `b`), we get:\n    `T_a / T_b = (d_a / d_b)^(-1/2) = (d_b / d_a)^(1/2)`\n    This can be rearranged to find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    `d_b / d_a = (T_a / T_b)^2`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratios of Orbital Distances:**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\n    Using the formula from step 1, we find the distance ratios:\n    *   `d2 / d1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96`\n    *   `d3 / d2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29`\n\n    To find the overall distance ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 (`d3 / d1`), we multiply the individual ratios:\n    `d3 / d1 = (d3 / d2) * (d2 / d1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its orbital distance (`d`):\n    `P^2 ∝ d^3` or `P ∝ d^(3/2)`\n\n    For two planets in the same system, the ratio of their periods is:\n    `P3 / P1 = (d3 / d1)^(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:**\n    Now we substitute the value of `d3 / d1` we found in step 2 into the equation from step 3.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nT_ratio_12 = 1.4  # T_eq1 / T_eq2\nT_ratio_23 = 2.3  # T_eq2 / T_eq3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital distances\n# d_b / d_a = (T_a / T_b)^2\nd_ratio_21 = T_ratio_12**2\nd_ratio_32 = T_ratio_23**2\n\n# Calculate the total distance ratio d3 / d1\nd_ratio_31 = d_ratio_32 * d_ratio_21\n\n# Use Kepler's Third Law to find the period ratio P3 / P1\n# P_a / P_b = (d_a / d_b)^(3/2)\nP_ratio_31 = d_ratio_31**(3/2)\n\nprint(P_ratio_31)\n```\n<<<\n33.38531238902035\n\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user has provided the output from the code execution, which confirms the calculation.\n\n**Reasoning and Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the star's luminosity (`L`), the planet's albedo (`A`), and its distance from the star (`d`). The formula is:\n    `T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d^2)]^(1/4)`\n    Since `L`, `A`, `π`, and `σ` (the Stefan-Boltzmann constant) are constants for all three planets, we can see the relationship between temperature and distance:\n    `T_eq ∝ (1/d^2)^(1/4)` which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ d^(-1/2)`.\n    This means the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature: `d ∝ T_eq^(-2)`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital distances of two planets (`a` and `b`) is related to the ratio of their temperatures by:\n    `d_b / d_a = (T_a / T_b)^2`\n\n2.  **Calculate Orbital Distance Ratios:**\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n    Using the relationship from step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n    *   `d2 / d1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96`\n    *   `d3 / d2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29`\n    To find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (`d3 / d1`), we multiply the individual ratios:\n    `d3 / d1 = (d3 / d2) * (d2 / d1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Period and Orbital Distance (Kepler's Third Law):**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (or orbital distance `d` for a circular orbit):\n    `P^2 ∝ d^3`\n    This can be written as a proportionality: `P ∝ d^(3/2)`.\n    The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is therefore:\n    `P3 / P1 = (d3 / d1)^(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:**\n    Substituting the value of `d3 / d1` we found in step 2:\n    `P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)`\n    The code execution confirms this calculation:\n    `(10.3684)^1.5 ≈ 33.386`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~ 10.4\n    B) ~ 3.2\n    C) ~ 4.4\n    D) ~ 33.4\n\n    The calculated value matches option D. The information about the planets' masses and the specific albedo value (0.3) is not needed for the calculation, as long as the albedo is the same for all planets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
