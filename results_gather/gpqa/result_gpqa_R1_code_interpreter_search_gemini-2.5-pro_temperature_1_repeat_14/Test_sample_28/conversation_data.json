    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main objective is to eliminate an \"anti-nutritional compound\" produced by a specific gene. This means we need to disrupt the gene's function so it can no longer produce the corresponding functional protein (likely an enzyme) that synthesizes this compound.\n\n2.  **Understand the Tools (Mutations):** The problem presents four different mutations. To choose the most effective one, we need to understand the different types of mutations and their likely impact on a protein's function.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. This has no effect on the protein's function.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a single amino acid substitution in the protein. This *might* disrupt the protein's function if the change occurs in a critical region (like the active site), but it could also have little to no effect. It's not a guaranteed \"knockout.\"\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that creates a premature \"stop\" codon. This causes the ribosome to stop translation, resulting in a truncated, and almost always non-functional, protein. The earlier the stop codon appears, the more certain the loss of function.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence downstream from the mutation. This almost always leads to a completely non-functional protein and often results in a premature stop codon being created in the new reading frame.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The starting point is the normal, functional gene. We need to translate its sequence to have a baseline for comparison. The DNA is read in groups of three called codons.\n    *   Intact Gene: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... –3’`\n    *   The corresponding mRNA codons would be: `AUG UUU CUC GCU GGU ACU UCU ...`\n    *   Translating these using a codon table gives the protein sequence: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser ...`\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequentially:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... –3’`\n        *   Comparison to Intact:\n            *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a silent mutation.\n            *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**.\n        *   Impact: The protein will have one amino acid changed (Leu -> Tyr). This *might* eliminate function, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... –3’`\n        *   Comparison to Intact:\n            *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n            *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), but `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   Impact: This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phe). The resulting product will be a tiny dipeptide (`Met-Phe`), which is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for achieving the goal.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... –3’`\n        *   Comparison to Intact: This mutant has multiple single-base changes leading to several amino acid substitutions.\n            *   `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr)\n            *   `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val)\n            *   `TCT` (Ser) -> `ACT` (Thr)\n        *   Impact: These are multiple **missense mutations**. While several changes make loss of function more likely than a single change, it's still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... –3’`\n        *   Comparison to Intact: Let's align the full sequences provided.\n            *   Intact:   `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT` (45 bases)\n            *   Mutant 4: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT` (42 bases)\n        *   Impact: The mutant sequence is shorter by 3 bases. A deletion of 3 bases (one full codon) would remove one amino acid without changing the reading frame. However, careful alignment shows the changes are more complex, resulting in a **frameshift mutation**. A frameshift scrambles the entire downstream protein sequence, which is a catastrophic event for the protein and is certain to eliminate its function.\n\n5.  **Compare the \"Best\" Candidates:**\n    We have identified two mutations that are highly likely to eliminate the protein's function:\n    *   **Mutant 2 (Nonsense):** Introduces a stop codon at the 3rd position.\n    *   **Mutant 4 (Frameshift):** Scrambles the protein from the 5th amino acid onward.\n\n    Both are excellent ways to create a \"knockout\" mutant. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is arguably the most direct and definitive. It causes translation to halt immediately at a very early position (codon 3), producing a minuscule, non-functional peptide. There is zero ambiguity about its effect. Therefore, it is the *most probable* mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
