    "This problem requires calculating the distribution of cobalt(II) species in a solution containing thiocyanate ions. The percentage of a specific complex, in this case, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex [Co(SCN)2], can be determined using the provided overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Equilibria**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]`\n\nThe formation of each complex is governed by its overall stability constant (β):\n*   `[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n**2. Formulate the Fraction of the Target Species**\n\nWe want to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]. The fraction (α2) of this species is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the equilibrium expressions into the total concentration equation, we can express c(Co) in terms of the free Co(II) concentration, `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nNow, we can write the fraction α2 as:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3. Approximate the Free Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of the ligand SCN- is 0.1 M, and the total concentration of the metal Co(II) is 10^-2 M (or 0.01 M). Since the ligand is in significant excess ([SCN-]total >> c(Co)), the amount of SCN- consumed to form complexes is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN^-]` as being equal to its total concentration.\n`[SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**4. Calculate the Percentage**\n\nNow we can plug the given values into the equation for α2.\n\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nWe will use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator of the fraction equation\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing all cobalt species\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nfraction_co_scn2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_co_scn2 = fraction_co_scn2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of the [Co(SCN)2] complex is: {percentage_co_scn2:.1f}%\")\n```\nThe calculation yields a result of 16.9%. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN^-`) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co^2+` and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by their overall stability constants (βn):\n*   `[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n**2. Formulate the Fraction of the Target Complex**\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`. The fraction of this species, denoted as `α2`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the equilibrium expressions into the total concentration equation, we can express `c(Co)` in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nNow, we can write the formula for `α2`:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3. Approximate the Free Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of thiocyanate is 0.1 M, and the total concentration of cobalt is 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M). Since the ligand `(SCN^-)` is present in a 10-fold excess compared to the metal `(Co)`, we can make the common approximation that the concentration of free ligand `[SCN^-]` is nearly equal to its total initial concentration.\n`[SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**4. Calculate the Percentage**\n\nNow, we plug the given values into the formula for `α2`:\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\n**Numerator:**\n`β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n**Denominator:**\n`1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4`\n`= 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n`= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n`= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`= 2.3646`\n\n**Fraction (α2):**\n`α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**Percentage:**\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the value confirmed by the code execution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
