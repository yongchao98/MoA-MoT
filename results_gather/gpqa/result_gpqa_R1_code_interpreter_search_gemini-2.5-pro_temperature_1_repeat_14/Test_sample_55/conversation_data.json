    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Process and States**\n-   Initial state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state of the hydrogen atom.\n-   Final state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n-   Transition mechanism: Two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\n**2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules**\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition from a state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ are:\n-   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n-   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n-   $\\Delta n$ can be any non-zero integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n    -   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to the initial state with $l=0$: $l_i - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l_i$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_i = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-state.\n    -   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to the initial state with $m=0$: $m_i - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m_i = -1, 0, 1$.\n    -   For a decay, we need $n_i < n=3$. So, $n_i$ could be 1 or 2.\n    -   However, the quantum number $l$ must be less than $n$ ($l \\le n-1$). Since $l_i=1$, we must have $n_i \\ge l_i+1 = 2$.\n    -   Combining these conditions ($n_i<3$ and $n_i\\ge 2$), the only possible principal quantum number for the intermediate state is $n_i = 2$.\n    -   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|2, 1, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n    -   Let's check if a transition from our determined intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $l_i=1$. Final state: $l_f=0$. So $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Final state: $m_f=0$. So $\\Delta m = 0 - m_i = -m_i$. This is $0, \\mp 1$, which is allowed for all three values of $m_i$.\n    -   Initial (intermediate) state: $n_i=2$. Final state: $n_f=1$. So $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    -   Thus, all three states $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ can decay to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n\nThe overall decay proceeds via one of these three routes (cascades):\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\nThe probability of the atom taking a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, since the second step is the only possible decay channel for the 2p state (it cannot decay to 2s, and higher states are not accessible via decay).\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$A(i \\rightarrow f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$\n\nWe need to calculate this for the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$. The radial part of the integral will be the same for all three values of $m_i$. We only need to compare the angular parts.\n\nA key principle of quantum mechanics (related to the Wigner-Eckart theorem and spherical symmetry) is that the decay of a spherically symmetric state (like any s-state, with $l=0$) into the different magnetic sublevels of a higher-$l$ state occurs with equal probability. The $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state has no preferred direction in space, so there is no reason for it to preferentially decay to one $m_i$ state over another.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation. The transition rate to a specific final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ is given by the sum of squares of the matrix elements for the components of the dipole operator $\\mathbf{r}$.\nLet $I_{rad}$ be the common radial integral.\n-   **For the transition to $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$:** The selection rule for the $z$ operator ($z = r \\cos\\theta$) is $\\Delta m = 0$. The rules for $x$ and $y$ operators are $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$. So only the $\\langle z \\rangle$ matrix element is non-zero.\n    $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Calculation shows the angular part squared is $1/3$. So, $A \\propto |I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n-   **For the transition to $|2, 1, \\pm 1\\rangle$:** Only the $\\langle x \\rangle$ and $\\langle y \\rangle$ matrix elements are non-zero.\n    $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,\\pm 1\\rangle) \\propto |\\langle 2,1,\\pm 1 | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,\\pm 1 | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Calculation shows this sum is $|I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6}) = |I_{rad}|^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSo, the transition rates for all three possible intermediate states are equal:\n$A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nThe total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of these three rates. The probability (or branching ratio) for decaying into any one specific intermediate state is:\n$P(\\text{via } |2,1,m_i\\rangle) = \\frac{A_m}{A_{-1} + A_0 + A_1} = \\frac{A_0}{A_0 + A_0 + A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, each of the three possible cascade routes has a probability of $1/3$.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\nWe now check which of the given options is consistent with our findings.\n-   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n-   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n-   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect. (Assuming the typo `\\rangle` means $|3,0,0\\rangle$).\n-   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This states a correct possible route with the correct probability.\n\nAlthough there are three possible routes, each with probability 1/3, option D is the only choice that presents a factually correct statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
