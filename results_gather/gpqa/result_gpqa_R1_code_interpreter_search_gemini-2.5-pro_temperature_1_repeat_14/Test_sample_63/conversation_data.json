    "Here is my thinking process to solve the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\nFirst, I'll break down the information provided in the question into manageable pieces.\n\n*   **Mixture:** An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B.\n*   **Mass:** Total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   **Reaction:** The mixture is heated to 200°C, decomposing completely into a mixture of gases.\n*   **Gas Analysis:** The resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes:\n    1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** A strong drying agent. Its weight increased by 3.60 g. This directly tells me the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** Limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Its weight did not change. This implies no such acidic gases were formed.\n    3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures is a reducing agent and can react with oxidizing gases like O₂ or N₂O. Its weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This increase in mass is purely from the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n*   **Final Gas:** After all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B.\n\n### 2. Quantitative Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nI will now calculate the number of moles for each product identified.\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O) reacting with Copper:**\n    *   The mass increase of the copper tube is the mass of oxygen atoms that formed CuO.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas. Two common possibilities are O₂ or N₂O.\n        *   If it was O₂, the reaction is `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. Moles of O₂ would be 0.025 mol (since O₂ has two oxygen atoms).\n        *   If it was N₂O, the reaction is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. Moles of N₂O would be 0.05 mol.\n    *   Let's keep both possibilities in mind.\n\n*   **Gas C:**\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C has passed through a water absorber, a base, and hot copper without reacting. This strongly suggests it is nitrogen gas (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 3. Determining the Elemental Composition of the Salts\n\nSince the salts decomposed completely into gases containing H, O, and N, the original salts must be composed exclusively of these three elements. Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The total nitrogen ended up as Gas C (N₂) and possibly in the N₂O that reacted with copper.\n    *   Let's assume the N₂O scenario as it's a common decomposition product. The gas entering Tube 3 is a mix of N₂ and N₂O. The gas leaving is all N₂.\n    *   The final N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of the N₂ from the initial decomposition and the N₂ produced from the reduction of N₂O.\n    *   Reaction in Tube 3: `N₂O → N₂ + [O]`. So, 0.05 mol of N₂O produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = (N₂ from decomposition) + (N₂ from N₂O)\n    *   0.10 mol = (N₂ from decomposition) + 0.05 mol\n    *   So, N₂ from decomposition = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂ from decomp) + 2 × (moles of N₂O) = 2 × 0.05 + 2 × 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the N₂O.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in N₂O)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (1 × moles of N₂O) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the masses add up:\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass perfectly.\n\n### 4. Identifying Salts A and B\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A and `n` be the moles of salt B. The total mass is `n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20`, where `M_A` and `M_B` are the molar masses.\n\nThe total elemental content for `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B is N₀.₂₀H₀.₄₀O₀.₂₅.\nIf we consider the combined formula of (A+B), the ratio of atoms is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N:H:O = 4:8:5.\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThe molar mass of this combined unit is `M_A + M_B`.\n`M(N₄H₈O₅) = 4*14 + 8*1 + 5*16 = 56 + 8 + 80 = 144` g/mol.\nSo, `M_A + M_B = 144` g/mol.\n\nWe can now find the value of `n`:\n`n * (M_A + M_B) = 7.20`\n`n * 144 = 7.20`\n`n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05` mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B.\n\nNow I need to find two common salts (A and B) made of N, H, and O that, when their formulas are added, result in N₄H₈O₅.\nLet's consider common ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**\n*   Ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃** → Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**\n\nLet's check if these fit:\n*   **Formula Sum:** (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n*   **Molar Mass Sum:**\n    *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Sum = 64 + 80 = **144 g/mol**. This is also a perfect match.\n*   **Decomposition Reactions:**\n    *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)` (This happens around 200°C)\n    These reactions produce the exact gases (N₂, H₂O, N₂O) we deduced earlier.\n\nSo, salt A is NH₄NO₂ and salt B is NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa).\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nI will run a final check using a Python script to verify all calculations.\n```python\n# Constants\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 15.999\n\n# Given values\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_increase_Cu = 0.80  # g\nvol_gas_C = 2.24  # L\n\n# Calculate moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / (2*M_H + M_O)\nmoles_O_reacted = mass_increase_Cu / M_O\nmoles_gas_C_N2 = vol_gas_C / 22.4\n\n# Assuming the gas reacting with Cu is N2O\nmoles_N2O = moles_O_reacted\n# N2O decomposes to N2 + O, so moles N2 from N2O = moles_N2O\nmoles_N2_from_N2O = moles_N2O\n# Total N2 is Gas C\nmoles_N2_initial = moles_gas_C_N2 - moles_N2_from_N2O\n\n# Calculate total moles of each element in the original mixture\ntotal_moles_H = 2 * moles_H2O\ntotal_moles_N = 2 * moles_N2_initial + 2 * moles_N2O\ntotal_moles_O = 1 * moles_H2O + 1 * moles_N2O\n\n# Identify the salts\n# Combined formula is (A+B) = N_x H_y O_z\n# x:y:z = total_moles_N : total_moles_H : total_moles_O\n# Ratio N:H:O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25 -> 4:8:5\n# So, A+B = N4H8O5\n# Salt A = NH4NO2 (N2H4O2)\n# Salt B = NH4NO3 (N2H4O3)\n# (N2H4O2) + (N2H4O3) = N4H8O5. Correct.\n\n# Calculate atoms\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2  # N, H, O in NH4NO2\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3  # N, H, O in NH4NO3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"The identified salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in NH4NO2: {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in NH4NO3: {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in both salts: {total_atoms}\")\n```\nThe logic holds and the calculation is confirmed. The final answer is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Analyze the Gas Analysis Data**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed in the decomposition. This tells us the original salts do not contain Carbon or Sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperature reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is purely the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O atoms**.\n    *   Since the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common theme in such problems), a very common oxidizing gas produced during decomposition is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. In this reaction, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of oxygen atoms to the copper. Therefore, the amount of N₂O that passed through this tube was **0.05 mol N₂O**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas passed through a water absorber, a base, and hot copper without reacting. This strongly indicates the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe decomposition produced H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. Therefore, the original salts A and B must be composed only of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms ended up in the water.\n    *   Total H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The total N₂ collected (Gas C) is the sum of N₂ produced directly in the decomposition and the N₂ produced from the reduction of N₂O in tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ collected = 0.10 mol.\n    *   N₂ from N₂O reduction (`Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`) = moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, N₂ produced directly from decomposition = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (2 × moles of N₂ from decomp.) + (2 × moles of N₂O) = (2 × 0.05) + (2 × 0.05) = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in the produced H₂O and N₂O.\n    *   Total O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in N₂O) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n*   **Verify Mass:** Let's check if the masses of the elements add up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n    *   Mass H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Mass O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g. This matches perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture. The combined empirical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B can be found from the molar ratio of the elements:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts made of N, H, and O that add up to this formula. Let's consider common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check if they fit:\n*   **Sum of Formulas:** (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n*   **Decomposition Reactions (at ~200°C):**\n    *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    These reactions produce exactly the gases we identified (N₂, N₂O, and H₂O) in the correct molar ratios.\n\nTherefore, Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
