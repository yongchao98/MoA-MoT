    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the conserved quantity:** In this system, the total energy is conserved. The total energy $E_{total}$ of a relativistic particle in a potential field $U(x)$ is the sum of its relativistic energy $E$ and its potential energy $U(x)$. The relativistic energy $E$ is the sum of the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K$).\n    $E_{total} = E + U(x) = (K + mc^2) + U(x)$\n\n2.  **Express energy in terms of velocity:** The relativistic energy can be expressed using the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    So, the total conserved energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n\n3.  **Define the potential energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is the integral of the force with respect to position:\n    $U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = -\\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    So the conservation of energy equation becomes:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\n4.  **Analyze the state at maximum amplitude:** The maximum amplitude is $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy of the system can be calculated at this point:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n5.  **Analyze the state at maximum speed:** The maximum speed, $v_{max}$, occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The velocity is $v=v_{max}$. Let's denote the corresponding Lorentz factor as $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n6.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$:** Since the total energy is conserved, we can equate the expressions from steps 4 and 5:\n    $\\gamma_{max} mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Now, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, we need to solve for $v_{max}$. Let's perform the algebra:\n    a. Square both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    b. Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    c. Isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    d. Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:** The derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
