    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **-pyran-2-one**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran system) and a carbonyl group (ketone/ester) at position 2. The combination describes a δ-lactone (a cyclic ester with a 6-membered ring).\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (contains only single bonds between carbons).\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nLet's draw the basic structure and apply the IUPAC numbering for lactones, where the ring oxygen is position 1 and the carbonyl carbon is position 2.\n\n```\n      O=C(2)---C(3)H2\n     /         \\\n    O(1)        C(4)H-Et  <-- Chiral Center\n     \\         /\n      C(6)H2---C(5)H2\n```\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The linear precursor would be a 5-hydroxy acid with an ethyl group. Specifically, it would be a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material A:** A derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, specifically (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)\n    *   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu) at C5. The chiral center is at C3.\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride). We need to know its selectivity.\n    *   <search>selectivity of LiBH4 reduction of esters vs carboxylic acids</search>\n    *   <information>Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids. Under controlled conditions, it can selectively reduce an ester in the presence of a carboxylic acid.</information>\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.

Therefore, the stereochemistry at C3 is preserved throughout the reaction. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the final lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the stereocenter at C4 is (R). Because the configuration is conserved, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration at C3.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material B:** Same structural options as A.\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane). We need to know its selectivity.\n    *   <search>selectivity of BH3 reduction of carboxylic acids vs esters</search>\n    *   <information>Borane (BH3) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.

The ester group at C5 remains unchanged. The chiral center at C3 is not affected.\n        `HOOC-CH₂(2)-...-COO-iBu  --[BH₃]--> HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-iBu`\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol at C1 attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n        `HO-CH₂-...-COO-iBu --[H⁺]--> Lactone + iBu-OH`\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the reactions occur at the ends of the molecule (C1 and C5), and the chiral center at C3 is unaffected. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the final lactone product. The configuration is conserved.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the stereocenter at C4 is (S). Because the configuration is conserved, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration at C3.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

    "<information>### LiBH₄ Exhibits High Selectivity for Esters Over Carboxylic Acids\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent that preferentially reduces esters to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids largely unreacted. This selectivity makes it a valuable tool in organic synthesis when a molecule contains both functional groups and only the ester is targeted for reduction.\n\nThe difference in reactivity stems from the initial interaction between LiBH₄ and the two functional groups. Carboxylic acids, being acidic, will first undergo an acid-base reaction with the hydride reagent. This deprotonation results in the formation of a lithium carboxylate salt. The resulting carboxylate is electron-rich and therefore less electrophilic, making it resistant to reduction by the relatively mild LiBH₄.\n\nOn the other hand, esters are more susceptible to reduction by LiBH₄. The lithium cation (Li⁺) in LiBH₄ can coordinate to the carbonyl oxygen of the ester, polarizing the carbonyl group and making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and thus more susceptible to hydride attack. While LiBH₄ is a stronger reducing agent than sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), it is less potent than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). This intermediate reactivity allows it to reduce esters, a feat NaBH₄ struggles with, without being so reactive that it will readily reduce the unreactive carboxylate salt.\n\nIn practice, this selectivity allows for the reduction of an ester in the presence of a carboxylic acid, as well as other functional groups like tertiary amides and nitriles. The reaction is typically carried out in ethereal solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF), where LiBH₄ has good solubility.</information>"
