    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamic Strength of Oxygen as an Oxidant**\n\n1.  The first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n2.  The thermodynamic strength of an oxidizing agent is quantified by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidant because it has a greater tendency to be reduced (i.e., to accept electrons).\n3.  We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in a basic solution to its potential in an acidic solution, which is the standard point of comparison in electrochemistry.\n4.  The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in **acidic** solution is:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n5.  The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in **basic** solution is:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n6.  Comparing the two values, +0.40 V is significantly less positive than +1.23 V. This means that oxygen has a lower thermodynamic driving force to act as an oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n7.  Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics of Oxygen Reaction**\n\n1.  The second part of the statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n2.  Kinetics refers to the *rate* of a reaction, which is determined by the activation energy, not the overall thermodynamic potential.\n3.  The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is a notoriously complex and slow process. This is due to several factors:\n    *   **Strong Bond:** The O=O double bond in the oxygen molecule is very strong (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol) and requires a large amount of energy to break.\n    *   **Multi-electron Transfer:** The overall reaction involves the transfer of four electrons. Such multi-electron processes rarely occur in a single step. Instead, they proceed through a series of one-electron steps.\n    *   **Unfavorable Intermediates:** The initial one-electron reduction of O₂ to form the superoxide radical (O₂⁻) is thermodynamically unfavorable and has a high activation energy. This first step acts as a bottleneck for the entire reaction.\n4.  Because of this high activation energy barrier, the reduction of oxygen is kinetically very slow, or \"sluggish,\" in the absence of an effective catalyst. This is true even in acidic solution where the overall reaction is thermodynamically very favorable (E° = +1.23 V). This discrepancy between favorable thermodynamics and slow kinetics is a key concept in electrochemistry.\n5.  Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions (and in general).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   First blank: **weaker**\n*   Second blank: **slower**\n\nCombining these two findings, the correct choice is \"weaker – slower\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
