    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of a substituted halobenzene with sodium amide in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, with the active species being the amide ion (NH₂⁻).\n\n**2. The Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates):**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base and abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at C1. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6:**\n    The C6 position has a hydrogen atom. The amide ion can abstract this proton (H⁺).\n    `C₆H₅(Br at C1, D at C2) + NH₂⁻ → [C₆H₄(Br at C1, D at C2, - at C6)] + NH₃`\n    This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form a benzyne intermediate. The new triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step.\n    `[C₆H₄(Br at C1, D at C2, - at C6)] → 3-deuterobenzyne + Br⁻`\n    The intermediate is named 3-deuterobenzyne because the deuterium is at position 3 relative to the benzyne triple bond (C1-C6).\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2:**\n    The C2 position has a deuterium atom. The amide ion can also abstract this deuteron (D⁺).\n    `C₆H₅(Br at C1, D at C2) + NH₂⁻ → [C₆H₄(Br at C1, - at C2)] + NH₂D`\n    This is kinetically slower than abstracting a proton due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond). However, it is still a possible pathway.\n    Following the abstraction, the bromide ion is eliminated, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n    `[C₆H₄(Br at C1, - at C2)] → benzyne + Br⁻`\n    In this case, the deuterium atom has been removed from the ring, so the intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuterobenzyne** (from Path A) and **benzyne** (from Path B).\n\n**3. The Addition Step (Formation of Products):**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has -NH₂ at C1 and D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has -NH₂ at C6 and D at C2. This molecule is **3-deuteroaniline** (the -NH₂ and D are in a 1,3 relationship).\n\n*   **Products from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium on the ring. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation by NH₃, the resulting product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**4. Summary of Possible Products:**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three unique organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
