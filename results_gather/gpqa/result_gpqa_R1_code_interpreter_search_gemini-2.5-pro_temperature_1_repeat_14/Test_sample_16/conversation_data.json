    "The problem asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium:**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is formed from the reaction of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and the fully deprotonated form of EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The complex is stable, but it undergoes a slight dissociation back into its constituent ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant:**\n    We are given the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we use the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    The expression for $K_d$ is:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let's analyze the concentrations as the system reaches equilibrium. We start with 0.02 M of the complex, and it dissociates. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, the concentration of $EDTA^{4-}$ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species           | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :---------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The problem states that the pH is \"ideal,\" which means we can assume the EDTA is fully deprotonated as $EDTA^{4-}$ and we don't need to account for its protonated forms.\n\n4.  **Solve the equilibrium expression:**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the $K_d$ expression:\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This implies that the dissociation will be minimal, and 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). We can therefore simplify the denominator:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, we can solve for x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx (\\sqrt{40}) \\times 10^{-7}$\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.32.\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value is indeed much smaller than 0.02, confirming our initial approximation was valid.\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated concentration of $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
