    "*   **Initial State: Standard Maxwell's Equations**\n    Let's first recall the four Maxwell's equations in their standard differential form, which assume no magnetic monopoles.\n    1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ / ε₀\n        *   This says that the divergence (how much a field spreads out from a point) of the electric field **E** is proportional to the electric charge density ρ. Electric charges are the sources and sinks of electric fields.\n    2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0\n        *   This says that the divergence of the magnetic field **B** is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles (no isolated north or south poles). Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n    3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t\n        *   This says that the curl (circulation) of the electric field **E** is caused by a time-varying magnetic field **B**.\n    4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀ ∂**E**/∂t)\n        *   This says that the curl (circulation) of the magnetic field **B** is caused by an electric current **J** and/or a time-varying electric field **E**.\n\n*   **Introducing Magnetic Monopoles**\n    The question posits a universe with \"an isolated North or South pole.\" This is the definition of a magnetic monopole. If magnetic monopoles exist, they would be sources or sinks of the magnetic field, just as electric charges are for the electric field. Let's call the magnetic charge density ρ_m.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Impact on Each Equation**\n\n    1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇ ⋅ E):** This equation relates the electric field to electric charges. The existence of magnetic charges doesn't change this fundamental relationship. So, this equation remains the same.\n\n    2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B):** This equation, ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0, is the direct statement that there are *no* magnetic monopoles. If monopoles *did* exist, they would be sources of the magnetic field. The equation would have to be modified to include the magnetic charge density, becoming symmetric with Gauss's Law for electricity: ∇ ⋅ **B** = μ₀ρ_m (or some constant times ρ_m). **Therefore, this equation changes.** This equation is related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\n    3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E):** This law relates the curl of the electric field to a changing magnetic field. However, in a more symmetric universe, we would also expect a current of magnetic charges (a \"magnetic current,\" **J**_m) to produce a circulating electric field, just as an electric current (**J**) produces a circulating magnetic field in the Ampère-Maxwell law. So, a new term must be added: ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - μ₀**J**_m. **Therefore, this equation also changes.** This equation is related to the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.\n\n    4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law (∇ × B):** This law describes the sources of the circulating magnetic field as electric currents and changing electric fields. The existence of magnetic monopoles doesn't alter these sources. So, this equation remains the same.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The two equations that would be different are:\n    *   Gauss's Law for Magnetism, which deals with the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n    *   Faraday's Law of Induction, which deals with the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.\n\n    This corresponds directly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
