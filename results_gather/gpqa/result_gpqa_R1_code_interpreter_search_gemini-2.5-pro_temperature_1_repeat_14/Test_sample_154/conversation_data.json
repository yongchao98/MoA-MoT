    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**1. Understand the goal**\nThe objective is to compute the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, which is given by the formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle$ represents the expectation value of an operator $A$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$, calculated as $\\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\n**2. Define the operators and the state vector**\nFrom the problem description, we have the matrix for the operator $P_z$ and the column vector for the state $|\\psi\\rangle$. Let's set $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity in the intermediate steps and reintroduce it at the end.\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra-vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nFirst, let's compute the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with the resulting vector $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\n**4. Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\cdot0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)\\cdot(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we can calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, let's compute the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nNow we plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
