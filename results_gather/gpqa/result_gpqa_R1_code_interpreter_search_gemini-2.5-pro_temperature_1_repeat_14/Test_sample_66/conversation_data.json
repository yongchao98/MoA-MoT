    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, and its state is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ since the electrons are in p-orbitals.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Final State:** A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the joint probability of obtaining the following eigenvalues:\n    *   For $L_{1z}$, the eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For $L_{2z}$, the eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled basis state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Bases and Calculate Probability:** The probability of this measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state.\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Angular Momentum Coupling:** The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. That is, the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is zero unless $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n5.  **Check the Selection Rule for this Specific Case:**\n    *   For the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to $m = -1$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Because the selection rule $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is:\n    $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n**Alternative Reasoning using Eigenvalues:**\n\nThe operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\n*   The initial state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$. Therefore, a measurement of $L_z$ on this state will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n*   The final state we are considering, $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, corresponds to measuring $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$. For this state, the total z-component of angular momentum would be the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z} = -\\hbar + (-\\hbar) = -2\\hbar$. This means $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n\nThe initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator, $L_z$, but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are necessarily orthogonal.\n\nThis means the inner product (the projection) of the two states is zero:\n$\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe probability is the square of this inner product, which is 0. Thus, it is impossible to obtain the specified measurement result.\n\n<<<C>>>"
