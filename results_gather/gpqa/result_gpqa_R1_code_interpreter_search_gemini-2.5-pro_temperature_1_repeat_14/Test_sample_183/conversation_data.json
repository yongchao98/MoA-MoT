    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The substituents are all adjacent to each other. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming substituents is crucial for planning the synthesis.\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)**: A strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)**: A moderately activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which often favors substitution at the para position over the ortho position due to steric hindrance.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: A strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically assembles these groups in the correct 1,2,3-pattern. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that major products of reactions are used, and that challenging reactions (like those on heavily deactivated rings) are avoided unless necessary. The 1,2,3-pattern often requires a special strategy, such as the use of a \"blocking group\" that is later removed. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n*   Step (i) gives nitrobenzene.\n*   Step (ii) gives aniline.\n*   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic nitrogen atom of the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B and C: Both start with i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   Step (i) produces tert-butylbenzene.\n*   Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution. The major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (1-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), with the ortho isomer being a minor product.\n*   A high-yield synthesis must utilize the major product. Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it impossible to achieve the desired 1,2,3-pattern in subsequent steps. Any further substitution on 1-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene or its derivatives will occur at positions 2 or 6 (relative to the nitro group), leading to 1,2,4- or 1,2,4,6- patterns. Therefore, any sequence starting with nitration of tert-butylbenzene is unlikely to be correct for a high-yield synthesis of this specific isomer. Thus, **Options B and C are incorrect.**\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis option employs the blocking group strategy, which is the most promising approach for this target. Let's trace the steps:\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene**: A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Sulfonation. The para position is blocked by the bulky tert-butyl group, but sulfonation is reversible. Under thermodynamic control (higher temperature), the para isomer is favored. This step strategically blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (and 6). This step successfully places a nitro group ortho to the eventual position of the ethoxy group.\n*   **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. This amino group will eventually be converted into the ethoxy group.\n*   **v) ... + NaNO2/HCl → 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt**: Diazotization of the amino group.\n*   **vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-diazonium-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt**: This is the second nitration. This step is unusual, as diazonium salts are highly reactive. However, let's analyze the directing effects. The -N2+ group is a powerful m-director, -SO3H is a m-director, and -tBu is an o,p-director. The -SO3H and -tBu groups both direct an incoming electrophile to position 3. This directs the second nitro group to the correct final position.\n*   **vii) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group upon heating in aqueous acid.\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H2SO4 → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: Desulfonation. The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating in dilute acid, revealing the desired phenol precursor. (The numbering changes as -OH gets priority 1).\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenoxide (formed with NaOH) reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ethoxy ether product.\n\nThis sequence, although containing an uncommon step (nitration of a diazonium salt), is chemically sound and logically constructs the complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The other options have more fundamental flaws.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Option A describes a plausible, albeit advanced, synthetic route that correctly uses a blocking group strategy to achieve the high-yield synthesis of the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
