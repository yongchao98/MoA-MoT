    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Its fundamental formula is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n### 2. Analyze λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules\n\n*   **Particles Involved:** This involves a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The density of target gas molecules is `n`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1):** When considering collisions between identical molecules moving with thermal velocities, the kinetic theory of gases introduces a correction factor of `sqrt(2)` to account for the relative motion. The cross-section itself is related to the physical size of the molecules. Let's call the molecule-molecule kinetic cross-section `σ_gg` (often approximated as `πd²`, where `d` is the molecular diameter).\n*   **Formula for λ1:**\n    λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)\n\n### 3. Analyze λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons\n\n*   **Particles Involved:** This involves a high-energy electron from the beam colliding with stationary gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The density of the target gas molecules is the same `n`, as the gas conditions in the chamber haven't changed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** This is the cross-section for a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule (`σ_eg`). The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (1000 kV is a relativistic energy), while the gas molecules are essentially stationary in comparison. Therefore, the `sqrt(2)` factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:**\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n### 4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n\n*   **Molecule-Molecule Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is determined by the physical size of the molecules. For a typical gas molecule like N₂, the diameter is a few Angstroms (e.g., ~3.6 x 10⁻¹⁰ m), leading to a cross-section on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n*   **Electron-Molecule Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This describes the interaction of a tiny, point-like electron with the electromagnetic field of a molecule. For a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron, the interaction is very brief as it speeds past the molecule. In high-energy physics, it's a general principle that scattering cross-sections decrease as the energy of the projectile particle increases. The gas molecule becomes more \"transparent\" to the highly energetic electron. Therefore, the effective target area presented by the molecule to the fast electron is much smaller than its physical size presented to another, slower molecule.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    σ_eg << σ_gg\n\n### 5. Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2)\n\nNow we can compare λ1 and λ2 using their formulas. Let's look at their ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\nλ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nSince we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a large number (much greater than 1).\nTherefore:\nλ2 / λ1 >> sqrt(2)\nSince `sqrt(2)` is approximately 1.414, we can definitively conclude that:\nλ2 / λ1 > 1.414\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's check which option matches our conclusion `λ2 / λ1 > 1.414`.\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This implies λ2/λ1 is between 1 and 1.22, which contradicts our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. This is the only option consistent with the conclusion that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (and specifically, greater than 1.414 * λ1).\n\nThe electrons, being very fast and small, are much less likely to collide with the residual gas molecules than the gas molecules are with each other. This results in a much longer mean free path for the electrons.\n\n<<<D>>>"
