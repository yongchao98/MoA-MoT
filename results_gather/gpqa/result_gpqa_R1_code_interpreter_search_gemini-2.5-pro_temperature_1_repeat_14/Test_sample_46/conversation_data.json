    "**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, and N = number of nitrogens.\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is highly indicative of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (above 3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester**, specifically one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from a typical aliphatic ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal step-by-step:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a group with n=2 protons, i.e., a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methylene group is adjacent to a group with n=3 protons, i.e., a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significantly downfield shift for a methylene group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen.\n    *   **Conclusion from 1.20 and 4.5 ppm signals:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together form the signature pattern of an **ethoxy group attached to the ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.0 ppm) and Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the two protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. Amine protons are often broad due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (total 4H):** Four protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), confirming the presence of a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons are split into two groups. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group. The -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group (shields protons), and the ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group (deshields protons). This pattern fits perfectly.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n*   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nCombining these pieces, we have an ethyl ester of a benzoic acid with an amino group at the para (4) position. The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verifying the Choice**\n\nLet's re-examine the correct option:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂ - Correct.\n    *   IR: Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester C=O. - Correct.\n    *   ¹H NMR: Has a para-substituted ring, an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, and an -NH₂ group. All chemical shifts and multiplicities match the data. - Correct.\n\nThis compound, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
