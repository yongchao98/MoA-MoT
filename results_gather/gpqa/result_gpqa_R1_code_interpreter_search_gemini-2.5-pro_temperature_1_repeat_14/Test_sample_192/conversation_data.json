    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We are given how the number of stars per unit parallax, let's call it `N(plx)`, varies with parallax (`plx`). We need to find out how the number of stars per unit distance, let's call it `N(r)`, varies with distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationship:** The fundamental relationship connecting parallax and distance is that they are inversely proportional.\n    *   `plx = 1/r`\n    *   where `r` is the distance to the star and `plx` is its parallax angle.\n\n3.  **State the Given Information:** The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars found in a small interval of parallax `d(plx)` is proportional to `(1/plx^5) d(plx)`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    *   `N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n4.  **Set up the Transformation:** We want to transform the distribution from being a function of parallax to being a function of distance. The number of stars in a specific population is constant, regardless of whether we count them using parallax or distance. This means the number of stars in a small parallax range `d(plx)` must equal the number of stars in the corresponding distance range `dr`.\n    *   Number of stars in parallax range `d(plx)` is `N(plx) * |d(plx)|`\n    *   Number of stars in distance range `dr` is `N(r) * |dr|`\n    *   Therefore, `N(r) * |dr| = N(plx) * |d(plx)|`\n    *   This gives us the relationship for the number density: `N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    *   The absolute value is used because both `dr` and `d(plx)` represent small, positive intervals.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:** We need to find the term `d(plx)/dr`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   `plx = r^-1`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation: `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r^-2 = -1/r^2`\n    *   The absolute value is: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute everything back into our transformation equation:\n    *   `N(r) ∝ N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    *   We know `N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` and `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   `N(r) ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:** The final step is to replace the `plx` term with its equivalent in `r`.\n    *   Since `plx = 1/r`, we have `plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5`.\n    *   Therefore, `1/plx^5 = 1 / (1/r^5) = r^5`.\n    *   Substitute this back into the proportionality for `N(r)`:\n    *   `N(r) ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   `N(r) ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    *   `N(r) ∝ r^3`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) is proportional to `r^3`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
