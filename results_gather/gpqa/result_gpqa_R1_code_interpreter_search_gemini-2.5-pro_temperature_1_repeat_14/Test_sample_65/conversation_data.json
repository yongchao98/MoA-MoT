    "This is a question about the fundamental principles underlying the construction of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Let's break down each of the proposed symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The SMEFT is constructed as a relativistic quantum field theory. A core assumption is that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. This is the principle of Lorentz invariance. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry:** This is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, which includes Lorentz transformations (item 1) plus spacetime translations. Since the SMEFT is a local quantum field theory defined on a flat Minkowski spacetime, it is also invariant under translations. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry, which encompasses both, must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model (SM) itself violates CP symmetry, for example, through a complex phase in the CKM matrix of the weak interaction. The SMEFT is an extension of the SM that includes higher-dimensional operators representing new physics. These new operators can, and often do, introduce new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). The CPT Theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined CPT transformation. Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Breaking CPT would require a much more drastic modification of the fundamental principles of physics than what is assumed in SMEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). They do not necessarily need to respect CP symmetry (3).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of symmetries is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
