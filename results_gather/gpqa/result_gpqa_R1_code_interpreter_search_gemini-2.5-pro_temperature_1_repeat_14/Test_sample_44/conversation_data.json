    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the three lowest states (ground state, first excited state, and second excited state) for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the quantized energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere n is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThus, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state for this system is defined by the pair of quantum numbers (n, $m_s$), where n is the energy level and $m_s$ is the spin quantum number ($m_s = +1/2$ or $-1/2$).\n\nThis implies that each energy level 'n' can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up ($m_s = +1/2$) and one with spin down ($m_s = -1/2$).\n\n### 3. Calculating the State Energies\n\nWe will find the total energy of the system by filling the single-particle energy levels with the four particles, starting from the lowest energy configuration (ground state) and then considering excitations to higher energy states.\n\n#### Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$):** We place the remaining two particles in this level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### First Excited State Energy ($E_{first}$)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The ground state configuration is: two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   The first excited state configuration is:\n    *   Two particles in **n=1** (Energy = $2 \\times 1E = 2E$)\n    *   One particle in **n=2** (Energy = $1 \\times 4E = 4E$)\n    *   One particle in **n=3** (Energy $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy ($E_{second}$)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state. Let's list the possibilities and their energies:\n\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3 (leaving n=2 full).\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{second} = 18E$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the result.\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the single-particle energy function in terms of E\ndef energy_level(n):\n    return n*n\n\n# Since particles are fermions, each energy level n can hold two particles (spin up, spin down).\n# We can create a list of all possible single-particle states with their energies.\n# Let's consider states up to n=6.\n# Each state is represented by its energy.\n# The list represents the set of available states { (n=1, up), (n=1, down), (n=2, up), (n=2, down), ... }\n# The energies are { E_1, E_1, E_2, E_2, ... }\nparticle_state_energies = []\nfor n in range(1, 7):\n    # Add two states for each energy level n\n    particle_state_energies.append(energy_level(n))\n    particle_state_energies.append(energy_level(n))\n\n# To find the total energy of the 4-particle system, we must choose 4 distinct states\n# from the list above, which is equivalent to choosing 4 indices.\nnum_particles = 4\nstate_indices = range(len(particle_state_energies))\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 4 distinct states\nenergy_combinations = combinations(state_indices, num_particles)\n\n# Calculate the total energy for each combination and store unique values\ntotal_system_energies = set()\nfor combo in energy_combinations:\n    total_energy = sum(particle_state_energies[i] for i in combo)\n    total_system_energies.add(total_energy)\n\n# Sort the unique energies to find the lowest ones\nsorted_energies = sorted(list(total_system_energies))\n\n# The first three are the ground, first excited, and second excited states\nground_state_energy = sorted_energies[0]\nfirst_excited_state_energy = sorted_energies[1]\nsecond_excited_state_energy = sorted_energies[2]\n\nprint(f\"Ground State Energy: {ground_state_energy}E\")\nprint(f\"First Excited State Energy: {first_excited_state_energy}E\")\nprint(f\"Second Excited State Energy: {second_excited_state_energy}E\")\n```\n>>>\nGround State Energy: 10E\nFirst Excited State Energy: 15E\nSecond Excited State Energy: 18E\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energies for the system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by the formula:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of `E`:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nSo, the first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. The Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are described as \"identical spin-1/2 particles,\" which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\nIn this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number $m_s$ (which can be +1/2 for \"spin up\" or -1/2 for \"spin down\"). This means that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System's Total Energy\n\nWe will now determine the total energy for the ground state and the first two excited states by filling the energy levels with the four particles according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n#### Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy = 1E):** We place the first two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = \\textbf{10E}$\n\n#### First Excited State Energy ($E_{first}$)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2 in the ground state) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The ground state configuration is: (2 particles in n=1), (2 particles in n=2).\n*   The first excited state configuration is obtained by moving one particle from n=2 to n=3:\n    *   Two particles in **n=1** (Energy = $2 \\times 1E = 2E$)\n    *   One particle in **n=2** (Energy = $1 \\times 4E = 4E$)\n    *   One particle in **n=3** (Energy = $1 \\times 9E = 9E$)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\textbf{15E}$\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy ($E_{second}$)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n\n*   **Possibility 1: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: (1 particle in n=1), (2 particles in n=2), (1 particle in n=3).\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\textbf{18E}$.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: (2 particles in n=1), (2 particles in n=3).\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility 3: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: (2 particles in n=1), (1 particle in n=2), (1 particle in n=4).\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the first excited state is 15E, and the second lowest energy of excitation is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{second} = \\textbf{18E}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
