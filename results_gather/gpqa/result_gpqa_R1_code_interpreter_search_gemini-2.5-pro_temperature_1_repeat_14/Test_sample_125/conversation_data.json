    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new chiral center (R or S). Since there is already a chiral center in the molecule, the two products formed will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketones react. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (they are superimposable). So, there is only one meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The mixture contains the five stereoisomers produced in both reactions.\n    *   Products from Rxn I: (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Products from Rxn II: The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they will elute together as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different (different molecular weight, functional groups, and polarity). It is certain they will not co-elute (i.e., elute at the same time).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers).\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The mixture contains five stereochemically distinct compounds.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since a chiral column can resolve all five distinct stereoisomers, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
