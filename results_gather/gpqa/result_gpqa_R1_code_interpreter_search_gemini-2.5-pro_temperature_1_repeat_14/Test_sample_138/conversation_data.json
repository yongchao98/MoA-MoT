    "This problem requires us to identify the starting materials A and B that, upon treatment with sodium nitrite (NaNO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water (H2O), yield specific α-diketones. The reaction conditions (NaNO2, HCl) are characteristic of the nitrosation of an active methylene or methine group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This reaction is a standard method for preparing α-dicarbonyl compounds from ketones.\n\n### Reaction Mechanism\n\nThe overall transformation is the oxidation of a CH₂ group alpha (α) to a carbonyl group (C=O) into a new carbonyl group. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Formation of the Nitrosating Agent**: Sodium nitrite reacts with hydrochloric acid to form nitrous acid (HONO), which in the presence of strong acid, can generate the nitrosonium ion (NO⁺), the active electrophile.\n    `NaNO2 + HCl → HONO + NaCl`\n    `HONO + H⁺ ⇌ H₂O + NO⁺`\n2.  **Enolization**: The starting ketone, in the presence of acid, forms its enol tautomer.\n3.  **Electrophilic Attack**: The electron-rich double bond of the enol attacks the electrophilic nitrosonium ion (NO⁺). This adds a nitroso group (-NO) to the α-carbon.\n4.  **Tautomerization**: The resulting α-nitroso ketone is unstable and tautomerizes to the more stable α-oximino ketone (a monoxime of the target diketone).\n5.  **Hydrolysis**: The oxime is then hydrolyzed under acidic conditions (using the HCl and H₂O present in the reaction mixture) to yield the α-diketone and hydroxylamine (as its hydrochloride salt).\n\nThis process effectively converts an α-CH₂ group into a C=O group.\n`R-CO-CH₂-R'  →  R-CO-CO-R'`\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the two specific reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: A → 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione\n\n*   **Product**: 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is an α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 2 of a cyclohexane ring, which has an isopropyl group at position 4.\n*   **Starting Material (A)**: To form this 1,2-diketone, we need to start with a ketone that has the same carbon skeleton and a carbonyl group at either position 1 or 2. The reaction will then introduce the second carbonyl group on the adjacent carbon.\n*   The most logical precursor is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**. In this molecule, the carbonyl group is at C1. The α-carbons are C2 and C6. These positions are equivalent. The reaction will oxidize one of these α-methylene groups (e.g., C2) to a carbonyl group, yielding the desired product, 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n\nLooking at the options provided, choices C and D propose 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one as starting material A. This supports our analysis.\n\n### Reaction 2: B → 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione\n\n*   **Product**: 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This is an acyclic α-diketone with carbonyl groups at C2 and C3 of a hexane chain that is substituted with a methyl group at C5.\n*   **Starting Material (B)**: To form this 2,3-diketone, the starting material must be a ketone with the same carbon skeleton. The starting ketone could be 5-methylhexan-2-one or 5-methylhexan-3-one.\n    *   If we start with **5-methylhexan-2-one**, the carbonyl is at C2. The α-positions are C1 (a -CH₃ group) and C3 (a -CH₂ group). The reaction generally proceeds faster at a methylene (-CH₂-) group than at a methyl (-CH₃) group because the enolate leading to reaction at C3 is more substituted (thermodynamically more stable). Therefore, oxidation will selectively occur at C3 to form **5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**.\n    *   If we start with 5-methylhexan-3-one, the carbonyl is at C3. The α-positions are C2 and C4, both of which are methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Oxidation could occur at either position, potentially leading to a mixture of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione and 5-methylhexane-3,4-dione. While the desired product could be formed, the reaction is less specific.\n*   Given that the reaction produces 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione, **5-methylhexan-2-one** is the more logical and efficient starting material.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nNow we combine our findings for A and B:\n*   **A** should be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **B** should be 5-methylhexan-2-one.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol. Incorrect. These reagents do not convert an ether-alcohol or a diol to a diketone.\n*   B) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one. Incorrect starting material for A.\n*   **C) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one.** This option matches our deductions for both A and B.\n*   D) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol. Incorrect starting material for B. A diol is not oxidized by NaNO₂/HCl.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair of starting materials is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
