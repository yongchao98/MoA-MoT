    "This problem requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer upon electrophilic bromination. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their effect on the reaction rate (activating/deactivating) and the position of substitution (ortho/para-directing or meta-directing).\n\n*   **Group 1: Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl)\n\n*   **Group 2: Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density via the inductive effect (deactivating) but donate electron density via resonance, directing incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro)\n\n*   **Group 3: Deactivating, Meta-directing:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. The yield of ortho and para isomers is very low.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl carboxylate)\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Order the substances based on their directing group.**\nThe compounds with meta-directing groups will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The compounds with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order will start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho-, para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directing compounds (2, 4, 6).**\nThese compounds primarily yield the meta-isomer, but trace amounts of ortho and para isomers are also formed. We need to rank them by the increasing (but very small) yield of the para-isomer. The amount of para product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group.\n\nThe deactivating strength order is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\nThis means `-NO2` will direct most strongly to the meta position, leaving the least amount for the para position. `-COOC2H5` is the weakest deactivator in this group, so it will allow for a slightly higher (yet still small) fraction of the para-isomer.\n\nApproximate para-isomer yields during bromination are:\n*   4) Nitrobenzene (`-NO2`): ~0.1% para.\n*   6) Benzoic acid (`-COOH`): ~1-2% para.\n*   2) Ethyl benzoate (`-COOC2H5`): ~3% para.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho-, para-directing compounds (1, 3, 5).**\nFor these compounds, the main products are the ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them (para/ortho ratio) is largely determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder the ortho positions more, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups (1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to yield a higher percentage of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   Para yield for Toluene (1): ~67%\n    *   Para yield for Ethylbenzene (5): >67% (The increased bulk favors the para position)\n    *   Therefore, the order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with the halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is deactivating overall but is strongly para-directing due to a combination of inductive and resonance effects. Halobenzenes are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions.\n    *   Para yield for Chlorobenzene (3): ~89%\n\n*   **Combining the ortho-, para-directors:** Comparing the yields: Toluene (~67%) < Ethylbenzene (>67%) < Chlorobenzene (~89%).\n    *   The order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine all substances into a single order.**\nFirst, we list the meta-directing group in their established order, followed by the ortho-, para-directing group in their order.\n\n*   Meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho-, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining these gives the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
