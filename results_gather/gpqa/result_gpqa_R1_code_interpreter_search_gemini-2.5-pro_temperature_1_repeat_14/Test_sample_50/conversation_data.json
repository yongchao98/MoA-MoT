    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and the Method of Images\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition. The electric field outside the sphere is complex due to this induced charge distribution.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve such problems. It simplifies the problem by replacing the sphere and its induced charges with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere's original volume. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is V=0 on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `z = d`. We place the image charge `q'` at `z = b` along the same axis.\n\nThe potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere (a point at radius `R`) must be zero. The potential is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\n`V(surface) = k*q/r₁ + k*q'/r₂ = 0`\nwhere `r₁` is the distance from `q` to the point on the surface and `r₂` is the distance from `q'` to the point on the surface.\n\nBy solving this equation for all points on the sphere, we find the unique values for the image charge `q'` and its position `b`:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R² / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of `q` and the grounded sphere is equivalent, for all points outside the sphere, to a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at `z=d` and `q' = -qR/d` at `z=R²/d`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy (U)\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As we bring `q` in, it induces charges on the sphere, and there's a force between `q` and these induced charges.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\n\nThe force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge `q' = -qR/x` at `b = R²/x`.\nThe distance between the charge and its image is `x - b = x - R²/x`.\nThe force is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work done by this electric force as the charge moves from infinity to `d`:\n`U = -W = - ∫[infinity to d] F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫[infinity to d] (-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²) dx = k * q² * R * ∫[infinity to d] (x / (x² - R²)²) dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution with `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ (x / (x² - R²)²) dx = ∫ (1/u²) (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ]` from infinity to `d`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) - 0 ]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n#### Method B: Using Potential `U = (1/2)qV`\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ qᵢVᵢ`, where `Vᵢ` is the potential at the location of charge `qᵢ` due to all *other* charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * ∫ V_sphere * d(q_induced)`\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0, so the second term is zero.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\nThe potential from the image charge `q'` at the location of `q` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\nDistance = `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n`q' = -qR/d`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d) = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d² - R²) ]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R²)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) (Incorrect, wrong denominator and numerator)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) (Correct)\n\nThe correct expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
