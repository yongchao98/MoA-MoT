    "1.  **Analyze the C3h symmetry group:** A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess two key symmetry elements:\n    *   A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is indistinguishable after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n    *   A **σh mirror plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    The presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the presence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The C3h point group consists of the operations {E, C3, C3^2, σh, S3, S3^5}. A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses at least a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure and symmetry of each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a large, fused aromatic core (triphenylene) with three anhydride-like groups attached.\n        *   **Symmetry:** Due to severe steric hindrance between the fused rings, the molecule is forced into a non-planar, propeller-like shape. This twisted structure has a C3 axis passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its average plane. However, because it is twisted and chiral (like a propeller), it cannot have a mirror plane (σh). A reflection would convert the molecule into its mirror image (enantiomer).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This molecule belongs to the **C3** point group. It has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane. Thus, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the IUPAC name for **mellitic trianhydride** (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three five-membered anhydride rings.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The entire molecule is **planar**.\n            *   It has a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n            *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**.\n        *   The molecule also possesses other symmetry elements (three C2 axes in the plane and three vertical mirror planes, σv), which places it in the **D3h** point group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule has both a C3 axis and a σh plane, it fulfills the requirements for C3h symmetry. The D3h point group is a supergroup of C3h, meaning it contains all the symmetry elements of C3h.\n\n    *   **C) triisopropyl borate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups, B(O-iPr)3.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The B and three O atoms are nearly coplanar. To minimize steric repulsion, the three isopropyl groups [-CH(CH3)2] twist in a concerted, propeller-like fashion. This conformation gives the molecule a **C3 axis** passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, like any propeller, this structure is chiral and lacks a mirror plane (σh).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The molecule belongs to the **C3** point group. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) with a cage-like structure.\n        *   **Symmetry:** It has a **C3 axis** that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group. It has a C3 axis, but it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n3.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   Molecule A: C3 symmetry (No σh)\n    *   Molecule B: D3h symmetry (Has C3 and σh)\n    *   Molecule C: C3 symmetry (No σh)\n    *   Molecule D: C3v symmetry (No σh)\n\nOnly molecule B possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane. Therefore, it is the only one with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
