    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that we should introduce the substituents in an order that utilizes *meta*-directing effects.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction introduces the acetyl group, forming acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *Product: Acetophenone*\n\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination):** The acetyl group on the ring directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position.\n    *Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone*\n\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH₃ (at C1) and -Br (at C3). We need to determine where the nitro group will go.\n    *   The -COCH₃ group is a strong deactivator and directs *meta* (to C5).\n    *   The -Br group is a weak deactivator and directs *ortho, para* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   The acetyl group strongly deactivates its ortho and para positions (C2, C4, C6). The bromine atom also deactivates the ring but directs incoming groups to these same positions. The position least deactivated is C5, which is meta to both existing substituents. Therefore, the powerful meta-directing and deactivating acetyl group will primarily direct the incoming nitro group to position C5.\n    *Product: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.* This is the target molecule.\n\nThe first three steps of this sequence successfully synthesize the desired product with high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical for this synthesis and appear to be extraneous. However, the initial part of the sequence is the most logical and correct pathway among all choices.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Nitration:** Forms nitrobenzene (-NO₂ is a *meta*-director).\n*   **Step ii) Reduction:** Forms aniline (-NH₂ is an *ortho, para*-director).\n*   **Step iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on anilines because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivated anilinium complex. This path is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n\n*   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence is Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene. These steps form a futile cycle, returning to the starting material (benzene) before any of the target substituents are correctly placed. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Bromination:** Forms bromobenzene (-Br is an *ortho, para*-director).\n*   **Step ii) Nitration:** The -Br group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to the *ortho* and *para* positions. This produces a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. It does not produce the required 1-bromo-3-nitro- substitution pattern needed for the final product. This path is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence A provides a chemically sound and logical pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, specifically in its first three steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or chemically incompatible reactions. Despite the presence of superfluous and incorrect later steps, Option A is the only choice containing the correct synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>"
