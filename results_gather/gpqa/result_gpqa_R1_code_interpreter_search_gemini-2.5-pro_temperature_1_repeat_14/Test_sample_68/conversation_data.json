    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle $X^0$ that decays. We are given its proper lifetime, its rest mass, and its total energy in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber). We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays.\n\n-   **Relativistic Motion:** Since the particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), the particle is moving at a speed close to the speed of light. We must use the principles of special relativity.\n-   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation. The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n-   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability of a single particle surviving for a time $t$ in the lab frame is $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n-   **Decay Length:** The particle travels a certain distance before decaying. The average distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is called the mean decay length, $\\lambda$. It is given by $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n-   **Observing Decays:** A detector can only \"observe\" a decay if it can distinguish the decay point from the production point. This means the particle must travel a distance $d$ greater than the detector's spatial resolution, which we'll call $d_{res}$.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Mathematical Condition\nWe want to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the fraction of particles that travel a distance $d$ greater than our resolution $d_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\n\nThe number of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance $x$ is given by $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length. This is also the number of particles that travel a distance greater than $x$.\n\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ is:\n$F(d > d_{res}) = \\frac{N(d_{res})}{N_0} = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\nWe require this fraction to be at least 30% (or 0.30):\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\geq 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum (i.e., best) resolution that meets this requirement, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n\nSolving for the resolution $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Necessary Quantities\nTo find $d_{res}$, we first need to calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$.\n\n**a) Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy $E$ to the rest mass energy $m_0c^2$.\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2}$\nGiven the energies in GeV, we have:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n**b) Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is $\\lambda = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$. We can express this in a more convenient form.\nThe relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m_0 v$, so $v = p/(\\gamma m_0)$.\n$\\lambda = \\frac{p}{\\gamma m_0} (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\frac{p \\tau_0}{m_0}$\nThe momentum can be found from the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\nSo, $p = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{c}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{c} \\frac{\\tau_0}{m_0} = \\frac{\\tau_0 c}{m_0 c^2} \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\nThis can be simplified using $\\gamma$:\n$\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n**c) Perform the Calculation**\nNow, we'll substitute the given values into the formulas. A Python script is ideal for this to maintain precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # proper lifetime in s\nE = 27.0        # total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41       # rest mass in GeV/c^2\nc = 299792458.0 # speed of light in m/s\nfraction = 0.30\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length lambda\n# lambda = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nlmbda = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution d_res\n# d_res = -lambda * ln(fraction)\nd_res = -lmbda * math.log(fraction)\n\nprint(f\"{d_res:.2e} m\")\n```\nThe execution of this code yields:\n```\n2.27e-06 m\n```\nThis result, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to option A. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the constants used in the options. Let's re-calculate using the value from option A to verify consistency. If the resolution is $d = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the fraction of observed decays would be $e^{-d/\\lambda} = e^{-2.08 \\times 10^{-6} / (1.885 \\times 10^{-6})} \\approx e^{-1.10} \\approx 0.33$, which is \"at least 30%\".\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe required minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This corresponds to the choice:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a particle $X^0$ decaying in a bubble chamber.\n    *   The particle is relativistic, as its total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV).\n    *   We are given the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s), which is the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   We need to find the minimum spatial resolution of the detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Concepts:**\n    *   **Time Dilation:** Due to its high speed, the particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The relationship is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy: $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$.\n    *   **Decay Length:** In the laboratory frame, the particle travels a certain distance before it decays. The *mean decay length* ($\\lambda$) is the average distance traveled before decay. It is calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Condition for Observation:**\n    *   A decay is \"observed\" if the track left by the particle is long enough to be resolved by the detector. This means the distance the particle travels before decaying, $d$, must be greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$.\n    *   The decay of particles is a random process following an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(d > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n    *   We require that at least 30% of the decays are observed. This means the fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than the resolution $d_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\n    *   So, the mathematical condition is: $P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\geq 0.30$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Resolution:**\n    *   To find the required resolution, we solve the boundary condition: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: $-\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n    *   This equation gives the *maximum* resolution that will allow observing at least 30% of the decays. Any resolution *smaller* than this value will observe an even greater fraction. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which in this context means the limiting value.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Quantities:**\n    *   First, we calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$.\n    *   Second, we calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$. A useful formula for the decay length that combines the steps is $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   Finally, we use the value of $\\lambda$ to calculate $d_{res}$.\n\n6.  **Computation using Python:**\n    We can use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n    *   **Inputs:**\n        *   `tau0` = $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   `E` = 27 GeV\n        *   `m0` = 3.41 GeV (Note: mass is given in units of GeV/$c^2$, so $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV)\n        *   `c` (speed of light) $\\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Calculate $\\gamma = E/m_0$.\n        2.  Calculate $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n        3.  Calculate $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$.\n\nThis leads to the following Python code:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given physical constants and values\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27.0        # total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41       # rest mass in GeV/c^2\nc = 299792458.0 # speed of light in m/s\n\n# The fraction of decays to be observed\nfraction_to_observe = 0.30\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# Since E and m0 are given in the same energy units (GeV), we can take their ratio directly.\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame.\n# The formula is lambda = v * tau = v * gamma * tau0.\n# A more direct formula is lambda = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution (d_res).\n# The condition is exp(-d_res / lambda) >= fraction.\n# We solve for the boundary case: exp(-d_res / lambda) = fraction\n# -d_res / lambda = ln(fraction)\n# d_res = -lambda * ln(fraction)\nresolution = -mean_decay_length * math.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\n# Print the final result in meters\nprint(f\"{resolution:.2e}\")\n```\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nExecuting the code gives a result of approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value represents the maximum allowable resolution (the coarsest detector) that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. Any detector with a resolution value smaller than this will also satisfy the condition.\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\n*   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n*   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n*   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nOur calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is numerically closest to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to rounding of the initial values provided in the problem statement. In multiple-choice physics problems, the correct choice is the one that is closest to the calculated theoretical value. Option A satisfies the condition ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\leq 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$) and is the closest to the boundary.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe core of the problem is to find the spatial resolution of a detector (the Bubble Chamber) required to observe a certain fraction of particle decays. \"Observing\" a decay means being able to distinguish the point where the particle was created from the point where it decayed. This implies that the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n### 2. Identify the Key Physical Principles\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle $X^0$ has a total energy ($E=27$ GeV) much larger than its rest mass ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), which means it is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. We must use relativistic equations.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will survive for a time $t$ (or travel a distance $d$) follows an exponential decay law.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Mathematical Condition\nLet $d_{res}$ be the spatial resolution of the detector. A decay is observed only if the particle travels a distance $d > d_{res}$ before decaying.\n\nThe number of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance $x$ in the lab frame is given by $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ is:\n$F(d > d_{res}) = \\frac{N(d_{res})}{N_0} = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given that at least 30% of the decays must be observed. This translates to the condition:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\geq 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum resolution needed (which corresponds to the maximum acceptable value for $d_{res}$), we solve the boundary condition:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n\nSolving for the resolution, $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nTo find $d_{res}$, we first need to calculate $\\lambda$.\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying: $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau$ is its lifetime in the lab.\n\n**a) Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy $E$ to the rest mass energy $m_0c^2$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\nUsing the given values (since both are in GeV, the units cancel):\n$\\gamma = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n**b) Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nWe know that $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nSo, $\\lambda = v \\tau = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$.\nA more direct and useful formula uses the fact that $\\beta \\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n$\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n### 5. Perform the Calculation\nWe have all the pieces to solve for $d_{res}$. We can use a Python script to perform the numerical calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27.0        # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41       # Rest mass in GeV/c^2 (so m0*c^2 = 3.41 GeV)\nc = 299792458.0 # Speed of light in m/s\nfraction_observed = 0.30\n\n# 1.

Calculate the required resolution, d_res.\n# The condition is e^(-d_res / lambda) = 0.30\n# This gives d_res = -lambda * ln(0.30)\nresolution = -mean_decay_length * math.log(fraction_observed)\n\n# Print the final result in meters, using scientific notation for clarity.\nprint(f\"{resolution:.2e}\")\n```\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe executed code gives a result of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is the maximum resolution that would allow observing at least 30% of the decays. We must choose an option that is less than or equal to this value.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe calculated value is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to this value and of the same order of magnitude. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. A resolution of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is better (smaller) than the calculated boundary of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, so it would indeed observe more than 30% of the decays, satisfying the condition. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a summary of the reasoning followed by the final answer.\n\n### Reasoning\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) required for a detector to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** Since the particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is significantly greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), the particle is highly relativistic. We must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n3.  **Decay Law:** The decay of particles follows an exponential law.

This is the maximum resolution that satisfies the condition. Any resolution smaller than this will also work.\n    *   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    *   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    *   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\n    Option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the only choice with the correct order of magnitude and is numerically very close to our calculated value.
