    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of light from a star. The formula for the non-relativistic Doppler shift is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\Delta \\lambda$ is the shift in wavelength, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the star, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The \"up to\" value of the periodic shift corresponds to the maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$. This occurs when the star is moving directly towards or away from us at its maximum speed. This maximum speed is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as $K$.\n    So, $K = v_{r,max}$.\n\n    From the Doppler formula, we have:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n    Since $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ (it's the same spectral line for both stars) are constants, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n    We are given:\n    $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ\n    $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude of the host star is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    where:\n    -   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    -   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    -   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    -   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n    -   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Information to Find the Relationship between K and P**\n    The problem states that:\n    -   The star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    -   The planet masses are the same ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).\n\n    Although the inclination angle $i$ is not given for either system, it is a standard assumption in such problems that either the systems are viewed under the same angle ($i_1 = i_2$) or that we are considering the maximum possible signal (edge-on view, $i = 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin i = 1$). In either case, the term $m_p \\sin i / M_{star}^{2/3}$ is a constant for both systems.\n\n    Therefore, the relationship between $K$ and $P$ simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can rearrange the equation by cubing both sides:\n    $\\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    And then taking the reciprocal:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3$\n\n    Now, we substitute the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes we found in step 1:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value**\n    To compare with the given options, we calculate the decimal value of the fraction.\n    $\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.\n# The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts dL1/dL2.\n# K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).\n# So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.\ndL1 = 5  # Wavelength shift for planet 1 in mÅ\ndL2 = 7  # Wavelength shift for planet 2 in mÅ\n\n# The ratio K1/K2 is dL1/dL2\nratio_K1_over_K2 = dL1 / dL2\n\n# The ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3\nratio_P2_over_P1 = ratio_K1_over_K2 ** 3\n\nprint(ratio_P2_over_P1)\n```\n\n>>>0.3644314868804665\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis means that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$).\n\nTherefore, we have the following relationships:\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\nand\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n\nCombining these equations, we get:\n\n$(\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2})^3$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n$\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>"
