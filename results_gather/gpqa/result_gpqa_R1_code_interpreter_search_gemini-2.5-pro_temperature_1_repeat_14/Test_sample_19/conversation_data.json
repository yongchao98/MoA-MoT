    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each statement.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation (IA)**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus happens so quickly that it can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. The \"impulse\" delivered to the nucleon is so large and rapid that the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the effects of the nuclear potential *during* the interaction.\n\nLet's analyze the given statements based on this understanding:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the foundational principle of the IA. The total interaction operator for the nucleus is assumed to be a sum of operators for the individual nucleons. This explicitly excludes interactions with the nucleus as a whole or with multi-nucleon systems (like meson-exchange currents). This statement is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This refers to what are known as initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI). For the simple impulse approximation to hold (specifically, the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA), we must assume that the incoming probe reaches the target nucleon without being distorted by the other nucleons, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) leave the nucleus without further interaction. In other words, the rest of the nuclear medium is \"transparent\". This statement is also a key part of the approximation in its simplest form.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is a framework for describing the interaction at the *nucleon* level within a *nucleus*. It is largely independent of the model used for the nucleon's internal structure. For example, the impulse approximation is used in deep inelastic scattering, where the quarks are treated as highly relativistic partons. Therefore, assuming non-relativistic quarks is *not* a general requirement for the impulse approximation. This statement is not a core part of the definition.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. The interaction time is assumed to be much shorter than the characteristic time for a nucleon to move within the nucleus. Because of this, the potential energy due to binding forces is considered negligible compared to the large energy transferred in the collision. The nucleon is treated as a free particle (with a momentum given by its instantaneous momentum inside the nucleus) at the moment of interaction. This statement is essential.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), the binding forces are negligible during the brief interaction (4), and the surrounding nuclear medium does not interfere with the particles before or after the collision (2).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
