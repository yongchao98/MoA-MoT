    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Identify the System and Energy Eigenvalues**\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system can be found by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The solution is well-known and the energy levels are quantized, given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$).\n\n**2. Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State**\nThe energy levels are ordered by the quantum number $n$.\n*   The ground state corresponds to $n=0$.\n*   The first excited state corresponds to $n=1$.\n*   The second excited state corresponds to $n=2$.\n*   The third excited state corresponds to $n=3$.\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we substitute $n=3$ into the energy formula:\n$E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n\n**3. Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states that have the same energy. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th energy level is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. We can calculate its degeneracy:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy eigenvalue is equal to the degeneracy of that energy level. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\nWe have found that the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10. Let's check the given options:\nA) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10 - Incorrect energy value.\nB) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\nC) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy.\nD) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
