    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The key assumption is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the ratio of atoms in different energy states.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_i):\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in the respective energy levels.\n    *   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** Let's apply this equation to the specific energy levels of iron atoms in star_1 and star_2. Let's denote the excited state by 'e' and the ground state by 'g'. The \"excitation\" is the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state (N_e / N_g).\n\n    *   For star_1 (with temperature T_1):\n        (N_e / N_g)_1 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\n    *   For star_2 (with temperature T_2):\n        (N_e / N_g)_2 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    Since we are considering the same energy levels for the same atom (iron), the statistical weights (g_e, g_g) and the energy difference (ΔE) are identical for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the Information Given in the Problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This translates to:\n\n    (N_e / N_g)_1 = 2 * (N_e / N_g)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n    (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    The term (g_e / g_g) is on both sides, so we can cancel it out:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperatures:** To solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x, we get:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ] = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the brackets:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Substitute the Numerical Values:** The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. We know the Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    Let's calculate the value of the term (ΔE / k):\n\n    (ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    The problem was designed so this term simplifies to 1.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into our derived equation:\n\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
