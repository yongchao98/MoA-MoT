    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   I have a system of five exoplanets (Planet_1 to Planet_5).\n    *   They are in circular orbits around the same star.\n    *   The orbital periods (P) are in a specific ratio: P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   All planets have the same albedo (A).\n    *   The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq) between Planet_4 and Planet_2, specifically T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Equations:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n        `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n        where:\n        *   `T_star` = Star's temperature\n        *   `A` = Planet's albedo\n        *   `R_star` = Star's radius\n        *   `a` = Planet's orbital semi-major axis (distance from the star for a circular orbit)\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star:\n        `P² ∝ a³` (The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis).\n\n3.  **Simplify the Relationships:**\n    *   Since all planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constants for all of them.\n    *   The problem states that the albedo `A` is the same for all planets.\n    *   Therefore, the terms `T_star`, `(1 - A)^(1/4)`, `R_star`, and the `sqrt(1/2)` part of the equilibrium temperature equation are all constant across the planets.\n    *   This simplifies the equilibrium temperature relationship to:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    *   I need to find a relationship between T_eq and the given information, which is the period (P).\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law (`P² ∝ a³`), I can express `a` in terms of `P`:\n        `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n    *   Now, I can substitute this into my simplified T_eq relationship:\n        `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\n        `T_eq ∝ P^(-2/6)`\n        `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n    *   This is the key relationship: The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    *   I need to find the ratio `T_eq4 / T_eq2`.\n    *   Using the proportionality `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`, I can write the ratio as:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄ / P₂)^(-1/3)`\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Insert the Given Values:**\n    *   From the ratio `P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`, I can take the relative values for `P₂` and `P₄`.\n    *   `P₂ = 2` (in relative units)\n    *   `P₄ = 3.5` (in relative units)\n    *   Now, I can plug these into my ratio formula:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Now I will use a calculator to compute the value. I can use a simple python script for this.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is equal to (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n# From the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n# So, the relative period for Planet 2 (P2) is 2.\n# And the relative period for Planet 4 (P4) is 3.5.\n\np2 = 2.0\np4 = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio\ntemperature_ratio = (p2 / p4)**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. The formula for the equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nSince all planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all planets. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is simplified to be proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a) or T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nWe can rearrange this to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship for 'a' into our simplified temperature equation:\n\nT_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\nT_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2):\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nSo, we can use the relative values P₂ = 2 and P₄ = 3.5.\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nThe Python code calculated this value:\n(2 / 3.5)**(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.69\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
