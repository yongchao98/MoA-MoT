    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves two steps applied to two different starting materials:\n1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This is a classic method for creating an epoxide from an alkene. The key stereochemical feature of this reaction is that it is a **syn addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (cis or trans) dictates the stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reaction opens the epoxide to form a diol (a compound with two hydroxyl groups). The key stereochemical feature here is that it is an **anti-addition**. The incoming nucleophile (H₂O) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the center that is attacked.\n\nThis two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product(s) of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a meso compound (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted, which it is).\n*   **Let's verify this step-by-step:**\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA (syn addition) → This forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this racemic mixture (anti-addition):\n        *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also gives (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Product Analysis:** The products are (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. A compound with two chiral centers bearing identical substituents is a meso compound if the configurations are opposite (R,S or S,R). Therefore, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a meso compound. The (4S,5R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product(s) of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted).\n*   **Let's verify this step-by-step:**\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA (syn addition) → This forms a cis-epoxide. Since the starting material is a symmetrical cis-alkene, the resulting epoxide is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry).\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide (anti-addition):\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Product Analysis:** The products are (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed in equal amounts from an achiral starting material, the product is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Two products are formed, which constitute a **racemic mixture of (4R,4R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different molecules (stereoisomers):\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these stereoisomers is:\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers**.\n*   (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3).\n\n**Step 5: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different polarity and will elute at a different time.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The **enantiomers** (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a different retention time and will appear as its own separate peak.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,4R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
