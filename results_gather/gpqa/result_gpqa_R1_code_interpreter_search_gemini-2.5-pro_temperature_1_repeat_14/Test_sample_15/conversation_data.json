    "A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key feature to look for is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer.\n    *   A specific stereoisomer is, by definition, a pure enantiomer or a diastereomer.\n    *   Unless the molecule is a meso compound (having chiral centers but being achiral overall due to internal symmetry), a single stereoisomer is chiral and optically active.\n    *   The complex, multi-ring structure with an `(E)-chloromethylene` (`=CHCl`) substituent makes it highly unlikely for the molecule to possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The `R` and `S` designations at the chiral centers (3a and 7a) confirm the presence of chirality. The specific configuration `(3aR,7aS)` combined with the `(E)` double bond represents a single chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   Let's examine the symmetry of the `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer. This particular combination of stereocenters creates a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall because it possesses an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   In the case of (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   Due to this center of inversion, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The stereochemistry is `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer, and they are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Since `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is a chiral molecule, a pure sample of it will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH= (C2), and -CH=CH-CH2- (C6).\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors `(1s,3s,5s)` indicate that all three -OH groups have the same relative stereochemistry (they are all on the same side of the ring, e.g., all *cis*).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents).\n    *   The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH-` group is bonded to one H, two identical methyl (-CH3) groups, and a `-CH2-` group. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other carbon atom in the molecule has four different substituents. The cyclopentyl ring is also symmetrically substituted.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>"
