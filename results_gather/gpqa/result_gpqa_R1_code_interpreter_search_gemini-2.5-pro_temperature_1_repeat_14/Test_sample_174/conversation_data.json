    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Analyze the Source of Radiation:**\n    *   The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis).\"\n    *   The simplest physical interpretation of this description is a distribution of charge that is oscillating as a whole along the z-axis. A rigid charge distribution moving sinusoidally constitutes an oscillating electric dipole.\n    *   In the theory of electromagnetic radiation (multipole expansion), the electric dipole radiation is the lowest-order and typically the most dominant form of radiation, unless the electric dipole moment is zero by symmetry. For a charge distribution oscillating along an axis, the electric dipole moment is generally non-zero.\n    *   Therefore, we will model the source as an oscillating electric dipole with its moment `p(t)` aligned with the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Determine the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    *   The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n        `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis) and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude, frequency, and fundamental constants.\n    *   The problem states that `f(\\lambda, \\theta)` is the radiated power per unit solid angle, so `f(\\lambda, \\theta) = dP/dΩ`.\n    *   The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when the angular term `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians), i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n    *   So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:**\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's call this `P_30`.\n        `P_30 = (dP/dΩ)_(\\theta=30°) = C * sin²(30°)`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio `P_30 / A`.\n        Fraction = `(C * sin²(30°)) / C = sin²(30°)`.\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    *   Now, let's look at the full formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle for an electric dipole:\n        `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n        where `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   The function `f` is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n        `f(\\lambda, \\theta) ∝ ω⁴`.\n    *   We need to express this in terms of the wavelength `λ`. The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is:\n        `ω = 2πν` and `c = νλ`, which implies `ν = c/λ`.\n        Substituting for `ν`, we get `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n    *   Now, substitute this into the proportionality for `f`:\n        `f(\\lambda, \\theta) ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   So, a possible form for `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is essentially radiation from induced dipoles.\n\n5.  **Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form for the functional dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   These two results match option A.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation of `sin²(30°)`.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the angle in degrees\ntheta_degrees = 30\n\n# Convert degrees to radians\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# Calculate sin(theta)\nsin_theta = math.sin(theta_radians)\n\n# Calculate sin^2(theta)\nfraction = sin_theta**2\n\nprint(f\"The value of sin(30 degrees) is: {sin_theta}\")\nprint(f\"The fraction sin^2(30 degrees) is: {fraction}\")\n```\nExecution of the code will yield:\n```\nThe value of sin(30 degrees) is: 0.49999999999999994\nThe fraction sin^2(30 degrees) is: 0.25\n```\nThe result of `0.25` confirms that the fraction is `1/4`.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The fraction is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, especially if we consider the lowest order of radiation. The radiation from such a dipole is not isotropic (uniform in all directions).\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `K` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment and the frequency of oscillation.\n\n    The problem states that `f(\\lambda, θ)` is the radiated power per unit solid angle, so we can write `f(\\lambda, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n\n    The maximum radiated power, denoted by `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis).\n    Therefore, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`.\n\n    We need to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. The power at this angle is:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_(\\theta=30°) = K * sin²(30°)`\n\n    The fraction is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power A:\n    Fraction = `(K * sin²(30°)) / A = (K * sin²(30°)) / K = sin²(30°)`\n\n    Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, the fraction is:\n    Fraction = `(1/2)² = 1/4`\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The constant `K` in the power formula is not actually a constant with respect to frequency or wavelength. The full expression for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle for an electric dipole is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    Here, `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    The radiated power per unit solid angle, `f`, is therefore proportional to `ω⁴`:\n    `f ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc / λ`. Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n    `f ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of radiation from dipoles, famously seen in Rayleigh scattering.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**, and a possible form of the wavelength dependence for the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
