    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium**. This is an **iminium salt**. Let's deconstruct its structure:\n*   **Pentan-2-ylidene**: This indicates the carbon backbone comes from pentan-2-one (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃). The double bond is to the nitrogen at the C2 position. The structure is CH₃-C(=N)-CH₂CH₂CH₃.\n*   **N-methyl-N-...-ethanaminium**: The nitrogen atom is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The \"aminium\" suffix indicates the nitrogen has a positive charge (N⁺) and is tetravalent.\n*   **Combining these parts**: The structure of the iminium cation is [CH₃-C(=N⁺(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃))-CH₂CH₂CH₃].\n*   **Stereochemistry (E)**: This refers to the configuration around the C=N double bond. The groups on the carbon are -CH₃ and -CH₂CH₂CH₃. The groups on the nitrogen are -CH₃ and -CH₂CH₂CH₃. According to Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, the propyl group has higher priority than methyl on carbon, and the ethyl group has higher priority than methyl on nitrogen. In the (E) isomer, these higher-priority groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. While interesting, the stereochemistry does not affect the outcome of this particular reaction sequence.\n\nThe iminium salt has acidic protons on the carbons alpha (α) to the C=N⁺ group. These are at C1 (the methyl group) and C3 (the methylene group).\nα-protons: **(H₃C)**-C(=N⁺R₂)-**(CH₂)**-CH₂CH₃\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction Sequence (Reagents A)**\n\nThe proposed reaction sequence involves three distinct steps, which are typical for an enamine alkylation (or in this case, an iminium salt deprotonation-alkylation). The steps must be performed sequentially.\n\n*   **Step (i): (i) LDA, DME**\n    *   **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a very strong, sterically hindered (bulky), non-nucleophilic base. Its primary role is to deprotonate carbon acids.\n    *   **DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane)** is a polar aprotic solvent that is suitable for reactions involving organolithium reagents like LDA.\n    *   LDA will deprotonate the iminium salt at one of the α-positions to form a neutral **enamine**.\n    *   Because LDA is bulky, it preferentially removes the most sterically accessible proton. This is known as **kinetic control**. The protons on the C1 methyl group are less sterically hindered than the protons on the C3 methylene group.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation occurs at C1:\n        [**H**-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + LDA → H₂C=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + [LDA-H]⁺\n    *   The product of this step is the less-substituted (kinetic) enamine.\n\n*   **Step (ii): (ii) CH₃CH₂I**\n    *   **CH₃CH₂I (Iodoethane or ethyl iodide)** is an electrophile and an alkylating agent.\n    *   The enamine formed in step (i) is nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the terminal CH₂ of the double bond). The lone pair on the nitrogen pushes electron density to this carbon.\n    *   The enamine attacks the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the C1 position and re-forming an iminium salt.\n        **H₂C**=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + **CH₃CH₂**-I → [**CH₃CH₂**-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + I⁻\n    *   The new iminium salt has a longer carbon chain. The original C1 methyl group is now a propyl group (CH₃CH₂-CH₂-).\n\n*   **Step (iii): (iii) H₃O⁺**\n    *   **H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, from adding aqueous acid)** is used for hydrolysis.\n    *   The iminium salt is readily hydrolyzed by water under acidic conditions. The C=N⁺ bond is cleaved and replaced with a C=O (carbonyl) bond, regenerating a ketone. The nitrogen part becomes a protonated secondary amine.\n        [CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + H₂O → CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + [H₂N⁺R₂]\n    *   The organic product `B` is the newly formed ketone.\n\n### **3. Identify the Final Product (B)**\n\nLet's identify the ketone formed after hydrolysis:\n*   The structure is **CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃**.\n*   This is a symmetrical ketone with a propyl group on each side of the carbonyl.\n*   To name it using IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain containing the carbonyl group. The chain has 7 carbons (heptane).\n*   We number the chain to give the carbonyl carbon the lowest possible number. Numbering from either end gives the carbonyl carbon position 4.\n*   Therefore, the product `B` is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow we compare our derived reagents and product with the given options.\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   The reagent sequence (A) is correct.\n    *   The product (B) is incorrect. The product is heptan-4-one, not the starting material pentan-2-one.\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   The reagent sequence is written incorrectly. It implies adding the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid all at once in step (ii). This is chemically unfeasible as the base (LDA) would be instantly neutralized by the acid (H₃O⁺).\n    *   The product (B) is correct.\n\n*   **C) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   This option correctly identifies **A** as the proper three-step sequence of reagents.\n    *   This option correctly identifies **B** as the final product, **heptan-4-one**.\n    *   This option is fully consistent with our analysis.\n\n*   **D) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   The reagent sequence is written incorrectly (same as B).\n    *   The product (B) is incorrect (same as A).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOption C provides both the correct, chemically sound sequence of reagents (A) and the correct final product (B).\n\n<<<C>>>"
