    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nitration of toluene, an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) generates the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH3) on the benzene ring.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group is an ortho, para-director. It activates the ring and directs the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho (2,6) and para (4) to it.\n*   **Product 1:** Due to steric hindrance from the bulky methyl group, the para-substituted product is the major product. Therefore, Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Structure of Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene):**\n```\n      CH3\n      |\n   /-----\\\n  |       |\n ||       ||\n  |       |\n   \\-----/\n      |\n     NO2\n```\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with MnO2 and H2SO4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) in the presence of a strong acid like sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n*   **Transformation:** It oxidizes the alkyl side-chain (the methyl group, -CH3) of the aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO2) is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group. Therefore, Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzoic acid** (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n**Structure of Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid):**\n```\n      COOH\n      |\n   /-----\\\n  |       |\n ||       ||\n  |       |\n   \\-----/\n      |\n     NO2\n```\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide**\n\n*   **Reactants:** p-nitrobenzoic acid, acetone ((CH3)2CO), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Conditions:** The medium is basic due to NaOH. The first thing that happens is an acid-base reaction where the carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate. The base also generates the enolate from acetone, which is a nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents (a nitroaromatic compound, a ketone, and a base) can lead to several reactions.\n    *   One possibility is a nucleophilic attack of the acetone enolate on the electron-deficient aromatic ring (a Janovsky-type reaction) to form a Meisenheimer complex. However, this complex is an intermediate and has C1 symmetry, which is not among the options.\n    *   A more plausible reaction that leads to a stable final product is the **reductive coupling** of the nitroarene. In basic conditions, acetone can act as a reducing agent (it gets oxidized), causing the reduction and dimerization of the nitro compound to form an azo compound.\n*   **Transformation:** Two molecules of p-nitrobenzoic acid are coupled at the nitrogen atoms to form an azobenzene derivative. The nitro groups (-NO2) are reduced and linked to form an azo group (-N=N-).\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting product is **4,4'-azobis(benzoic acid)**. The azo group (-N=N-) can exist as two geometric isomers: E (trans) and Z (cis). The E-isomer is significantly more stable due to lower steric hindrance and is the expected major product in a thermal reaction.\n\n**Structure of Product 3 (E-4,4'-azobis(benzoic acid)):**\n```\n      HOOC-\\ /-\\ /-\\ /-N=N-\\ /-\\ /-\\ /-COOH\n             C---C   C       C   C---C\n             |   |  //       \\\\  |   |\n             C===C /           \\ C===C\n             \\   /               \\   /\n              H                     H\n```\n(A 2D representation showing the trans-azo link between two para-substituted benzoic acid moieties)\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\nWe need to find the point group for the stable **E-isomer of 4,4'-azobis(benzoic acid)**. Let's analyze its symmetry elements, assuming the molecule is planar or near-planar.\n\n1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n2.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is a center of symmetry at the midpoint of the N=N double bond. Inverting any atom through this point (x,y,z) -> (-x,-y,-z) results in an identical atom.\n3.  **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cn):** There is a two-fold axis of rotation (C2) that is perpendicular to the N=N bond and lies in the molecular plane. Rotating the molecule by 180° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n4.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** There is a mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C2 axis. If we consider the molecule to be planar, this plane is the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nA point group that contains the symmetry elements E, C2, i, and σh is the **C2h** point group.\n\n*   Option A) c2h: Matches our finding.\n*   Option B) cs: This would be the symmetry of the Z-isomer, which is less stable. It has only a mirror plane.\n*   Option C) d2h: This group has higher symmetry, requiring three perpendicular C2 axes, which this molecule does not possess.\n*   Option D) c3: This requires a three-fold axis of rotation, which is clearly absent.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is C2h.\n\n<<<A>>>"
