    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We need to find the structure that has protons which would give rise to both a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt).\n\nThe multiplicity of a signal is described by the `n+1` rule, where `n` is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of protons, its signal is split by each set sequentially.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** The proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups: one proton (giving a doublet, d), a group of two protons (giving a triplet, t), and a group of three protons (giving a quartet, q).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** The proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups: one proton (giving a doublet, d), a group of two protons (giving a triplet, t), and another, different group of two protons (giving another triplet, t).\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the methine (C-H) protons in each proposed structure.\n\n**A) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      (d)CH₃   (c)CH₃\n        |       |\nHOOC -- C(H) -- C(H) -- CH₂(b) -- CH₃(a)\n        (e)     (f)\n```\n*   **H(f):** Coupled to H(e) (1H, d), the CH₃ group (c) (3H, q), and the CH₂ group (b) (2H, t). This gives a **dqt**.\n*   This structure has a `dqt` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n**B) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      (d)CH₂CH₃  (c)CH₂CH₃\n          |          |\nHOOC -- C(H) --    C(H) -- CH₂(b) -- CH₃(a)\n        (e)        (f)\n```\n*   **H(f):** Coupled to H(e) (1H, d), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (c) (2H, t), and the CH₂ group (b) (2H, t). This gives a **dtt**.\n*   This structure has a `dtt` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dqt`.\n\n**C) `CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      (d)CH₃   (c)CH₃\n        |       |\n(e)CH₃- C(H) -- C(H) -- CH₂(b) -- COOH\n        (f)     (g)\n```\n*   **H(g):** Coupled to H(f) (1H, d), the CH₃ group (c) (3H, q), and the CH₂ group (b) (2H, t). This gives a **dqt**.\n*   This structure has a `dqt` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n**D) `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's draw this structure and label the key protons.\n```\n        (d)CH₂CH₃  (c)CH₂CH₃\n           |          |\n(a)CH₃ -- C(H) --    C(H) -- CH₂(b) -- COOH\n        (f)        (e)\n```\nNow, let's analyze the protons on the main chain's chiral centers, H(e) and H(f).\n*   **Proton H(e):** This proton is on carbon 3. It is coupled to:\n    1.  Proton H(f) on carbon 4 (1 neighbor -> **doublet, d**).\n    2.  The two protons of the CH₂ group at carbon 2 (2 neighbors -> **triplet, t**).\n    3.  The two protons of the CH₂ part of the ethyl group attached to carbon 3 (2 neighbors -> **triplet, t**).\n    The resulting multiplicity for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(f):** This proton is on carbon 4. It is coupled to:\n    1.  Proton H(e) on carbon 3 (1 neighbor -> **doublet, d**).\n    2.  The two protons of the CH₂ part of the ethyl group attached to carbon 4 (2 neighbors -> **triplet, t**).\n    3.  The three protons of the CH₃ group at carbon 5 (3 neighbors -> **quartet, q**).\n    The resulting multiplicity for H(f) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that possesses two distinct proton environments that would generate both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
