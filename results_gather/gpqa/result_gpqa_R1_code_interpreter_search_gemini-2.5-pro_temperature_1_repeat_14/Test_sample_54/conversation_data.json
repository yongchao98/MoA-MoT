    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Basic Groups**\n\n*   First, let's sum the number of protons (the 'H' value in each signal description): 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Let's check the proton count for the options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): Has 8 protons. This matches.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Has 10 protons. This does not match.\n*   This initial analysis immediately rules out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate, as they have the wrong number of protons. The compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals for Propenyl Acetate**\n\nNow we need to distinguish between the *cis* and *trans* isomers of propenyl acetate. The structure is CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon in an acetate group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This fits the acetate methyl group. This signal is present in both cis and trans isomers.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This matches the structure, as it's coupled to the neighboring vinyl proton.\n\n*   **Signal 3 & 4: The Vinylic Protons and Stereochemistry**\n    We have two signals left for the two protons on the double bond (O-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   **Signal 3: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** One proton.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (C=C-H). The high value is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom (O-**CH**=CH-).\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one other proton, which is the other vinylic proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond reveals their stereochemistry.\n            *   **Trans coupling (protons on opposite sides): J is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.**\n            *   **Cis coupling (protons on the same side): J is typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.**\n        *   A J-value of **16.0 Hz** strongly indicates a **trans** configuration.\n\n    *   **Signal 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** One proton.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** The other vinylic proton (O-CH=**CH**-CH3).\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighbors. It is split into a **doublet** by the other single vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and it is further split into a **quartet** by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm). This splitting pattern perfectly matches the structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of protons (8H) indicates the compound is a propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons is definitive evidence for a *trans* arrangement across the double bond. All other signals (chemical shifts, integrations, and multiplicities) are fully consistent with the structure of trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
