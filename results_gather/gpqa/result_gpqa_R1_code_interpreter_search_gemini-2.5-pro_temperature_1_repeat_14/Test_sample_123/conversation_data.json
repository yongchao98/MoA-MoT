    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves two key concepts from physics: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:** The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n3.  **Apply Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particles as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than their proper lifetime (`τ`). The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Consider the Lab Frame:** The decay process must be analyzed in the lab frame. In this frame, the particles travel a distance `R` (the detector's radius) to reach the walls. The time taken for this travel (`t_lab`) is:\n    `t_lab = R / v`\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. Therefore, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Concepts:** Now, we can write the survival fraction `f` in terms of the lab frame quantities:\n    `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n    `f = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ))`\n\n6.  **Identify Constants:** In this problem, the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the proper lifetime of the particle `τ` are all constants. Let's group them into a single constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. The equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n7.  **Set up Equations for Both Scenarios:** We have two scenarios with different Lorentz factors and survival fractions. We can use the equation `f = exp(-K / γ)` to relate them. It's easier to work with the natural logarithm of the equation:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    Rearranging gives:\n    `γ * -ln(f) = K`\n    or\n    `γ * ln(1/f) = K`\n\n    Since `K` is a constant, this relationship must hold for both scenarios.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Equation: `20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = K`  => `20 * ln(3) = K`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?` (This is what we need to find)\n        *   Survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   Equation: `γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3)) = K` => `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = K`\n\n8.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):** Since both expressions are equal to the same constant `K`, we can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** To get the final answer, we compute the value of this expression. This can be done with a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# From the derived formula:\n# gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\ngamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n> 54.1851125134769\n\nThe calculated value for `γ₂` is approximately 54.19.\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `54.19` is closest to the given option B.\n\n*   A) 40\n*   B) 54\n*   C) 68\n*   D) 28\n\nTherefore, the correct Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem can be solved by combining the principles of special relativity (specifically time dilation) and exponential decay.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is governed by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the detector (the lab frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:** The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector's radius `R` in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Survival Fraction in the Lab Frame:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is the fraction that survives for the duration of the time of flight `t_lab`. We need to use the decay law with the time and lifetime measured in the same frame (the lab frame):\n    `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations:** Substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the survival fraction equation:\n    `f = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K`, since they do not change between the two scenarios: `K = R / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n6.  **Setting up a Ratio for the Two Scenarios:** It's easier to work with the natural logarithm of this equation:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    Rearranging gives:\n    `γ * ln(1/f) = K`\n\n    Since `K` is a constant, this relationship must hold for both scenarios.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        `20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = K`  => `20 * ln(3) = K`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        `γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3)) = K` => `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = K`\n\n7.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):** We can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:** We can compute this value using a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the derived formula: gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma2)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.19.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is ~54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 40\n    B) 54\n    C) 68\n    D) 28\n\n    The closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The calculation shows that the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. This value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
