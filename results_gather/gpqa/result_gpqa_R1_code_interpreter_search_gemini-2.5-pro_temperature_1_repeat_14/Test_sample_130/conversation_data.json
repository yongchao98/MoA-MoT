    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data for this anhydride is given: `1H NMR` shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and `13C NMR` shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Let's analyze the NMR data for the anhydride:\n        *   `1H NMR`: A single peak at 7 ppm indicates two or more protons that are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic or aromatic region.\n        *   `13C NMR`: Two peaks. The peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O). The peak at 137 ppm is characteristic of a vinylic carbon (C=C).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the data:\n        *   Structure: A five-membered ring containing O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two vinylic carbons equivalent.\n        *   `1H NMR`: One signal for the two equivalent vinylic protons. The chemical shift is indeed around 7.08 ppm.\n        *   `13C NMR`: Two signals. One for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) and one for the two equivalent vinylic carbons (~135 ppm).\n    *   The data perfectly matches maleic anhydride. So, the first reactant is maleic anhydride (C4H2O3).\n    *   The second reactant is explicitly named: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C9H14).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   The product is a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula is C4H2O3 + C9H14 = C13H16O3, which matches the information provided.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetic product and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamic product and is typically the **minor product**.\n    *   Let's establish the structure of these adducts. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C7 methylene bridge. This places the two protons on the anhydride-fused carbons (let's call them H-2 and H-3) in the *exo* position (pointing towards the C7 bridge).\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same face) to the C7 methylene bridge. This places H-2 and H-3 in the *endo* position (pointing away from the C7 bridge, towards the C=C double bond).\n\n3.  **Analyze the NMR Spectra of the Products:**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both the *endo* and *exo* products, the `1H NMR` spectrum is expected to show:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups (on C1 and C4).\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (on C5 and C6).\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons H-2 and H-3. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable for these protons, which are alpha to carbonyl groups.\n        *   Two signals for the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 methylene bridge. These would likely appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is reasonable for these aliphatic protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5Ã…).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* adduct.\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial relationships in each isomer:\n        *   **Major Product (Endo adduct):**\n            *   The protons H-2 and H-3 are in the *exo* position.\n            *   In this orientation, the *exo* protons are close to the bridgehead substituents. Here, the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4) have methyl groups. Therefore, an NOE is expected between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl protons.\n            *   The *exo* H-2/H-3 protons are relatively far from the C7 bridge protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n        *   **Minor Product (Exo adduct):**\n            *   The protons H-2 and H-3 are in the *endo* position.\n            *   In this orientation, the *endo* protons are far from the bridgehead methyl groups.\n            *   They are, however, close to the vinylic methyl groups (on C5, C6) and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Match the Analysis with the Options:**\n    *   The unique NOE in the major product is between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl protons.\n    *   Let's identify the corresponding signals from the options:\n        *   The H-2/H-3 protons give the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`.\n        *   The bridgehead methyl protons give one of the `6H singlets` (e.g., the one at `~1.7 ppm`).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` and a `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n\n    *   This corresponds directly to **Option D**.\n\n    *   Let's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n        *   A) 6H singlet and 6H singlet: Interaction between the two sets of methyl groups. This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n        *   B) 6H singlet and 1H doublet: Interaction between a methyl group and a C7 proton. This would also likely be present in both isomers to some extent.\n        *   C) 1H doublet and 2H singlet: Interaction between a C7 proton and the H-2/H-3 protons. This interaction is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the cross-peak is between the H-2/H-3 protons and the bridgehead methyl groups, which is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
