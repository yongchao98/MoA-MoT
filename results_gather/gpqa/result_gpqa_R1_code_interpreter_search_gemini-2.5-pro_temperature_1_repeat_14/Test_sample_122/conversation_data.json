    "This is a classic special relativity problem involving time dilation. Here is the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Identify Frames of Reference and Given Information\n*   **Stationary Frame of Reference (S):** The Galaxy. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame of Reference (S'):** The supernova ejecta.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving at `v = 60,000 km/s` relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n\n### 2. Determine the Goal\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (frame S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Physics Plan\n1.  The distance traveled in any frame is calculated as `distance = speed × time`. In the Galaxy's frame (S), this is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n2.  We are given the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`), not the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). Due to the effects of special relativity, time passes differently in the two frames. This phenomenon is called **time dilation**.\n3.  We need to use the time dilation formula to find the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame that corresponds to `Δt₀ = 50 s` in the ejecta's frame. The formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n4.  The Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light.\n5.  Once we calculate `Δt`, we can find the distance `d` using `d = v * Δt`.\n\n### 4. Execute the Calculation\nLet's perform the calculations step-by-step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    The speed of light, `c`, is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define constants\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # s\nc = 299792.458 # km/s (precise value)\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta = v / c\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d)\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance=}\")\n\n# Alternative calculation route:\n# Calculate distance from ejecta's perspective\n# d_prime = v * delta_t0\n# Distance in Galaxy frame is d = gamma * d_prime\n# d_alt = gamma * (v * delta_t0)\n# print(f\"{d_alt=}\")\n```\n>>>\ndistance=3061953.5186307845\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the distance is approximately `3,061,954 km`.\n\n### 5. Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated distance is `3,061,954 km`. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option D. The small difference (less than 0.07%) is likely due to the options being rounded. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nA common mistake would be to calculate the distance without considering time dilation (`d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`), which corresponds to option C. This is incorrect because it mixes the velocity from one frame with the time from another without the proper relativistic correction. The distance of 3,000,000 km is the distance the Galaxy's center travels from the perspective of the ejecta. The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels from the perspective of the Galaxy.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame of reference is the Galaxy (let's call it frame S).\n    *   The \"moving\" frame of reference is the supernova ejecta (let's call it frame S').\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (S'), also known as the proper time, is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame of reference (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the time measured in the ejecta's own frame (`Δt₀`).\n    *   The relationship between these two time intervals is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β).**\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n        (This shows that for the 50 seconds that pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures about 51.03 seconds passing).\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        Using the exact values for better precision:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,950.5 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,950.5 km.\n    *   Let's look at the choices:\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 2,880,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n        D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    *   The calculated value is closest to option D. The small difference is due to rounding in the question's options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
