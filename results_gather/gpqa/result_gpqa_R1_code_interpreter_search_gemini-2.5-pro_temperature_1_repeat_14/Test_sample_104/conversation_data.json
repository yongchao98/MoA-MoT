    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The core of the problem is to compare two different phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim: rotational modulation due to starspots and a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the size of a planet that would produce a dimming effect equal to that caused by the spots.\n\n2.  **Model the Flux Variation from Starspots:**\n    *   The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing us either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted one. The amplitude of this variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, normalized by the maximum brightness.\n    *   We will use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when we see the unspotted hemisphere. The entire visible disk has a temperature `Teff`. Let the flux be proportional to `Teff^4`.\n        `F_max ∝ Teff^4`\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when we see the spotted hemisphere. The visible disk is a composite of the normal stellar surface and cooler spots.\n        *   The filling factor, `f`, is the fraction of the visible disk covered by spots. Here, `f = 0.20`.\n        *   The area of the normal surface is `(1 - f)` of the total area.\n        *   The area of the spots is `f` of the total area.\n        *   The spot temperature is `Tspot = Teff - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n        *   The total flux is the weighted average of the flux from the two components.\n            `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * Tspot^4`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot Signal:**\n    *   The amplitude of the variation is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   `Amplitude = (Teff^4 - [(1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * Tspot^4]) / Teff^4`\n    *   `Amplitude = (Teff^4 - Teff^4 + f * Teff^4 - f * Tspot^4) / Teff^4`\n    *   `Amplitude = (f * Teff^4 - f * Tspot^4) / Teff^4`\n    *   Simplifying this gives: `Amplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)`\n\n4.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit Signal:**\n    *   When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks a fraction of the starlight. This dip in brightness is called the transit depth.\n    *   For a uniform, unspotted star, the transit depth is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    *   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2) = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\n5.  **Equate the Signals and Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius:**\n    *   The problem requires the transit depth to be equal to the spot signal amplitude.\n    *   `(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)`\n    *   `Rpl / Rstar = sqrt( f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4) )`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   We can now substitute the given values into the final equation.\n    *   `f = 0.20`\n    *   `Teff = 6000 K`\n    *   `Tspot = 5000 K`\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\nTeff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nTspot = 5000  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of the hypothetical exoplanet is equal to this amplitude.\n# Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)**2\n# Therefore, Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(Amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>0.32\n\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `Rpl/Rstar` is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The brightness variation amplitude caused by the spots is given by the fractional change in flux between the unspotted and spotted hemispheres. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T⁴), the amplitude is:\nAmplitude = (Flux_max - Flux_min) / Flux_max\n\n*   **Flux_max** corresponds to the unspotted hemisphere: Flux_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n*   **Flux_min** corresponds to the spotted hemisphere. A fraction `f` of the surface is at T_spot and a fraction `(1-f)` is at T_eff: Flux_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\nAmplitude = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nThe dip in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area:\nTransit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWe are looking for the case where the transit depth equals the spot-induced amplitude:\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * 0.51775\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
