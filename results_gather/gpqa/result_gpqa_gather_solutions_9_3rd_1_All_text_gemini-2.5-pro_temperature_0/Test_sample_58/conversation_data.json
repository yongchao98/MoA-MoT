Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step. We need to find the number of moles of the weak acid (CH₃COOH), the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl), and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely.\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates completely.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reaction.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids until one is consumed.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Comparing the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), we see that the base is in excess.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration and pH.**\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical point is recognizing that Ba(OH)₂ is a dihydroxide base, providing two moles of OH⁻ for every one mole of Ba(OH)₂.\n2.  **Complete Neutralization:** Because a strong base is present, it will react completely with all available acid, including the weak acid CH₃COOH. The problem simplifies to a limiting reactant calculation.\n3.  **Total Volume:** The final concentration must be calculated using the sum of all individual volumes (1200 mL or 1.2 L).\n4.  **pOH to pH Conversion:** A common mistake is to stop at the pOH calculation (1.38). The question asks for pH, requiring the final conversion step (pH = 14 - pOH). Note that the pOH value is listed as option D, making it a classic distractor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a pH of **12.62**. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 12.62\nC) 8.68\nD) 1.38\n\nThe correct answer is 12.62, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, a thorough step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction is necessary.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles of Acidic and Basic Species:** The first step is to determine the number of moles of all reactive species being mixed.\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n        Moles = Volume (L) × Molarity (mol/L) = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = **0.050 mol**\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        HCl dissociates completely.\n        Moles H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = **0.080 mol**\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n        Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to yield two OH⁻ ions.\n        Moles OH⁻ = 0.300 L × 0.3 M × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n2.  **Perform Neutralization Reaction:** The total moles of base (OH⁻) will react with the total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents). The reaction goes to completion.\n    *   **Total moles of acid:**\n        Total Acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of base:**\n        Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n    *   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n        Comparing the total moles, the base is in excess.\n        Excess Moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Concentration and pH:** The final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n    *   **Calculate the total volume:**\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n    *   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = Excess Moles / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n    *   **Calculate the pOH:**\n        pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate the pH:**\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points\n\nBased on the analysis of the problem and the candidate answers, several critical points must be considered to avoid errors:\n\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** It is crucial to remember that one mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻ ions. This is a common point of error.\n*   **Complete Neutralization:** The strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). The final pH is determined by what is left in excess.\n*   **Total Volume for Final Concentration:** The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the total combined volume of all three solutions (1200 mL or 1.2 L).\n*   **pOH to pH Conversion:** A frequent mistake is to calculate the pOH (1.38) and incorrectly report it as the final answer. Since the solution has excess hydroxide, one must calculate pOH first and then convert it to pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH. Option D (1.38) is a classic distractor representing the pOH value.\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a pH of 12.62, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this acid-base chemistry problem by first calculating the total moles of acidic protons and the total moles of hydroxide ions. Then, I will determine which species is in excess after the neutralization reaction. Finally, I will calculate the concentration of the excess species in the total volume of the solution and use that to determine the final pH.\n\nHere are the key steps and careful points I will consider:\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:** I will calculate the moles of each reactant (CH3COOH, HCl, Ba(OH)2).\n2.  **Identify Strong vs. Weak:** HCl is a strong acid, CH3COOH is a weak acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n3.  **Careful Point 1: Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)2:** Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)2, is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** hydroxide ions (OH-) for every one formula unit. This is a critical detail.\n4.  **Determine Excess Reactant:** I will sum the total moles of acid (from HCl + CH3COOH) and compare it to the total moles of base (from Ba(OH)2) to find out which is in excess.\n5.  **Calculate Final Concentration:** The concentration of the excess species (H+ or OH-) will be calculated by dividing its excess moles by the total final volume of the solution.\n6.  **Careful Point 2: pOH to pH Conversion:** Since the base is in excess, the calculation will first yield the concentration of OH-, which is used to find the pOH. I must remember to convert the pOH to pH using the formula: pH = 14 - pOH. Mistaking the pOH for the pH is a common error.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial conditions and calculate moles\n# CH3COOH (weak acid)\nvol_ch3cooh = 500 / 1000  # L\nconc_ch3cooh = 0.1       # M\nmoles_ch3cooh = vol_ch3cooh * conc_ch3cooh\n\n# HCl (strong acid)\nvol_hcl = 400 / 1000  # L\nconc_hcl = 0.2       # M\nmoles_h_strong = vol_hcl * conc_hcl\n\n# Ba(OH)2 (strong base)\nvol_baoh2 = 300 / 1000  # L\nconc_baoh2 = 0.3       # M\n# Careful Point 1: Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- per mole of Ba(OH)2\nmoles_oh_strong = (vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2) * 2\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Perform neutralization and find excess reactant\n# The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons\ntotal_moles_acid = moles_h_strong + moles_ch3cooh\ntotal_moles_base = moles_oh_strong\n\n# Determine which is in excess\nif total_moles_base > total_moles_acid:\n    moles_excess_species = total_moles_base - total_moles_acid\n    excess_species_name = \"OH-\"\nelse:\n    moles_excess_species = total_moles_acid - total_moles_base\n    excess_species_name = \"H+\"\n\n# Step 4: Calculate final concentration\ntotal_volume = vol_ch3cooh + vol_hcl + vol_baoh2\nconc_excess_species = moles_excess_species / total_volume\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final pH\n# Careful Point 2: Check if we need to convert from pOH\nif excess_species_name == \"OH-\":\n    pOH = -math.log10(conc_excess_species)\n    pH = 14 - pOH\nelse: # excess_species_name == \"H+\"\n    pH = -math.log10(conc_excess_species)\n    pOH = 14 - pH\n\n# Print the results and choices\nprint(f\"Total moles of acid (H+): {total_moles_acid:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Total moles of base (OH-): {total_moles_base:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Excess moles of {excess_species_name}: {moles_excess_species:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Total volume: {total_volume:.3f} L\")\nprint(f\"Final [{excess_species_name}]: {conc_excess_species:.5f} M\")\nif excess_species_name == \"OH-\":\n    print(f\"Calculated pOH: {pOH:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated pH: {pH:.2f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(f\"A) 1.38\")\nprint(f\"B) 12.62\")\nprint(f\"C) 8.92\")\nprint(f\"D) 8.68\")\n\n# Final decision based on calculation\nif round(pH, 2) == 1.38:\n    final_choice = \"A\"\nelif round(pH, 2) == 12.62:\n    final_choice = \"B\"\nelif round(pH, 2) == 8.92:\n    final_choice = \"C\"\nelif round(pH, 2) == 8.68:\n    final_choice = \"D\"\nelse:\n    final_choice = \"Calculation does not match any option.\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated pH of {pH:.2f} matches option {final_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Total moles of acid (H+): 0.130 mol\nTotal moles of base (OH-): 0.180 mol\nExcess moles of OH-: 0.050 mol\nTotal volume: 1.200 L\nFinal [OH-]: 0.04167 M\nCalculated pOH: 1.38\nCalculated pH: 12.62\n\nChoices:\nA) 1.38\nB) 12.62\nC) 8.92\nD) 8.68\n\nThe calculated pH of 12.62 matches option B.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires us to find the final pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. The final pH will be determined by the species that is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

Perform the neutralization reaction to find the excess reactant.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We can sum the total moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Comparing the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), we see that the base is in excess.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the final pH.**\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻). The contribution of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** It is critical to remember that Ba(OH)₂ provides two moles of OH⁻ per mole of the compound.\n2.  **Total Acid:** In the presence of a strong base, both strong and weak acids will be neutralized. Their moles must be summed to find the total acid content.\n3.  **Total Volume:** The final concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solution.\n4.  **pOH vs. pH:** A common mistake is to calculate the pOH (1.38) and report it as the pH. The question asks for pH, which requires the conversion: pH = 14 - pOH. Option D (1.38) is a distractor targeting this error.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated pH is 12.62.

The analysis of the candidate answers shows a universal agreement on the calculation method and the final numerical result of 12.62. Discrepancies in their final letter choices are likely due to errors in matching the result to a differently ordered list of options. Based on the options provided in the question, 12.62 corresponds to A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Perform the Neutralization Reaction**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We can sum the total moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Compare total base (0.180 mol) to total acid (0.130 mol).\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total Base - Total Acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**4.

The consensus on the calculation itself is strong.\n\n### Careful Points for Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Species and Stoichiometry**: It is critical to correctly identify the reactants: a weak acid (CH₃COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)₂). A crucial detail is that one mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to produce **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n2.  **Complete Neutralization**: A strong base like Ba(OH)₂ will react completely with all available acidic protons, both from the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). The reaction is not an equilibrium; it goes to completion until the limiting reactant is consumed.\n3.  **Excess Reactant Dictates pH**: The final pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the species in excess. If a strong acid or strong base is in excess, its concentration is used to directly calculate the pH or pOH. The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible compared to the excess strong base.\n4.  **Total Volume**: When calculating the final concentration of the excess species, it is essential to use the total volume of the mixed solution.\n5.  **pOH to pH Conversion**: A common mistake is to calculate the pOH from an excess of hydroxide ions and report that value as the pH. One must remember to convert pOH to pH using the formula: pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:**\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n        0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n        0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n2.  **Perform Neutralization:**\n    *   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n        0.050 mol (from CH₃COOH) + 0.080 mol (from HCl) = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n        **0.180 mol**\n    *   **Determine Excess Reactant:**\n        The moles of base (0.180) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130). Therefore, the strong base is in excess.\n    *   **Calculate Excess Moles of OH⁻:**\n        0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Concentration and pH:**\n    *   **Total Volume:**\n        500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n    *   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculated pH of the final solution is 12.62. This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct answer, a thorough step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction is necessary. The calculation must be performed carefully, paying attention to several key points where errors can easily be made.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step. We need to find the number of moles of the weak acid (CH₃COOH), the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl), and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reaction.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids until one side is completely consumed.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Comparing the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), it is clear the base is in excess.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration and pH.**\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical point is recognizing that Barium Hydroxide is a dihydroxide base, providing two moles of OH⁻ for every one mole of Ba(OH)₂. Forgetting the factor of 2 is a major error.\n2.  **Total Acid Calculation:** The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons. Therefore, the moles of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) must be added to the moles of the strong acid (HCl) to find the total moles of acid that will be consumed.\n3.  **Final Volume:** The final concentration must be calculated using the total combined volume of all three solutions (500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL).\n4.  **pOH vs. pH:** The calculation from the excess hydroxide concentration first yields the pOH (1.38). This value must be subtracted from 14 to find the pH. It is a common mistake to stop at the pOH, which is often provided as a distractor option (Option C).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a final pH of **12.62**.

Failing to multiply by two is a common error.\n2.  **Total Acidic Protons:** The strong base will react with all available protons. Therefore, the moles of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) must be added to the moles of the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) to find the total moles of acid to be neutralized.\n3.  **pOH vs. pH:** The calculation using the excess hydroxide concentration first yields the pOH (~1.38). A frequent mistake is to stop here and report the pOH as the final answer. The final step of converting to pH (pH = 14 - pOH) is essential. Option B (1.38) is a distractor representing the pOH value.\n4.  **Excess Strong Species:** When a strong acid or strong base is in excess, it dictates the final pH. The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed during the reaction has a negligible effect on the pH compared to the excess strong base.\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a pH of 12.62.

This factor of two is a common source of error.\n*   **Complete Neutralization:** The strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). The reaction goes to completion.\n*   **Excess Reactant:** The final pH is dictated by the concentration of the species in excess. In this case, the excess strong base (OH⁻) determines the pH, and the contribution from the newly formed weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible.\n*   **pOH to pH Conversion:** A frequent mistake is to calculate the pOH (1.38) and select it as the final answer. It is essential to complete the final step and convert pOH to pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.

Then, I will determine which species is in excess after the neutralization reaction. Finally, I will calculate the concentration of the excess species in the total volume of the solution and use that to determine the final pH.\n\nHere are the key steps and careful points I will consider:\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:** I will calculate the moles of each reactant (CH3COOH, HCl, Ba(OH)2).\n2.  **Identify Strong vs. Weak:** HCl is a strong acid, CH3COOH is a weak acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n3.  **Careful Point 1: Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)2:** Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)2, is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** hydroxide ions (OH-) for every one formula unit.

The final pH will be determined by the species that is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step. We must calculate the moles of H⁺ ions from the acids and OH⁻ ions from the base.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides two OH⁻ ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reaction to find the excess reactant.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We can sum the total moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Comparing the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), we see that the base is in excess.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the final pH.**\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻). The contribution of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** It is critical to remember that Ba(OH)₂ provides two moles of OH⁻ per mole of the compound.\n2.  **Total Acid:** In the presence of a strong base, both strong and weak acids will be neutralized. Their moles must be summed to find the total acid content.\n3.  **Total Volume:** The final concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solution.\n4.  **pOH vs. pH:** A common mistake is to calculate the pOH (1.38) and report it as the pH. The question asks for pH, which requires the conversion: pH = 14 - pOH. Option D (1.38) is a distractor targeting this error.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated pH is 12.62. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 12.62\nB) 8.68\nC) 8.92\nD) 1.38\n\nThe correct answer is A. The analysis of the candidate answers shows a universal agreement on the calculation method and the final numerical result of 12.62. Discrepancies in their final letter choices are likely due to errors in matching the result to a differently ordered list of options. Based on the options provided in the question, 12.62 corresponds to A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Calculate the Initial Moles of Acidic and Basic Species**\nThe first step is to calculate the number of moles of H⁺ ions (from both acids) and OH⁻ ions (from the base).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Ba(OH)₂ is a dihydroxide base, meaning each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**3. Perform the Neutralization Reaction**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We can sum the total moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Compare total base (0.180 mol) to total acid (0.130 mol).\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total Base - Total Acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Concentration and pH**\nThe final pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This value (1.38) is the pOH, not the pH. It is listed as option D, which is a common distractor.\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH is: pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.

All the provided candidate answers follow the correct calculation steps, but some fail to select the correct final option. The consensus on the calculation itself is strong.\n\n### Careful Points for Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Species and Stoichiometry**: It is critical to correctly identify the reactants: a weak acid (CH₃COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)₂). A crucial detail is that one mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to produce **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n2.  **Complete Neutralization**: A strong base like Ba(OH)₂ will react completely with all available acidic protons, both from the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). The reaction is not an equilibrium; it goes to completion until the limiting reactant is consumed.\n3.  **Excess Reactant Dictates pH**: The final pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the species in excess. If a strong acid or strong base is in excess, its concentration is used to directly calculate the pH or pOH. The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible compared to the excess strong base.\n4.  **Total Volume**: When calculating the final concentration of the excess species, it is essential to use the total volume of the mixed solution.\n5.  **pOH to pH Conversion**: A common mistake is to calculate the pOH from an excess of hydroxide ions and report that value as the pH. One must remember to convert pOH to pH using the formula: pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:**\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n        0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n        0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n2.  **Perform Neutralization:**\n    *   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n        0.050 mol (from CH₃COOH) + 0.080 mol (from HCl) = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n        **0.180 mol**\n    *   **Determine Excess Reactant:**\n        The moles of base (0.180) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130). Therefore, the strong base is in excess.\n    *   **Calculate Excess Moles of OH⁻:**\n        0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Concentration and pH:**\n    *   **Total Volume:**\n        500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n    *   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculated pH of the final solution is 12.62. This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct answer, a thorough step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction is necessary. The calculation must be performed carefully, paying attention to several key points where errors can easily be made.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step. We need to find the number of moles of the weak acid (CH₃COOH), the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl), and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reaction.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids until one side is completely consumed.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol**\n*   **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    *   Comparing the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), it is clear the base is in excess.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration and pH.**\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical point is recognizing that Barium Hydroxide is a dihydroxide base, providing two moles of OH⁻ for every one mole of Ba(OH)₂. Forgetting the factor of 2 is a major error.\n2.  **Total Acid Calculation:** The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons. Therefore, the moles of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) must be added to the moles of the strong acid (HCl) to find the total moles of acid that will be consumed.\n3.  **Final Volume:** The final concentration must be calculated using the total combined volume of all three solutions (500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL).\n4.  **pOH vs. pH:** The calculation from the excess hydroxide concentration first yields the pOH (1.38). This value must be subtracted from 14 to find the pH. It is a common mistake to stop at the pOH, which is often provided as a distractor option (Option C).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a final pH of **12.62**.

The contribution from the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n4.  **pOH vs. pH:** A common mistake is to calculate the pOH (1.38) and select it as the final answer. The question asks for the pH, which requires the final conversion step (pH = 14 - pOH). Option A (1.38) is a classic distractor that represents the pOH.\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a pH of 12.62. Based on the provided options, this value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
