  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the building blocks of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these four protons strongly implies a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para). This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula and one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct –CH₃ signals but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**. One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a –CH₂– group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This means the fragment is either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula.\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a useful check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds in the structure.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Formulas (DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n\nThis calculation eliminates options C and D. We must now distinguish between A and B.\n\n### Step 4: Final Elimination and Selection\nOur detailed fragment analysis led to the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The other remaining option, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, has one more carbon and two more hydrogens, which corresponds to an extra -CH₂- group. The problem explicitly states there are **no -CH₂- groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Positive Evidence:** The specific ¹H NMR splitting pattern (doublet and doublet of quartets) is a key piece of positive evidence that strongly points to a propenyl group.\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The absence of –CH₂– signals is a critical piece of negative evidence that eliminates many potential structures, including the C₁₂H₁₄O₂ option.\n*   **DoU as a Filter:** Calculating the DoU is an excellent first step to quickly filter out impossible options, but it often leaves some ambiguity that must be resolved with more detailed spectral analysis.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** As seen in the candidate answers, a common mistake is to perform the chemical analysis correctly but then select the wrong letter from the multiple-choice list. It is crucial to carefully match the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the correct option letter.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:** The first step is to translate the information from FTIR and ¹H NMR into the building blocks of the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" This indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, which has a core formula of **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and classic splitting pattern unambiguously identifies a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has a formula of **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\" One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To include this methyl group without introducing a methylene (-CH₂-) group (which would be present in, for example, an ethyl ester -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃). Both of these possibilities contribute a **C₂H₃O₂** fragment to the overall formula.\n\n2.  **Assemble Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:** By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula.\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester and methyl part)\n    *   **Carbon (C) count:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H) count:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O) count:** **2**\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a check for the total number of rings and π-bonds, which must be consistent between the structure and the formula.\n    *   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **DoU from Formula Options:**\n        *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n        *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n        *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n        *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n\n4.  **Final Elimination and Decision:** The DoU calculation narrows the possibilities to C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂. The fragment analysis from the NMR data provides the deciding factor. Our detailed analysis constructed the molecule with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The alternative, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, contains one more carbon and two more hydrogens, which corresponds to an extra -CH₂- group. The problem explicitly states there are **no -CH₂- groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂. Therefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue for solving the puzzle. It allows for the direct elimination of C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Vinyl Splitting Pattern:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" as the signature of a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment.\n*   **Consensus vs. Clerical Error:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The variation in their final letter choices was due to inconsistent ordering of the options, not a flaw in their scientific reasoning.\n*   **Systematic Approach:** The most reliable method is to first build the formula from the fragments and then use the DoU as a verification step, rather than relying on DoU alone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the chemical analysis into logical steps, mirroring the consensus reasoning found in the candidate answers. I will deduce the molecular fragments from the spectroscopic data, assemble them to find the molecular formula, and then verify this formula using the Degree of Unsaturation. Finally, I will list the critical points of the analysis and select the correct option from the original list provided in the question.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Analyze Spectroscopic Data for Fragments**:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two proton signals implies a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group**: The specific 1H NMR signals (doublet and doublet of quartets) are a classic pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which has a formula of `C3H5`. This also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group**: The FTIR confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The second methyl signal, combined with the crucial information that there are no `-CH2-` groups, indicates the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). This fragment contributes `C2H3O2`.\n2.  **Assemble Fragments and Calculate Formula**: Sum the atoms from the identified fragments (`C6H4`, `C3H5`, and `C2H3O2`) to get the final molecular formula.\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: Calculate the DoU from the derived formula and compare it to the DoU expected from the structural features (aromatic ring, one C=C bond, one C=O bond) to ensure consistency. This also helps eliminate incorrect options.\n4.  **Identify Careful Points**: Summarize the most important logical steps and potential pitfalls, such as the importance of the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the reason for discrepancies in the candidate answers.\n5.  **Select Final Answer**: Compare the derived formula to the given options (A, B, C, D) to identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the chemical formula of an unknown compound by analyzing spectroscopic data,\n    summarizing the reasoning, and selecting the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options as provided in the original question\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing Spectroscopic Data to Identify Molecular Fragments\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    # Fragment 1: Aromatic Ring\n    fragment_ring = {\"C\": 6, \"H\": 4, \"O\": 0}\n    print(f\"- A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 2 proton signals implies a symmetrical C6H4 fragment.

A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para) substitution.

It is the deciding factor in eliminating C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n*   **Specific NMR Patterns:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" as a propenyl group is a major shortcut to the correct structure.\n*   **DoU as a Filter:** Calculating the DoU for all options is an efficient first step to quickly eliminate incorrect formulas.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly deduced the formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their prompts, not flawed chemical logic. This provides very high confidence in the derived formula.\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe problem provides several pieces of spectroscopic data that act as clues to the molecule's structure. We can identify the fragments one by one:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" For a di-substituted ring with four protons, having only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct –CH₃ signals but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a –CH₂– group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can calculate the total molecular formula:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl):** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and Eliminate Alternatives\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. (Possible, but see below)\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n\nThis check eliminates options A and D. We are left with C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂. However, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ contains one more carbon and two more hydrogens than our derived formula, which corresponds to an extra -CH₂- group. The data explicitly states there are **no -CH₂- groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint** is the most critical piece of information for solving this problem. It is essential for correctly identifying the ester fragment and for eliminating option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂), which otherwise has the correct degree of unsaturation.\n*   **The ¹H NMR splitting pattern** for the vinyl group (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is a specific signature that unambiguously identifies the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n*   **Systematic fragment analysis** is the most reliable method. Identifying each piece (C₆H₄, C₃H₅, C₂H₃O₂) and summing them prevents errors.\n*   **Mapping the final formula to the options** requires careful attention. The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe derived chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a systematic breakdown of the original question, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from FTIR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern (likely para) on a benzene ring that has four protons. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, critically, \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n    *   One methyl group is accounted for by the propenyl fragment.\n    *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To satisfy the \"no -CH₂-\" constraint, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl part)\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O) atoms:** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structural Features:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6** (Matches)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6** (Matches)\n\nThis calculation eliminates options B and C, leaving A and D as possibilities.\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination Using All Constraints\n\nWe must now distinguish between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (Option A) and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D).\n*   Our fragment analysis in Step 2 unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ differs from C₁₁H₁₂O₂ by one carbon and two hydrogens, which is equivalent to an additional **-CH₂- group**.\n*   The problem statement explicitly says there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This information definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **NMR Splitting Patterns:** The identification of the propenyl group from the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" vinyl signals is a key step that is correctly identified in all candidate answers.\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint is the most critical piece of information for the final decision, as it allows for the elimination of C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Candidate Answer Discrepancies:** The provided candidate answers almost unanimously derive the correct formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) through sound chemical reasoning. The variation in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to inconsistent mapping of the formulas to the letters, not a flaw in the chemical analysis itself.\n*   **Systematic Approach:** Combining DoU calculations with detailed fragment analysis provides a robust method for solving this type of problem.\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a systematic breakdown of the chemical evidence, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data and Structural Fragments\n\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is to break down the molecule into fragments based on the provided spectroscopic data. This approach is sound and leads to the following deductions:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" strongly implies a symmetrically substituted C₆H₄ fragment. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for the 2 oxygen atoms in the formula and contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region are a classic and unambiguous signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula C₃H₅ and accounts for 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and a C=C double bond.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct -CH₃ signals. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. The crucial piece of information is that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This means the ester cannot be, for example, an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes C₂H₃O₂ to the overall formula (1 carbonyl carbon, 1 methyl carbon, 3 methyl hydrogens, and 2 oxygens).\n\n### Step 2: Assembling the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula. This calculation was performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a check for the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n\nThe DoU values match, confirming that the derived formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision and Analysis of Careful Points\n\nThe derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, corresponds to option **C**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Negative Evidence is Key:** The statement \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is the most critical piece of information for distinguishing between formulas with the same DoU. For example, C12H14O2 also has a DoU of 6, but it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to C11H12O2, and is therefore ruled out.\n*   **Recognizing NMR Patterns:** The identification of the propenyl group from its unique \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" splitting pattern is essential for a correct fragment analysis.\n*   **Mapping Errors:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical deduction was unanimously correct (all derived C₁₁H₁₂O₂), many failed in the final step of matching this formula to the correct letter from the original prompt's list. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final answer against the provided options.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct chemical reasoning, the molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" For a di-substituted ring with four protons, two signals imply symmetry, which strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula and contributes one degree of unsaturation (C=O bond).\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.

The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **Crucial Constraint:** The spectrum has **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. For the ester to contain the second methyl group without introducing a -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃).

In either case, the atoms contributed by the ester carbonyl, the two oxygens, and the second methyl group sum to **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    By combining the identified fragments, we can determine the total atom count:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU is a check for the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **From the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\n    The values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched to the options provided in the original question:\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n\n    The correct formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"No -CH₂- groups\" constraint is the most critical piece of information.** This piece of negative evidence is essential for distinguishing between possible structures. It definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (which has the same DoU of 6 but contains an extra -CH₂- group) and also eliminates other ester types like ethyl esters.\n*   **The ¹H NMR splitting pattern for the vinyl group is a specific signature.** A \"doublet and a doublet of quartets\" is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) and is a more reliable piece of information than just \"vinyl signals.\"\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a powerful first check.** Calculating the DoU for the structural features (6) and for the formula options quickly eliminates choices C11H14O2 (DoU=5) and C12H12O2 (DoU=7).\n*   **Fragment analysis must be complete.** All signals described in the spectra must be accounted for. Summing the atoms from the `C₆H₄` ring, the `C₃H₅` propenyl group, and the `C₂H₃O₂` ester/methyl fragment leads directly to the correct formula.\n*   **Mapping the derived formula to the options requires care.** As seen in the candidate answers, all agents correctly derived the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂, but many failed to select the correct letter (D) because they may have assumed a different order for the options. The final step must always be to check the derived answer against the original list of options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a systematic breakdown of the question, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the number of rings and pi bonds. We can calculate the required DoU from the structural information provided:\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 pi bonds, giving a DoU of 4.\n    *   An ester group (-COO-) contains one C=O pi bond, adding 1 to the DoU.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C pi bond, adding another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total required DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.**\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for each option:** We can now check which of the given formulas has a DoU of 6 using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (This is a possible answer).\n    *   **B) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (This is incorrect).\n    *   **C) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (This is incorrect).\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (This is a possible answer).\n    This initial analysis eliminates options B and C.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Fragments:** To distinguish between options A and D, we must build the molecule from the fragments described by the NMR and FTIR data.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" implies a symmetrical, para-substituted ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" are a classic pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**. This also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Ester and Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The second -CH₃ signal must belong to this group. The crucial constraint is that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**. This means the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃), not an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). This fragment's formula is **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** We sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ + C₃H₅ + C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2\n    *   The molecular formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:** The derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A. We can now definitively rule out option D (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). While it has the correct DoU, it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure, which directly contradicts the NMR data stating there are no –CH₂ groups.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus on Analysis:** All 15 candidate answers correctly deduce the chemical formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The chemical reasoning is unanimously sound.\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue for solving the problem. It is the key to distinguishing between the two options (A and D) that have the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **NMR Splitting Patterns:** Recognizing that a \"doublet and a doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region is a classic signature for a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers were due to them referencing different or scrambled lists of options. The final answer must be mapped back to the specific list provided in the original question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. Having only two signals indicates symmetry, most likely a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct –CH₃ signals but, critically, **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To include this methyl group without introducing a –CH₂ group (which would be present in, for example, an ethyl ester -COOCH₂CH₃), it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can calculate the molecular formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester and methyl part)\n*   **Carbon (C) Count:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) Count:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O) Count:** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a useful check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds in the structure.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6 DoU`.\nThe values match perfectly, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a valid formula for the described structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Select the Final Answer\n\nThe final step is to match our derived formula with the options provided in the question:\nA) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5)\nB) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7)\nC) **C11H12O2 (DoU = 6)**\nD) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6)\n\nOur derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option C. We can also definitively rule out option D. While C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has the correct DoU of 6, it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure. The problem explicitly states there are **no –CH₂ groups**, making option D incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **¹H NMR Splitting Patterns:** The \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" for the vinyl protons is a highly specific pattern that strongly indicates a propenyl group. Recognizing this pattern is key to solving the problem.\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The statement \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It is not just descriptive; it is a constraint that actively eliminates other possible structures and formulas.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** Calculating the DoU for the options is a fast and effective way to eliminate choices that are fundamentally inconsistent with the structural information (aromatic ring, C=C, C=O).\n*   **Mapping to Options:** As seen in the candidate answers, a common source of error is incorrectly mapping the correctly derived formula to the given letter choices. It is essential to carefully check the provided list of options before making a final selection.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers and the original question, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from FTIR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy into the constituent parts of the molecule. This reasoning was consistently applied across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR spectrum strongly indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, most likely a 1,4- (para) substituted pattern. This core fragment has the formula **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (**-COO-**), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region are a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **Absence of Methylene Groups:** The statement that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"** is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any other structure containing a methylene bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the molecular formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall chemical formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester + Methyl Fragment:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion was unanimously reached in the chemical analysis portion of all 15 candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds in the structure.\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**`.\n\nThe DoU values match perfectly, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a valid formula for the described structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Decision\n\nThe final step is to match the derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, with the options provided in the question.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5)\n*   B) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6)\n*   **C) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6)**\n*   D) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7)\n\nOur derived formula matches option C. We can also definitively rule out option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂), even though it has the correct DoU, because it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure, which is explicitly contradicted by the \"no –CH₂ groups\" information from the NMR spectrum.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue for solving the puzzle correctly. It eliminates many potential structures and is the key to distinguishing between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n*   **¹H NMR Splitting Patterns:** Recognizing that a \"doublet and a doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region is a classic signature for a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment.\n*   **Consensus vs. Clerical Errors:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these four protons strongly implies a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para). This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula and one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct –CH₃ signals but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**. One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a –CH₂– group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This means the fragment is either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula.\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a useful check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds in the structure.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Formulas (DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n\nThis calculation eliminates options C and D. We must now distinguish between A and B.\n\n### Step 4: Final Elimination and Selection\nOur detailed fragment analysis led to the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The other remaining option, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, has one more carbon and two more hydrogens, which corresponds to an extra -CH₂- group. The problem explicitly states there are **no -CH₂- groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Positive Evidence:** The specific ¹H NMR splitting pattern (doublet and doublet of quartets) is a key piece of positive evidence that strongly points to a propenyl group.\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The absence of –CH₂– signals is a critical piece of negative evidence that eliminates many potential structures, including the C₁₂H₁₄O₂ option.\n*   **DoU as a Filter:** Calculating the DoU is an excellent first step to quickly filter out impossible options, but it often leaves some ambiguity that must be resolved with more detailed spectral analysis.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** As seen in the candidate answers, a common mistake is to perform the chemical analysis correctly but then select the wrong letter from the multiple-choice list. It is crucial to carefully match the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the correct option letter.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:** The first step is to translate the information from FTIR and ¹H NMR into the building blocks of the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" This indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, which has a core formula of **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (**-COO-**).

To include this methyl group without introducing a methylene (-CH₂-) group (which would be present in, for example, an ethyl ester -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃). Both of these possibilities contribute a **C₂H₃O₂** fragment to the overall formula.\n\n2.  **Assemble Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:** By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula.\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester and methyl part)\n    *   **Carbon (C) count:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H) count:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O) count:** **2**\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a check for the total number of rings and π-bonds, which must be consistent between the structure and the formula.\n    *   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **DoU from Formula Options:**\n        *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n        *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n        *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n        *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n\n4.  **Final Elimination and Decision:** The DoU calculation narrows the possibilities to C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂. The fragment analysis from the NMR data provides the deciding factor. Our detailed analysis constructed the molecule with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The alternative, C₁₂H₁₄O₂, contains one more carbon and two more hydrogens, which corresponds to an extra -CH₂- group. The problem explicitly states there are **no -CH₂- groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂. Therefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue for solving the puzzle. It allows for the direct elimination of C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct degree of unsaturation.\n*   **Vinyl Splitting Pattern:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" as the signature of a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment.\n*   **Consensus vs. Clerical Error:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The variation in their final letter choices was due to inconsistent ordering of the options, not a flaw in their scientific reasoning.\n*   **Systematic Approach:** The most reliable method is to first build the formula from the fragments and then use the DoU as a verification step, rather than relying on DoU alone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the chemical analysis into logical steps, mirroring the consensus reasoning found in the candidate answers. I will deduce the molecular fragments from the spectroscopic data, assemble them to find the molecular formula, and then verify this formula using the Degree of Unsaturation. Finally, I will list the critical points of the analysis and select the correct option from the original list provided in the question.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Analyze Spectroscopic Data for Fragments**:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two proton signals implies a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group**: The specific 1H NMR signals (doublet and doublet of quartets) are a classic pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which has a formula of `C3H5`. This also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group**: The FTIR confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The second methyl signal, combined with the crucial information that there are no `-CH2-` groups, indicates the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). This fragment contributes `C2H3O2`.\n2.  **Assemble Fragments and Calculate Formula**: Sum the atoms from the identified fragments (`C6H4`, `C3H5`, and `C2H3O2`) to get the final molecular formula.\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: Calculate the DoU from the derived formula and compare it to the DoU expected from the structural features (aromatic ring, one C=C bond, one C=O bond) to ensure consistency. This also helps eliminate incorrect options.\n4.  **Identify Careful Points**: Summarize the most important logical steps and potential pitfalls, such as the importance of the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the reason for discrepancies in the candidate answers.\n5.  **Select Final Answer**: Compare the derived formula to the given options (A, B, C, D) to identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the chemical formula of an unknown compound by analyzing spectroscopic data,\n    summarizing the reasoning, and selecting the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options as provided in the original question\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing Spectroscopic Data to Identify Molecular Fragments\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    # Fragment 1: Aromatic Ring\n    fragment_ring = {\"C\": 6, \"H\": 4, \"O\": 0}\n    print(f\"- A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 2 proton signals implies a symmetrical C6H4 fragment.

A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para) substitution. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula and contributes one degree of unsaturation (C=O bond).\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups. It also contributes one degree of unsaturation (C=C bond).\n    *   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\". One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a -CH₂- group (like in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This means the fragment is either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can find the total molecular formula:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU is a check for the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   **From Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **From Derived Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6 DoU`.\n    The values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural data.\n\n4.  **Compare with Given Options:**\n    The final step is to match our derived formula with the options provided in the question.\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option **B**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Vinyl Splitting Pattern:** The \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" is a highly specific pattern that is key to identifying the propenyl group.\n*   **\"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This is the most critical piece of negative evidence.

For example, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ also has a DoU of 6, but it contains an extra -CH₂- group compared to C₁₁H₁₂O₂, making it incorrect.\n*   **Symmetry:** The two signals for four aromatic protons strongly imply a symmetrical para-substituted ring, which is consistent with the overall structure.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The Degree of Unsaturation calculation is an essential check to ensure the derived formula is plausible and to quickly eliminate incorrect options.\n\nThe analysis of all spectroscopic data points unambiguously to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting important considerations.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments**\n\nThe most effective way to solve this problem is to break down the spectroscopic information into smaller, identifiable molecular fragments and then assemble them.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons.

It is the deciding factor in eliminating C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n*   **Specific NMR Patterns:** Recognizing the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" as a propenyl group is a major shortcut to the correct structure.\n*   **DoU as a Filter:** Calculating the DoU for all options is an efficient first step to quickly eliminate incorrect formulas.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly deduced the formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their prompts, not flawed chemical logic. This provides very high confidence in the derived formula.\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe problem provides several pieces of spectroscopic data that act as clues to the molecule's structure. We can identify the fragments one by one:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" For a di-substituted ring with four protons, having only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical, 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct –CH₃ signals but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a –CH₂– group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can calculate the total molecular formula:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl):** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and Eliminate Alternatives\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. (Possible, but see below)\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n\nThis check eliminates options A and D. We are left with C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂. However, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ contains one more carbon and two more hydrogens than our derived formula, which corresponds to an extra -CH₂- group. The data explicitly states there are **no -CH₂- groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint** is the most critical piece of information for solving this problem. It is essential for correctly identifying the ester fragment and for eliminating option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂), which otherwise has the correct degree of unsaturation.\n*   **The ¹H NMR splitting pattern** for the vinyl group (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is a specific signature that unambiguously identifies the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n*   **Systematic fragment analysis** is the most reliable method. Identifying each piece (C₆H₄, C₃H₅, C₂H₃O₂) and summing them prevents errors.\n*   **Mapping the final formula to the options** requires careful attention. The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe derived chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a systematic breakdown of the original question, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from FTIR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR spectrum shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern (likely para) on a benzene ring that has four protons. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, critically, \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"\n    *   One methyl group is accounted for by the propenyl fragment.\n    *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To satisfy the \"no -CH₂-\" constraint, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the complete molecular formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl part)\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O) atoms:** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structural Features:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6** (Matches)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6** (Matches)\n\nThis calculation eliminates options B and C, leaving A and D as possibilities.\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination Using All Constraints\n\nWe must now distinguish between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (Option A) and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D).\n*   Our fragment analysis in Step 2 unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ differs from C₁₁H₁₂O₂ by one carbon and two hydrogens, which is equivalent to an additional **-CH₂- group**.\n*   The problem statement explicitly says there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This information definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **NMR Splitting Patterns:** The identification of the propenyl group from the \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" vinyl signals is a key step that is correctly identified in all candidate answers.\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint is the most critical piece of information for the final decision, as it allows for the elimination of C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which otherwise has the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **Candidate Answer Discrepancies:** The provided candidate answers almost unanimously derive the correct formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) through sound chemical reasoning. The variation in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to inconsistent mapping of the formulas to the letters, not a flaw in the chemical analysis itself.\n*   **Systematic Approach:** Combining DoU calculations with detailed fragment analysis provides a robust method for solving this type of problem.\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a systematic breakdown of the chemical evidence, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data and Structural Fragments\n\nThe consensus among all candidate answers is to break down the molecule into fragments based on the provided spectroscopic data. This approach is sound and leads to the following deductions:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" strongly implies a symmetrically substituted C₆H₄ fragment. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for the 2 oxygen atoms in the formula and contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region are a classic and unambiguous signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula C₃H₅ and accounts for 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and a C=C double bond.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct -CH₃ signals. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. The crucial piece of information is that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This means the ester cannot be, for example, an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes C₂H₃O₂ to the overall formula (1 carbonyl carbon, 1 methyl carbon, 3 methyl hydrogens, and 2 oxygens).\n\n### Step 2: Assembling the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula. This calculation was performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part)\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a check for the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n\nThe DoU values match, confirming that the derived formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision and Analysis of Careful Points\n\nThe derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, corresponds to option **C**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Negative Evidence is Key:** The statement \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is the most critical piece of information for distinguishing between formulas with the same DoU. For example, C12H14O2 also has a DoU of 6, but it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to C11H12O2, and is therefore ruled out.\n*   **Recognizing NMR Patterns:** The identification of the propenyl group from its unique \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" splitting pattern is essential for a correct fragment analysis.\n*   **Mapping Errors:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical deduction was unanimously correct (all derived C₁₁H₁₂O₂), many failed in the final step of matching this formula to the correct letter from the original prompt's list. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final answer against the provided options.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct chemical reasoning, the molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" For a di-substituted ring with four protons, two signals imply symmetry, which strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula and contributes one degree of unsaturation (C=O bond).\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a -CH₂- group (like in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the total molecular formula.\n*   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Summing the atoms:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) and Eliminate Options\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a powerful check.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n\nThis check eliminates options B and C. We are left with A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂). Our fragment analysis already derived C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ contains an extra CH₂ group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n*   **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers correctly deduce the molecular formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The chemical reasoning is unanimous and sound.\n*   **Key Information:** The most critical pieces of information were the specific splitting pattern of the vinyl protons (identifying the propenyl group) and the absence of -CH₂- signals (defining the ester structure and eliminating C₁₂H₁₄O₂).\n*   **Mapping Errors:** Many candidate answers, despite having the correct chemical analysis, selected the wrong final letter. This is because they used a different ordering of the multiple-choice options in their internal processing.\n*   **Conclusion:** The detailed analysis of all spectroscopic data points unambiguously to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Matching this to the provided options:\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying key points for a robust conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from FTIR and ¹H NMR into the building blocks of the molecule.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" For a di-substituted ring with four protons, having only two signals strongly implies a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para). This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula and one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups.\" One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **Crucial Constraint:** The spectrum has **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. For the ester to contain the second methyl group without introducing a -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula. This approach was unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl):** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a powerful tool to check for consistency between the formula and the structure.\n*   **DoU from Structural Features:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Candidate Formulas (using DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   **C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6**\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n\nThis calculation immediately eliminates options B and D. We are left with A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and C (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision and Careful Points\n\nWe must now distinguish between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n*   Our detailed fragment analysis, based on every piece of NMR data, perfectly constructs the molecule with the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has one more carbon and two more hydrogens than C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to an extra **-CH₂- group**.\n*   The problem explicitly states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups,\"** which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Negative Evidence is Key:** The absence of -CH₂- signals is as important as the signals that are present. It is the deciding factor in eliminating C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n*   **NMR Splitting Patterns:** Recognizing the specific \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" pattern as a propenyl group is fundamental to solving the problem correctly.\n*   **Consensus in Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers, despite sometimes choosing the wrong final letter due to different option ordering, correctly deduced the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ through their chemical analysis. This provides very high confidence in the result.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The final step is to carefully match the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe correct formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting key points.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe most effective way to solve this problem is to translate each piece of spectroscopic information into a corresponding molecular fragment.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR spectrum strongly indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring. This fragment's formula is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the final formula and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region are a classic, unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl (-CH₃) signals. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. The crucial piece of information is that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**. This means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any other type with a methylene bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula. This approach was used correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl part):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n**Summing the atoms:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a useful check to ensure the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Derived Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n\nThe DoU values match, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a valid formula for the described structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Decision\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched with the options provided in the original question:\n\nA) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 7, incorrect)\nB) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (DoU = 6, correct)**\nC) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 6, but has an extra CH₂ group, incorrect)\nD) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DoU = 5, incorrect)\n\nThe only formula that has the correct DoU (6) and is consistent with the fragment analysis (specifically, the absence of -CH₂- groups) is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers\n\n*   **Consensus on Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and unanimously concluded that the molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This shows high confidence in the scientific reasoning.\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Rule:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue for distinguishing between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂, which both have the same DoU of 6.

The chemical deduction itself is sound across all answers.\n\nBased on the robust and unanimous chemical analysis, the correct formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step deduction of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which for the four protons on such a ring, strongly implies a symmetrical 1,4- (para) substitution pattern.

The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To avoid creating a -CH₂- group (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, the atoms contributed by the ester carbonyl, the two oxygens, and the second methyl group sum to **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    By combining the identified fragments, we can determine the total atom count:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU is a check for the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   **From the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6 DoU**.\n    The values match, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched to the options provided in the original question:\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n\n    The correct formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"No -CH₂- groups\" constraint is the most critical piece of information.** This piece of negative evidence is essential for distinguishing between possible structures. It definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (which has the same DoU of 6 but contains an extra -CH₂- group) and also eliminates other ester types like ethyl esters.\n*   **The ¹H NMR splitting pattern for the vinyl group is a specific signature.** A \"doublet and a doublet of quartets\" is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) and is a more reliable piece of information than just \"vinyl signals.\"\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a powerful first check.** Calculating the DoU for the structural features (6) and for the formula options quickly eliminates choices C11H14O2 (DoU=5) and C12H12O2 (DoU=7).\n*   **Fragment analysis must be complete.** All signals described in the spectra must be accounted for. Summing the atoms from the `C₆H₄` ring, the `C₃H₅` propenyl group, and the `C₂H₃O₂` ester/methyl fragment leads directly to the correct formula.\n*   **Mapping the derived formula to the options requires care.** As seen in the candidate answers, all agents correctly derived the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂, but many failed to select the correct letter (D) because they may have assumed a different order for the options. The final step must always be to check the derived answer against the original list of options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and a systematic breakdown of the question, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the number of rings and pi bonds. We can calculate the required DoU from the structural information provided:\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 pi bonds, giving a DoU of 4.\n    *   An ester group (-COO-) contains one C=O pi bond, adding 1 to the DoU.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C pi bond, adding another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total required DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.**\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for each option:** We can now check which of the given formulas has a DoU of 6 using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (This is a possible answer).\n    *   **B) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (This is incorrect).\n    *   **C) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7.

(This is a possible answer).\n    This initial analysis eliminates options B and C.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Fragments:** To distinguish between options A and D, we must build the molecule from the fragments described by the NMR and FTIR data.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" implies a symmetrical, para-substituted ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" are a classic pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**. This also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Ester and Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The second -CH₃ signal must belong to this group. The crucial constraint is that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**. This means the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃), not an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). This fragment's formula is **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** We sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ + C₃H₅ + C₂H₃O₂\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2\n    *   The molecular formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:** The derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A. We can now definitively rule out option D (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). While it has the correct DoU, it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure, which directly contradicts the NMR data stating there are no –CH₂ groups.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus on Analysis:** All 15 candidate answers correctly deduce the chemical formula to be C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The chemical reasoning is unanimously sound.\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue for solving the problem. It is the key to distinguishing between the two options (A and D) that have the correct Degree of Unsaturation.\n*   **NMR Splitting Patterns:** Recognizing that a \"doublet and a doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region is a classic signature for a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers were due to them referencing different or scrambled lists of options. The final answer must be mapped back to the specific list provided in the original question.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. Having only two signals indicates symmetry, most likely a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Methylene Constraint:** The spectrum shows two distinct –CH₃ signals but, critically, **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. To include this methyl group without introducing a –CH₂ group (which would be present in, for example, an ethyl ester -COOCH₂CH₃), it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can calculate the molecular formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester and methyl part)\n*   **Carbon (C) Count:** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) Count:** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O) Count:** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a useful check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds in the structure.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DoU) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 ester C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6 DoU`.\nThe values match perfectly, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a valid formula for the described structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Select the Final Answer\n\nThe final step is to match our derived formula with the options provided in the question:\nA) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5)\nB) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7)\nC) **C11H12O2 (DoU = 6)**\nD) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6)\n\nOur derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option C. We can also definitively rule out option D. While C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has the correct DoU of 6, it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure. The problem explicitly states there are **no –CH₂ groups**, making option D incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **¹H NMR Splitting Patterns:** The \"doublet and doublet of quartets\" for the vinyl protons is a highly specific pattern that strongly indicates a propenyl group. Recognizing this pattern is key to solving the problem.\n*   **Negative Evidence:** The statement \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It is not just descriptive; it is a constraint that actively eliminates other possible structures and formulas.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** Calculating the DoU for the options is a fast and effective way to eliminate choices that are fundamentally inconsistent with the structural information (aromatic ring, C=C, C=O).\n*   **Mapping to Options:** As seen in the candidate answers, a common source of error is incorrectly mapping the correctly derived formula to the given letter choices. It is essential to carefully check the provided list of options before making a final selection.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers and the original question, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from FTIR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy into the constituent parts of the molecule. This reasoning was consistently applied across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR spectrum strongly indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, most likely a 1,4- (para) substituted pattern. This core fragment has the formula **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (**-COO-**), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region are a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **Absence of Methylene Groups:** The statement that there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"** is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any other structure containing a methylene bridge. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the molecular formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall chemical formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester + Methyl Fragment:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion was unanimously reached in the chemical analysis portion of all 15 candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a check to ensure the formula is consistent with the number of rings and pi bonds in the structure.\n\n*   **DoU from Structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**`.\n\nThe DoU values match perfectly, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a valid formula for the described structure.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Decision\n\nThe final step is to match the derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, with the options provided in the question.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5)\n*   B) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6)\n*   **C) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6)**\n*   D) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7)\n\nOur derived formula matches option C. We can also definitively rule out option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂), even though it has the correct DoU, because it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived structure, which is explicitly contradicted by the \"no –CH₂ groups\" information from the NMR spectrum.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This piece of negative evidence is the most critical clue for solving the puzzle correctly. It eliminates many potential structures and is the key to distinguishing between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n*   **¹H NMR Splitting Patterns:** Recognizing that a \"doublet and a doublet of quartets\" in the vinyl region is a classic signature for a propenyl group is essential for correctly identifying the C₃H₅ fragment.\n*   **Consensus vs. Clerical Errors:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to errors in mapping their correct result to the specific list of options provided in the prompt, not due to flawed scientific reasoning.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
