  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\nA) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\nB) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\nC) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\nD) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore essential for identification.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the two complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We must find a single molecule that contains protons that would give rise to *both* of the following signals:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each structure, as they are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting. We will use the lettering from the original question.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's label the key protons on the main chain: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    *   **Conclusion: This structure is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ on C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule can produce a `dtt` signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a single proton, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtq` signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Decision**\n\n1.  **FTIR Confirmation**: The FTIR data is crucial for identifying the carboxylic acid functional group but cannot distinguish between the isomers.\n2.  **NMR Specificity**: The ¹H NMR splitting patterns are highly specific. The key to this problem is realizing that a single molecule must be able to produce *both* the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals.\n3.  **Systematic Evaluation**: Each candidate must be checked for both signal types. Options B, C, and D can each produce one of the required signals, but not both.\n4.  **Correct Mapping**: It is essential to map the correct chemical analysis to the corresponding lettered option from the original question. Several of the provided agent answers performed the chemical analysis correctly but failed at this final step, leading to an incorrect letter choice.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis, only structure **A** contains two different methine protons with the correct neighboring environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, taking into account the provided candidate answers and identifying the key points for a correct decision.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the infrared spectroscopy data.\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data reliably identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information confirms the class of compound but does not distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore decisive.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns. The correct structure must contain protons in environments that produce *both* of the described signals.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex signal arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This signal arises when a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   A second, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing another **t**riplet split.\n\n### **Step 3: Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nA careful point is to strictly adhere to the lettering provided in the question and analyze each structure's potential to produce both signals. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's analyze the two key methine (CH) protons in this structure: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H, giving a **d**oublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, giving a **t**riplet), and the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H, giving a **q**uartet). This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H, giving a **d**oublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, giving a **t**riplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl substituent (2H, giving another **t**riplet). This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure is the only one that accounts for both observed complex signals.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has the correct neighbors to produce a `dtq` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, this molecule cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that only one structure, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, contains protons in two distinct chemical environments that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. According to the options provided in the question, this structure corresponds to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The main goal is to identify the correct chemical structure out of four options, based on provided FTIR and 1H NMR data. I need to analyze the reasoning from 15 candidate answers, synthesize a correct, step-by-step logical path, and present it within a single Python code block that prints the explanation and the final answer.\n\n2.  **Initial Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **FTIR:** A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ are textbook signals for a carboxylic acid (O-H stretch and C=O stretch, respectively). I check the four options: A, B, C, and D are all carboxylic acids. This confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the isomers. The NMR data is therefore the deciding factor.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The most crucial information is the presence of two specific, complex signals:\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   I must find the *single* molecule that contains protons in two different environments that would produce *both* of these signals.\n\n3.  **Decoding the NMR Splitting Patterns:** I apply the (n+1) rule for spin-spin splitting. For a signal to be split into multiple multiplicities (like `dtq`), the proton must be coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   1 neighboring proton (n=1, gives a **d**oublet).\n        *   2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a **t**riplet).\n        *   3 equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, gives a **q**uartet).\n    *   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   1 neighboring proton (n=1, gives a **d**oublet).\n        *   2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a **t**riplet).\n        *   Another, chemically different set of 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives another **t**riplet).\n\n4.  **Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure:** I will now analyze the methine (CH) protons in each of the four options provided in the prompt, as these are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n    *   **A) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n        *   However, this molecule does not have a proton coupled to one H and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt`. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt**.\n        *   However, this molecule does not have a proton with 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. It cannot produce a `dtq`. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **C) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n        *   However, this molecule cannot produce a `dtt`. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **D) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure. I'll number the main chain starting from the COOH group: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`. This naming is incorrect as the longest chain is a pentanoic acid. The correct structure is `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's analyze the protons on this correct structure.\n        *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to the H at C3 (1H, giving a **d**oublet), the CH₃ at C5 (3H, giving a **q**uartet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, giving a **t**riplet). This combination results in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n        *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to the H at C4 (1H, giving a **d**oublet), the CH₂ at C2 (2H, giving a **t**riplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl substituent (2H, giving another **t**riplet). This combination results in a **dtt**. This matches the second signal.\n        *   **This option is correct** because it is the only one that can produce both required signals.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Based on the rigorous analysis, option D is the only structure consistent with all the data. I will now structure this logic into the requested Python code block. The code will use `print` statements to explain each step of the reasoning, leading to the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR)\n    to determine the correct chemical structure from the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\")\n    print(\" - A very broad absorption at 3000 cm-1 indicates the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\" - A strong absorption at 1700 cm-1 indicates the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n*   **Careful Point:** The most critical part of the analysis is to correctly interpret the complex splitting patterns and find a single molecule that can produce both.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the compound is saturated (no C=C double bonds), which is true for all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex signal arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons.

Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n*   **Careful Point:** Systematically analyze the methine (CH) protons in each structure to see if they can produce both of the required signals.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H).

This would produce a **dtq**. However, this molecule does not have a proton that can produce a `dtt`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    Let's label the key protons on the carbon backbone, numbering from the COOH group:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**.\n        2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet**.\n        3.

Analyze the FTIR Data**\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic O-H stretching vibration from a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all choices but does not help distinguish between them. The ¹H NMR data is essential for the final identification.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns**\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the two complex signals reported. We must find a single molecule that can produce both patterns. The splitting of a signal is described by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. For a proton coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighbors, the multiplicities are multiplied.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which causes the **d**oublet splitting.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which causes the **t**riplet splitting.\n    *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which causes the **q**uartet splitting.\n    *   **Structural Requirement:** We need to find a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another `-CH-` group, a `-CH₂-` group, and a `-CH₃` group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **d**oublet splitting.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the first **t**riplet splitting.\n    *   A second, non-equivalent group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the second **t**riplet splitting.\n    *   **Structural Requirement:** We need to find a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another `-CH-` group and two different `-CH₂-` groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Candidate Structures**\nWe will now systematically analyze each structure to see if it meets both structural requirements. The methine (CH) protons are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt`. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H).

It cannot produce a `dtq`. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ on C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt`. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's label the key protons in the structure, numbering the main chain from the COOH group:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        This combination produces a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n        This combination produces a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nStructure D is the only candidate that contains protons in two distinct chemical environments that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Careful Points & Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Interpretation**: All candidate answers correctly interpret the FTIR data.\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a definitive signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid.

The ¹H NMR data is the deciding factor. A rigorous analysis of the expected splitting patterns shows that structures A, B, and C can each produce only one of the two required complex signals, but not both. Only structure D, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, contains two different protons whose neighboring environments perfectly match the requirements to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis task requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and ¹H NMR) to identify the correct chemical structure from the four given options. The consensus among the provided answers is strong, but a careful, step-by-step verification is necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data reliably confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information verifies the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore decisive.\n\n### **Step 2: Deconstruction of ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the two complex signals reported. A single molecule must contain protons in two different chemical environments that produce both of these patterns.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex signal arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This signal arises when a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   A second, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing another **t**riplet split.\n\n### **Step 3: Systematic Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nWe will now analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each structure to see if they can produce both of the required signals.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a set of 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's label the key protons on the carbon backbone, numbering from the COOH group:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure is the only one that correctly accounts for both complex signals.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **FTIR is Confirmatory, Not Differentiating:** The FTIR data is crucial for identifying the carboxylic acid functional group but cannot distinguish between the isomers. The problem's solution hinges entirely on the NMR data.\n2.  **Both Signals are Required:** The correct structure must explain the presence of *both* the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals. Structures A, B, and C can each explain one of the signals, but not both, which disqualifies them.\n3.  **Correct Structural Analysis:** The analysis depends on correctly identifying the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons for the two different methine (CH) protons in the molecule's backbone.\n4.  **Consistency Across Candidate Answers:** While some candidate answers mislabeled the final letter choice (e.g., calling structure D \"A\" or \"C\"), their underlying chemical analysis was overwhelmingly consistent and pointed to the same molecule: `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`. This structure corresponds to option D in the question prompt.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nA rigorous analysis of the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for each molecule shows that only structure D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, contains protons that would generate both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. Therefore, it is the only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis task requires a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical structure from the four given options.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a definitive signature of an O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) bond, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of the FTIR Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the information from the FTIR spectrum.\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, which participates in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore essential for identification.\n\n### **2.

The single proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n            2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n            3.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**.\n            This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n        *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The single proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n            2.

Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Data**:\n    *   A broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data**:\n    *   The absence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the molecule is saturated (no C=C bonds), which is true for all options.\n    *   The key to the identification lies in the two complex splitting patterns. We must find a single molecule that contains protons in environments that would produce *both* signals.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This requires a proton to have three distinct sets of neighbors: one single proton (for the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (for the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (for the quartet).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This requires a proton to have three distinct sets of neighbors: one single proton (for the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (for the first triplet), and a second, non-equivalent group of two equivalent protons (for the second triplet).\n\n### **2. Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the methine (CH) protons in each of the four options as defined in the question.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   This structure cannot produce a `dtq` signal because no methine proton is adjacent to a methyl group.\n    *   **Result: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H).

Proton H(b) at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.

The peak is significantly broadened due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information is consistent with all choices but does not distinguish between them. The ¹H NMR data is therefore essential for identification.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex spin-spin splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We must find a single molecule that contains protons that would give rise to *both* of the following signals:\n\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex pattern arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   A second, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n### **3.

This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    This structure is the only one that can satisfy both conditions. Let's label the key protons on the main chain, numbering from the COOH group:\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.

The analysis shows that only one structure, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, contains protons in two distinct environments that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum (a `dtq` and a `dtt`).\n\nBased on the original question's list, the formula for 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid is **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Careful Points & Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data reliably confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information is confirmatory but does not distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore the key to solving the problem.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Data Deconstruction:**\n    *   The problem states there are no \"vinyl-hydrogens,\" which confirms the compound is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds). This is consistent with all four options.\n    *   The crucial information lies in the two complex splitting patterns (multiplicities). The correct structure must contain protons in two different chemical environments that can produce *both* of these signals.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex signal arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which causes the **d**oublet split.\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, e.g., a -CH₂- group), which causes the **t**riplet split.\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, e.g., a -CH₃ group), which causes the **q**uartet split.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This signal arises from a different proton that is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **d**oublet split.\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, a -CH₂- group), causing a **t**riplet split.\n        *   A second, non-equivalent group of two neighboring protons (n=2, another -CH₂- group), causing another **t**riplet split.\n\n3.  **Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure:**\n    We will analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each structure, as they are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal. However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal. However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a combination of 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal. However, this molecule lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure, numbering the main chain from the COOH group:\n        `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The single proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n            2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n            3.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**.\n            This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n        *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The single proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n            2.  The two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n            3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n            This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that has the specific molecular structure required to produce both a `dtq` signal (from the proton at C4) and a `dtt` signal (from the proton at C3). Therefore, it is the only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that only one structure, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, contains protons in two distinct chemical environments that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. According to the options provided in the question, this structure corresponds to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The main goal is to identify the correct chemical structure out of four options, based on provided FTIR and 1H NMR data. I need to analyze the reasoning from 15 candidate answers, synthesize a correct, step-by-step logical path, and present it within a single Python code block that prints the explanation and the final answer.\n\n2.  **Initial Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **FTIR:** A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ are textbook signals for a carboxylic acid (O-H stretch and C=O stretch, respectively). I check the four options: A, B, C, and D are all carboxylic acids. This confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the isomers. The NMR data is therefore the deciding factor.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The most crucial information is the presence of two specific, complex signals:\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   I must find the *single* molecule that contains protons in two different environments that would produce *both* of these signals.\n\n3.  **Decoding the NMR Splitting Patterns:** I apply the (n+1) rule for spin-spin splitting. For a signal to be split into multiple multiplicities (like `dtq`), the proton must be coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   1 neighboring proton (n=1, gives a **d**oublet).\n        *   2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a **t**riplet).\n        *   3 equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, gives a **q**uartet).\n    *   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   1 neighboring proton (n=1, gives a **d**oublet).\n        *   2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a **t**riplet).\n        *   Another, chemically different set of 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives another **t**riplet).\n\n4.  **Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure:** I will now analyze the methine (CH) protons in each of the four options provided in the prompt, as these are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n    *   **A) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n        *   However, this molecule does not have a proton coupled to one H and two different CH₂ groups.

I'll number the main chain starting from the COOH group: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`. This naming is incorrect as the longest chain is a pentanoic acid. The correct structure is `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's analyze the protons on this correct structure.\n        *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to the H at C3 (1H, giving a **d**oublet), the CH₃ at C5 (3H, giving a **q**uartet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, giving a **t**riplet).

Analysis of FTIR Data**\n*   **Careful Point:** The first step is to interpret the functional groups indicated by the FTIR spectrum.\n*   **Broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information is consistent with all choices but does not help distinguish between them. The ¹H NMR data is therefore the deciding factor.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n*   **Careful Point:** The most critical part of the analysis is to correctly interpret the complex splitting patterns and find a single molecule that can produce both.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the compound is saturated (no C=C double bonds), which is true for all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex signal arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons. Based on the (n+1) rule:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (n=3).\n    *   **Structural Requirement:** We need to find a methine proton (-CH-) that is adjacent to another -CH- group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This signal arises when a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to **one** neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupled to a second, non-equivalent set of **two** neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Structural Requirement:** We need to find a methine proton (-CH-) that is adjacent to another -CH- group and two different -CH₂- groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n*   **Careful Point:** Systematically analyze the methine (CH) protons in each structure to see if they can produce both of the required signals.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**. However, this molecule does not have a proton that can produce a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt**. However, this molecule does not have a proton that can produce a `dtq`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**. However, this molecule does not have a proton that can produce a `dtt`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    Let's label the key protons on the carbon backbone, numbering from the COOH group:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**.\n        2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet**.\n        3.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**.\n        2.  The two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**.\n        3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nStructure D is the only candidate that contains two different protons whose neighboring environments precisely match the requirements to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound.\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic O-H stretching vibration from a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all choices but does not help distinguish between them. The ¹H NMR data is essential for the final identification.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns**\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the two complex signals reported. We must find a single molecule that can produce both patterns. The splitting of a signal is described by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. For a proton coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighbors, the multiplicities are multiplied.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which causes the **d**oublet splitting.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which causes the **t**riplet splitting.\n    *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which causes the **q**uartet splitting.\n    *   **Structural Requirement:** We need to find a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another `-CH-` group, a `-CH₂-` group, and a `-CH₃` group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **d**oublet splitting.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the first **t**riplet splitting.\n    *   A second, non-equivalent group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the second **t**riplet splitting.\n    *   **Structural Requirement:** We need to find a methine proton (`-CH-`) that is adjacent to another `-CH-` group and two different `-CH₂-` groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Candidate Structures**\nWe will now systematically analyze each structure to see if it meets both structural requirements. The methine (CH) protons are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt`. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. It cannot produce a `dtq`. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ on C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. It cannot produce a `dtt`. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's label the key protons in the structure, numbering the main chain from the COOH group:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        This combination produces a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → **quartet**\n        This combination produces a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nStructure D is the only candidate that contains protons in two distinct chemical environments that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Careful Points & Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Interpretation**: All candidate answers correctly interpret the FTIR data.\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a definitive signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. This confirms the functional group is present but does not help distinguish between the four isomers, as all are carboxylic acids. The decision must be based on the ¹H NMR data.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Splitting Pattern Deconstruction**: The core of the problem is to correctly interpret the complex splitting patterns and match them to a single structure that can produce both.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This signal arises from a single proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which causes the **d**oublet split.\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the **t**riplet split.\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing the **q**uartet split.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This signal arises from a different proton that is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **d**oublet split.\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n        *   A second, non-equivalent group of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another **t**riplet split.\n    *   **Key Requirement**: The correct molecule must contain two different protons, one that produces a `dtq` and another that produces a `dtt`.\n\n3.  **Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**: It is critical to analyze each structure to see if it can produce *both* required signals. We will analyze the methine (CH) protons, as they are the most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n        *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one proton and two different CH₂ groups.

This matches the other observed signal.\n        *   **Result: Correct.** This is the only structure that accounts for both complex signals.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe FTIR data confirms a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data is the deciding factor. A rigorous analysis of the expected splitting patterns shows that structures A, B, and C can each produce only one of the two required complex signals, but not both. Only structure D, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, contains two different protons whose neighboring environments perfectly match the requirements to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis task requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and ¹H NMR) to identify the correct chemical structure from the four given options. The consensus among the provided answers is strong, but a careful, step-by-step verification is necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data reliably confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information verifies the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore decisive.\n\n### **Step 2: Deconstruction of ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the two complex signals reported. A single molecule must contain protons in two different chemical environments that produce both of these patterns.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex signal arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This signal arises when a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   A second, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing another **t**riplet split.\n\n### **Step 3: Systematic Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nWe will now analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each structure to see if they can produce both of the required signals.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H).

The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.

The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure is the only one that correctly accounts for both complex signals.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **FTIR is Confirmatory, Not Differentiating:** The FTIR data is crucial for identifying the carboxylic acid functional group but cannot distinguish between the isomers. The problem's solution hinges entirely on the NMR data.\n2.  **Both Signals are Required:** The correct structure must explain the presence of *both* the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals. Structures A, B, and C can each explain one of the signals, but not both, which disqualifies them.\n3.  **Correct Structural Analysis:** The analysis depends on correctly identifying the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons for the two different methine (CH) protons in the molecule's backbone.\n4.  **Consistency Across Candidate Answers:** While some candidate answers mislabeled the final letter choice (e.g., calling structure D \"A\" or \"C\"), their underlying chemical analysis was overwhelmingly consistent and pointed to the same molecule: `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`. This structure corresponds to option D in the question prompt.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nA rigorous analysis of the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for each molecule shows that only structure D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, contains protons that would generate both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. Therefore, it is the only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis task requires a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical structure from the four given options.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a definitive signature of an O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) bond, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

The significant broadness is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, which participates in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore essential for identification.\n\n### **2.

This matches the other observed signal.\n    *   **Result: Correct.** This is the only structure that produces both required signals.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   This structure cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   **Result: Incorrect.**\n\n### **3. Analysis of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\n*   **Consensus on Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly deduce that the molecule must be **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid** (`CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`) because it is the only structure that contains protons capable of producing both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal.\n*   **Error in Labeling**: The majority of the candidate answers (13 out of 15) correctly identify the required chemical structure but incorrectly map it to the letter \"D\" or \"A\". A careful check of the options provided in the question shows that `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` corresponds to option **C**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The chemical reasoning across all provided answers is sound and points to a single structure. The discrepancy lies in correctly labeling that structure with the letter provided in the multiple-choice options. Based on a rigorous analysis, the correct structure is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the infrared spectroscopy data.\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is significantly broadened due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information is consistent with all choices but does not distinguish between them. The ¹H NMR data is therefore essential for identification.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex spin-spin splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We must find a single molecule that contains protons that would give rise to *both* of the following signals:\n\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex pattern arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   A second, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nWe will now systematically evaluate each candidate structure. A critical point is that the correct structure must account for **both** the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a combination of 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, this molecule lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    This structure is the only one that can satisfy both conditions. Let's label the key protons on the main chain, numbering from the COOH group:\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n\n    *   **Analysis of the proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.  The single proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n        2.  The two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that has the specific molecular structure required to produce both a `dtq` signal (from the proton at C4) and a `dtt` signal (from the proton at C3). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a rigorous step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical structure from the four options. The consensus among the provided answers is that the identification hinges on correctly interpreting the complex ¹H NMR splitting patterns.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Analysis**:\n    *   A broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The FTIR data reliably confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this information verifies the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data is therefore the deciding factor.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Splitting Pattern Deconstruction**:\n    The key to solving the problem is to find a single molecule that contains protons in two different chemical environments that would produce *both* of the following complex signals. The splitting is governed by the n+1 rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This complex signal arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n        *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₂- group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n        *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (e.g., a -CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This signal arises when a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n        *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n        *   A second, chemically distinct set of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group, n=2), causing another **t**riplet split.\n\n3.  **Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**:\n    We must analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each structure, as they are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal. However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a combination of 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors, so it cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal. However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one proton and two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal. However, this molecule cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**: Let's analyze the two different methine protons in this structure, numbering the main chain from the COOH group:\n        `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The single proton at C3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n            2.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n            3.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**.\n            This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the first signal.\n        *   **Proton at C3**: This proton is coupled to:\n            1.  The single proton at C4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**.\n            2.  The two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n            3.  The two protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ attached to C3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**.\n            This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching the second signal.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical reasoning presented in the candidate answers is overwhelmingly consistent and correct. The analysis shows that only one structure, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, contains protons in two distinct environments that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum (a `dtq` and a `dtt`).\n\nBased on the original question's list, the formula for 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid is **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Careful Points & Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.
