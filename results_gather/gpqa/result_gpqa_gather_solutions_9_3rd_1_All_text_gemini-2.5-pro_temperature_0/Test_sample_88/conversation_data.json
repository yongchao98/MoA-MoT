The reaction conditions are harsh (strong base, high temperature), which suggests a non-standard reaction like a skeletal rearrangement, especially since a simple elimination is forbidden by Bredt's rule.\n    *   The IR spectrum of Product 1 shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a classic indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum is the most critical piece of data. The total integration is 14 protons, meaning the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region and is highly characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** To have a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O (Degree of Unsaturation = 4) and contain both a ketone (1 DU) and a double bond (1 DU), the carbon skeleton must account for the remaining 2 degrees of unsaturation. This means the skeleton must be **bicyclic**. The original tricyclic adamantane cage must have undergone a ring-opening reaction. The known reaction for this substrate under these conditions is a **Grob fragmentation**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Product 1:** The only structure that fits all the evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard **reductive ozonolysis**, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH). In Product 3, the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded. This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, which places its signal significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm).\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This is a critical feature.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the four neighboring protons can be divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are also equivalent to each other.\n    *   **Splitting:** The coupling constant between H-C3 and Set A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant between H-C3 and Set B (J_B). Therefore, the signal for H-C3 is split by two different sets of equivalent protons.\n        *   Coupling to the two equivalent protons of Set A (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1=3).\n        *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B (n=2), resulting in another **triplet**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The final, observable coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   The IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons, meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The most crucial piece of data is the ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The presence of both a ketone and a double bond in a C₁₀H₁₄O molecule means the original tricyclic adamantane cage must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement to a bicyclic system. The reaction is a known Grob fragmentation.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only structure that fits all the provided data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. All candidate answers correctly identify this structure.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol and does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. All candidate answers correctly identify this structure.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O) at position C7.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. All candidate answers correctly identify this structure.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, this is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the hydrogen on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom.\n*   **Analyze the Coupling Environment:**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups, meaning H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, these four neighbors can be grouped into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    5.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and Set A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant between H-C3 and Set B (J_B).\n*   **Determine the Splitting Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule, the signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent protons of Set A (n=2) into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) triplet\nB) pentet\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct analysis leads to a \"triplet of triplets\".\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this multi-step organic chemistry problem by carefully analyzing each reaction and the provided spectroscopic data. I will deduce the structure of each intermediate product (1, 2, and 3) and then analyze the final product's NMR spectrum to determine the correct coupling pattern.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Deduce the structure of Product 1.** I will analyze the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with hot KOH. The key clues are the IR peak for a ketone and the ¹H NMR signal for an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂). This points towards a skeletal rearrangement (Grob fragmentation) rather than a simple substitution or elimination.\n2.  **Step 2: Deduce the structure of Product 2.** I will identify the reaction of Product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide as a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the double bond.\n3.  **Step 3: Deduce the structure of Product 3.** I will identify the reaction of Product 2 with ozone followed by dimethylsulfide as a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond to form a new ketone.\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.** I will identify the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in the final structure. Then, I will determine its coupling pattern by considering the molecule's symmetry and the number of neighboring protons, applying the n+1 rule for each set of equivalent neighbors.\n5.  **Step 5: Select the final answer.** I will match the determined coupling pattern to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis\n    and determines the coupling pattern for the final product's NMR spectrum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1\n    # Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH, 240C -> Product 1\n    # Data: IR at 1720 cm-1 (ketone), 1H NMR with a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H, vinylic).\n    # Analysis: The harsh conditions and spectral data point to a Grob fragmentation.\n    # The adamantane cage opens to form a bicyclic system.\n    product_1 = \"7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2\n    # Reaction: Product 1 + aluminum isopropoxide -> Product 2\n    # Analysis: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n    # It selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the double bond untouched.\n    product_2 = \"7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3\n    # Reaction: Product 2 + O3, then DMS -> Product 3\n    # Analysis: This is a reductive ozonolysis.

These are harsh conditions that suggest a rearrangement, not a simple substitution or elimination (which is forbidden by Bredt's rule).\n*   **Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR: The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The key signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The ketone and double bond account for two, meaning the remaining structure must be bicyclic (two rings). This confirms the adamantane (tricyclic) cage has opened. The only structure that fits all the data (bicyclic, ketone, exocyclic double bond, and is a known product of this reaction) is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**, formed via a Grob fragmentation.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. It selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic =CH₂ group is converted to a ketone at C7. The alcohol at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom?\n*   **Identify the Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the alcohol (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the electronegativity of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n*   **Analyze Coupling:**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  Due to the symmetry, these four neighbors can be grouped into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   Set 1: The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Set 2: The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    5.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    6.  According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first set of two equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    7.  Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second set of two equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.

The most critical piece of data is the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n4.  **Structural Deduction:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, the molecule must be bicyclic (possessing two rings). This confirms that the original tricyclic adamantane skeleton has undergone a ring-opening reaction. The only structure that fits all the evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**, which is the known product of a Grob fragmentation reaction under these conditions.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at low temperature, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond. The dimethylsulfide works up the intermediate to yield carbonyl compounds without further oxidation.\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** The exocyclic double bond (=CH₂) at position C7 is cleaved to form a ketone. The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged. The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded. This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, which shifts its signal significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm).\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This is a critical point for determining proton equivalence.\n    *   **Neighboring Protons:** The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.

Coupling to the two equivalent protons of Set A (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1=3). Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The final, observable coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C.\n2.  **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.

The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Analyzing All Spectroscopic Data.**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which means the product has the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The most crucial signal is at **4.79 ppm (2H)**. This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons, and the integration of 2H strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and a C₁₀H₁₄ formula, the original tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic (two-ring) system. A known reaction for this substrate under these conditions is a **Grob fragmentation**. This pathway leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is the only one that is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the Reaction Type.** This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones and aldehydes to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone group at position C3 of Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Identifying the Reaction Type.** This is a **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The DMS serves as a mild reducing agent in the workup to convert the intermediate ozonide into carbonyl compounds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The exocyclic double bond (=CH₂) at position C7 is cleaved. This converts the C7 carbon into a ketone (=O). The alcohol group at C3 remains unaffected. The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton.** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, **H-C3**) is the most deshielded. This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, which shifts its signal significantly downfield compared to all other non-exchangeable protons.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Analyzing the Coupling Pattern based on Symmetry.**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Because of the symmetry, the coupling environment of the two protons on C2 is identical to that of the two protons on C4.\n    4.  Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    5.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and Set A (J_axial) will be different from the coupling constant between H-C3 and Set B (J_equatorial).\n    6.  According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the two equivalent protons of Set A (n=2) splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet**.\n    7.  Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B (n=2), resulting in another **triplet**.\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n    *   **Analysis of Data:** The provided spectroscopic data is crucial. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the formation of a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is a definitive indicator of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The total proton count of 14 (C₁₀H₁₄O) means the adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system to accommodate both a ketone and a double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction is a Grob fragmentation, a known rearrangement for this system under these conditions. The structure that uniquely fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. All candidate answers that performed a detailed analysis correctly identified this structure.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This step was also correctly identified by all candidates.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is converted into a ketone (=O). The alcohol at C3 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. This conclusion was also unanimous among the candidates.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    *   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, this is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. The electronegativity of the oxygen atom shifts this proton significantly downfield, more so than the protons alpha to the ketone.\n    *   **Analyze the Coupling Environment:**\n        *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This makes the two sides of the molecule equivalent.\n        *   **Neighbors:** The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so there are four neighboring protons in total.\n        *   **Equivalence:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling relationship to H-C3 as the two protons on C4. Furthermore, in the stable chair-chair conformation, these four neighbors can be divided into two distinct sets:\n            1.  A set of two equivalent *axial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n            2.  A set of two equivalent *equatorial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Splitting Pattern:** Since the coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-type protons (J_ax) is different from the coupling constant with the equatorial-type protons (J_eq), the signal is split sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) gives a triplet (n+1=3). Each line of this triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), resulting in another triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical transformations consistently lead to bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. The analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum shows that the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton (H-C3) is coupled to two different pairs of equivalent protons.

The reaction conditions are harsh (strong base, high temperature), which suggests a non-standard reaction like a skeletal rearrangement, especially since a simple elimination is forbidden by Bredt's rule.\n    *   The IR spectrum of Product 1 shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a classic indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum is the most critical piece of data. The total integration is 14 protons, meaning the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region and is highly characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** To have a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O (Degree of Unsaturation = 4) and contain both a ketone (1 DU) and a double bond (1 DU), the carbon skeleton must account for the remaining 2 degrees of unsaturation. This means the skeleton must be **bicyclic**. The original tricyclic adamantane cage must have undergone a ring-opening reaction.

The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with hot KOH, combined with the spectral data (IR: 1720 cm-1, NMR: 4.79 ppm), indicates that Product 1 is 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one.\n2. The MPV reduction of Product 1 yields Product 2: 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.\n3. The ozonolysis of Product 2 yields the final product, Product 3: bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n4. In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the carbinol proton at position C3.\n5. This proton (H-C3) is coupled to two different sets of two equivalent protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C4).\n6. This coupling results in a 'triplet of triplets' splitting pattern.\n\nMatching the result to the given choices:\nA) doublet of triplets\nB) triplet of triplets\nC) pentet\nD) triplet\n\nThe correct choice corresponding to a 'triplet of triplets' is B.\n<<<B>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions that suggest a rearrangement, not a simple substitution or elimination (which is forbidden by Bredt's rule).\n*   **Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR: The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The key signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The ketone and double bond account for two, meaning the remaining structure must be bicyclic (two rings). This confirms the adamantane (tricyclic) cage has opened. The only structure that fits all the data (bicyclic, ketone, exocyclic double bond, and is a known product of this reaction) is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**, formed via a Grob fragmentation.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. It selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic =CH₂ group is converted to a ketone at C7. The alcohol at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom?\n*   **Identify the Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the alcohol (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the electronegativity of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n*   **Analyze Coupling:**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  Due to the symmetry, these four neighbors can be grouped into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   Set 1: The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Set 2: The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    5.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    6.  According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first set of two equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    7.  Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second set of two equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nctrl95>H\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and spectroscopic problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C.\n2.  **Analysis of Conditions:** The use of a strong base at high temperature on a rigid cage-like structure, where standard elimination is disfavored by Bredt's rule, strongly suggests a skeletal rearrangement.\n3.  **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive sign of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which matches the number of hydrogens in the starting material, indicating a molecular formula of C₁₀H₁₄O. The most critical piece of data is the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n4.  **Structural Deduction:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, the molecule must be bicyclic (possessing two rings). This confirms that the original tricyclic adamantane skeleton has undergone a ring-opening reaction. The only structure that fits all the evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**, which is the known product of a Grob fragmentation reaction under these conditions.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at low temperature, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond. The dimethylsulfide works up the intermediate to yield carbonyl compounds without further oxidation.\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** The exocyclic double bond (=CH₂) at position C7 is cleaved to form a ketone. The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged. The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded. This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, which shifts its signal significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm).\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This is a critical point for determining proton equivalence.\n    *   **Neighboring Protons:** The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, meaning H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, these four neighbors are not all equivalent. They form two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting:** The signal for H-C3 is split by two sets of protons with different coupling constants (J_axial and J_equatorial). Coupling to the two equivalent protons of Set A (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1=3). Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The final, observable coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C.\n2.  **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The most crucial signal is at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** The combination of a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, a ketone, and a C=C double bond requires the molecule to have four degrees of unsaturation. The ketone and double bond account for two, meaning the remaining two must come from a bicyclic (two-ring) structure. This confirms that the original tricyclic adamantane cage has undergone a ring-opening rearrangement. The reaction is a known Grob fragmentation.\n4.  **Conclusion for Product 1:** The only structure that fits all the experimental data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, this is the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). It is deshielded by the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom, shifting it significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm).\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the four neighboring protons are grouped into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   Set A: The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Set B: The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting:** The coupling constant between H-C3 and the protons in Set A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant with the protons in Set B (J_B). Applying the n+1 rule sequentially:\n        *   Coupling to the two equivalent protons in Set A (n=2) splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons in Set B (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The most critical piece of information is the signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)**. This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The adamantane skeleton is tricyclic. To accommodate both a ketone and a double bond while maintaining a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O, the carbon skeleton must be bicyclic (Degree of Unsaturation = 2 for rings + 1 for C=O + 1 for C=C = 4 total). The harsh reaction conditions are known to induce a skeletal rearrangement called a **Grob fragmentation**.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The only structure that fits all the evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard **reductive ozonolysis**, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7.

This reaction opens the tricyclic adamantane cage to form a bicyclic system.\n*   **Structure Identification:** The structure that fits all the evidence—the reaction type, the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, the ketone IR peak, and the exocyclic methylene NMR signal—is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. All the provided candidate answers correctly deduce this structure, establishing a strong consensus.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. All candidate answers are in agreement on this step.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. Again, all candidate answers correctly identify this final product.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n*   **Analyzing the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one has a plane of symmetry that passes through atoms C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups.\n    3.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are also equivalent to each other.\n    4.

Matching this with the provided options:\nA) triplet\nB) triplet of triplets\nC) pentet\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n2.  **Analysis of Data:** The starting material is a rigid, tricyclic compound. The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) and the inability to perform a standard E2 elimination (due to Bredt's rule) strongly suggest a skeletal rearrangement. The spectroscopic data for Product 1 is key:\n    *   **IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This confirms the presence of a ketone (C=O).\n    *   **¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H):** This is the most definitive piece of data, indicating the presence of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   **Total proton count of 14H:** This implies the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and a C₁₀H₁₄ formula, the tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic (two-ring) system. The only structure that fits all the evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**, which is the known product of a Grob fragmentation of this system. All candidate answers converge on this correct intermediate.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone at position C7. The alcohol at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Structural Deduction:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, this is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group. The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton significantly more than any other proton on the carbon framework.\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling Environment:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, these four neighbors are not all equivalent. They form two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set 1:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Set 2:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are also equivalent to each other.\n    *   The coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-like protons (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant between H-C3 and the equatorial-like protons (J_B).\n3.  **Determine the Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   The coupling to the first set of two equivalent protons (n=2) splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second set of two equivalent protons (n=2), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and spectroscopic problem.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions that promote skeletal rearrangements, as simple elimination is disfavored by Bredt's rule in the rigid adamantane cage.\n*   **Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The most crucial signal is at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is 4. The ketone (1 DoU) and the double bond (1 DoU) account for two degrees. The remaining two degrees must come from a bicyclic (two-ring) system. This confirms that the original tricyclic adamantane cage has undergone a ring-opening reaction. The only structure that fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**, which is the known product of a Grob fragmentation under these conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction chemoselectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone at C7. The alcohol at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, which shifts its signal significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm).\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  **Neighbors:** The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n    3.  **Equivalence:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are also equivalent to each other.\n    4.  **Splitting:** The coupling constant between H-C3 and the protons of Set A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant with the protons of Set B (J_B).

The reaction conditions are harsh (strong base, high temperature). A standard elimination reaction to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. Therefore, a skeletal rearrangement is expected.\n*   **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The most crucial piece of information is the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons, and the integration strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and a C₁₀H₁₄ formula, the original tricyclic adamantane skeleton must have opened to form a bicyclic (two-ring) system. The known reaction under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation, which leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group.

It cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, which shifts its signal significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm).\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the four neighboring protons can be divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4). These are also equivalent to each other.\n    5.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and the protons in Set A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the protons in Set B (J_B).\n    6.  According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the two equivalent protons in Set A (n=2) splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet**.\n    7.  Each line of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons in Set B (n=2), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    8.  The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) pentet\nB) triplet\nC) doublet of triplets\nD) triplet of triplets\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpreting the Reaction Conditions.** The starting material is a rigid, tricyclic cage. A standard elimination reaction to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high heat) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpreting the Spectroscopic Data.** This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   The IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ clearly indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons, meaning the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is a definitive sign of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, the molecule must be bicyclic (having two rings). The only chemically plausible reaction that opens the adamantane cage and produces a product consistent with all the spectral data is a **Grob fragmentation**.

The structure of the resulting product, Product 1, must be deduced from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpreting the Reaction Conditions.** The starting material is a rigid, tricyclic cage molecule with bromine atoms at bridgehead positions. A standard E2 elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Analyzing All Spectroscopic Data.**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total proton count is 14 (2H + 10H + 2H), which means the product has the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O.

This structure is the only one that is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the Reaction Type.** This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones and aldehydes to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone group at position C3 of Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Identifying the Reaction Type.** This is a **reductive ozonolysis**.

This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom, which shifts its signal significantly downfield compared to all other non-exchangeable protons.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Analyzing the Coupling Pattern based on Symmetry.**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Because of the symmetry, the coupling environment of the two protons on C2 is identical to that of the two protons on C4.\n    4.

The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the formation of a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is a definitive indicator of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The total proton count of 14 (C₁₀H₁₄O) means the adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system to accommodate both a ketone and a double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction is a Grob fragmentation, a known rearrangement for this system under these conditions. The structure that uniquely fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. All candidate answers that performed a detailed analysis correctly identified this structure.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for the reduction of ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This step was also correctly identified by all candidates.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is converted into a ketone (=O). The alcohol at C3 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. This conclusion was also unanimous among the candidates.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    *   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. In Product 3, this is the carbinol proton (H-C3), the hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. The electronegativity of the oxygen atom shifts this proton significantly downfield, more so than the protons alpha to the ketone.\n    *   **Analyze the Coupling Environment:**\n        *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. This makes the two sides of the molecule equivalent.\n        *   **Neighbors:** The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so there are four neighboring protons in total.\n        *   **Equivalence:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling relationship to H-C3 as the two protons on C4. Furthermore, in the stable chair-chair conformation, these four neighbors can be divided into two distinct sets:\n            1.  A set of two equivalent *axial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n            2.  A set of two equivalent *equatorial-type* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Splitting Pattern:** Since the coupling constant between H-C3 and the axial-type protons (J_ax) is different from the coupling constant with the equatorial-type protons (J_eq), the signal is split sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) gives a triplet (n+1=3). Each line of this triplet is then split again by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2), resulting in another triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical transformations consistently lead to bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. The analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum shows that the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton (H-C3) is coupled to two different pairs of equivalent protons.
