  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)\n\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct steps from the provided answers and identifying key points.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nThis step is foundational and was performed correctly by all agents.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This calculation is straightforward and establishes the necessary parameters for the rest of the problem.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments is 3 GeV. This value is used in both the classical and relativistic calculations.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis calculation provides the baseline value for comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Due to conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta. In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁`.\n    2.  Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The classical approximation yields a simple integer result, 1 GeV.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The relativistic kinetic energy is slightly higher than the classical one for the more massive fragment. This is because for a given momentum, a more massive object has less kinetic energy, but the relativistic correction alters this simple inverse relationship.\n\n### **Step 5: Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert units.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows a consistent and robust calculation across all provided methods, leading to a numerical result of 5 MeV. The confusion in the candidate answers arises from incorrectly mapping this numerical result to the lettered options. Based on the question's options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference of 5 MeV corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, taking into account the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of a fission fragment calculated using relativistic mechanics versus classical mechanics. All candidate answers follow the same fundamental steps to solve this.\n\n**1. Calculation of Fragment Properties**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relations:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   By substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum, we get `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which leads to `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    *   The rest-mass energies are therefore:\n        *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the mass defect, converted to kinetic energy.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis part of the calculation is performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n\n**2. Classical Kinetic Energy (T₁_classical)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy Formula:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV` and `T₂ = 2T₁`, we get `3T₁ = 3 GeV`, which means `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\nThis calculation is also consistent and correct across all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T₁_relativistic)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation:** `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁`\n    *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nThis crucial step is also performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Difference**\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT₁ = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Converting from GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n    *   `ΔT₁ = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n1.  **Calculation Consistency:** All candidate answers that show their work arrive at the same numerical result: **5 MeV**. The physics and the mathematical steps are sound and verified.\n2.  **Unit Conversion:** The final conversion from GeV to MeV is a necessary step that all candidates performed correctly.\n3.  **Mapping to Options:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers is incorrectly mapping the calculated result of 5 MeV to the provided options (A, B, C, D). The prompt clearly lists the options as:\n    *   A) 2 MeV\n    *   B) 20 MeV\n    *   C) 10 MeV\n    *   D) 5 MeV\n\nThe calculated result of 5 MeV directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve the problem by first determining the physical quantities of the system and then calculating the required kinetic energies. I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish Initial Values**: Define the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (`Mc²`) as 300 GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Properties**: Using the given relationships (`m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`), I will calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`).\n3.  **Determine Q-value**: I will calculate the total kinetic energy released in the fission (the Q-value) by finding the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical T₁**: I will find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using the non-relativistic (classical) approximation. In this approximation, kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to the mass.\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic T₁**: I will find the correct kinetic energy (`T₁`) using the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum. The relativistic energy-momentum relation `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` is key here.\n6.  **Compute the Difference**: I will calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T₁`.\n7.  **Final Answer**: I will convert the result to MeV and select the corresponding option from the provided list.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result. The main source of discrepancy among the candidates is incorrectly mapping the final numerical answer (5 MeV) to the given multiple-choice letters. My code will perform the calculation from first principles to confirm the numerical result and then select the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fission_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy\n    for a fission fragment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish Initial Values\n    Mc2_GeV = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\n    \n    # The options provided in the question\n    options = {'A': 20, 'B': 5, 'C': 10, 'D': 2}\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate Fragment Properties\n    # From the problem statement: m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99*M.\n    # This implies 3*m2 = 0.99*M, so m2 = 0.33*M and m1 = 0.66*M.\n    m1c2_GeV = 0.66 * Mc2_GeV\n    m2c2_GeV = 0.33 * Mc2_GeV\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy Released)\n    # Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy\n    Q_GeV = Mc2_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate Classical T1\n    # In classical mechanics, from conservation of momentum, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2.\n    # So, T2 = 2*T1.\n    # Since T1 + T2 = Q, we have T1 + 2*T1 = Q, which means 3*T1 = Q.\n    T1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / 3.0\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate Relativistic T1\n    # From conservation of momentum (p1=p2), we have the relativistic relation:\n    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2\n    # Substitute T2 = Q - T1:\n    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c^2\n    # Expanding and simplifying this equation leads to:\n    # T1 * (2*m1c^2 + 2*m2c^2 + 2*Q) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c^2\n    # A simpler form is T1 * 2 * Mc^2 = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)\n    T1_relativistic_GeV = (Q_GeV * (Q_GeV + 2 * m2c2_GeV)) / (2 * Mc2_GeV)\n    \n    # Step 6: Compute the Difference\n    difference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n    \n    # Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\n    difference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n    \n    # Step 7: Final Answer\n    print(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (Mc^2): {Mc2_GeV} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Fragment 1 rest-mass energy (m1c^2): {m1c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Fragment 2 rest-mass energy (m2c^2): {m2c2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q): {Q_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"The difference is {difference_GeV:.4f} GeV, which is {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV.\")\n    \n    # Find the matching option\n    final_choice = None\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        if math.isclose(value, difference_MeV, rel_tol=1e-5):\n            final_choice = choice\n            break\n            \n    print(f\"The calculated difference of {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV matches option {final_choice}.\")\n    print(f\"The final answer is {final_choice}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_fission_problem()\n\n# Final Answer format\nprint(\"<<<B>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Initial rest-mass energy (Mc^2): 300.0 GeV\nFragment 1 rest-mass energy (m1c^2): 198.00 GeV\nFragment 2 rest-mass energy (m2c^2): 99.00 GeV\nTotal kinetic energy released (Q): 3.00 GeV\n----------------------------------------\nClassical T1: 1.0000 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.0050 GeV\n----------------------------------------\nThe difference is 0.0050 GeV, which is 5.0 MeV.\nThe calculated difference of 5.0 MeV matches option B.\nThe final answer is B\n<<<B>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, followed by the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n    *   The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   It splits into two fragments, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂`.\n    *   We are given two relationships:\n        1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n        2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n    *   We can solve this system of equations. Substitute the first into the second: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    *   From this, we find `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n    *   Now, we calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n        *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n    *   The energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n    *   **Careful Point:** In both classical and relativistic mechanics, conservation of momentum dictates that since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n    *   The classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n        *   `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n        *   `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n        *   `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n        *   `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. A more direct formula relating kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments:\n        *   `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n    *   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁` (all in GeV).\n        *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   Expand the equation:\n        *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then group the remaining terms:\n        *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        *   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n        *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   Solving for the correct relativistic kinetic energy:\n        *   `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference**\n    *   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The final answer must be in MeV. Convert the result: `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, we need to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m₁` (the more massive) and `m₂`.\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Sum of Masses:** We are also given that the sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nFrom this, we can find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2m₂ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNow, we can calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁c²`): `0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂c²`): `0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted entirely into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.\n\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### **3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   `T₁,class = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂,class = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\nSince `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class = 1 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics. The relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, the relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite (`p₁ = p₂ = p`). Therefore, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\nWe can express `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nEquating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁`. We substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n`Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the methods and identifying key points from the provided answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of a fission fragment calculated using relativistic mechanics versus classical mechanics. This requires a careful application of conservation laws in both frameworks.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\nThis initial step was performed correctly and consistently by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment) and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   By substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation, we get `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which leads to `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step was also performed consistently and correctly by all candidates.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we substitute the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the classical kinetic energy is `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nThis is the most complex step, but the candidate answers correctly apply relativistic principles, arriving at the same result through two valid methods.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The key equation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Since the momenta are equal, we can set `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    Substituting the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out, and simplifying the equation gives:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Difference**\n\nThis final step requires subtracting the classical value from the correct relativistic value and converting the units.\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT₁ = T₁,correct - T₁,class = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Calculation Consistency:** All provided answers that show detailed work correctly calculate the numerical difference to be **5 MeV**. This high level of agreement confirms the result.\n2.  **Formulas:** The distinction between the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` is critical and was handled correctly.\n3.  **Main Source of Error:** The discrepancy among the final answers is not in the calculation itself, but in mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the multiple-choice letters (A, B, C, D). Several candidate answers seem to refer to a different set of options than the one provided in the prompt.\n4.  **Final Decision:** Based on the robust and unanimously confirmed calculation, the correct numerical answer is 5 MeV. According to the options provided in the question (`A) 10 MeV, B) 20 MeV, C) 5 MeV, D) 2 MeV`), this corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals that while the underlying calculations are overwhelmingly correct, there is significant confusion in mapping the final numerical result to the correct multiple-choice letter. A careful, step-by-step verification is necessary to determine the correct final answer based on the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis is the foundational step and is calculated correctly in all detailed answers.\n*   **Given:** Initial rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The fragments have masses `m₁` and `m₂` such that `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for masses:** Substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the mass defect, `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step is also performed consistently and correctly.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step, but the candidate answers correctly apply relativistic principles.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since `E = T + mc²`, this can be written as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThis is the final calculation.\n*   **Difference = T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical**\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Conversion to MeV:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   The numerical calculation is robust. Every detailed analysis arrives at the same physical quantities: `m₁c²=198 GeV`, `m₂c²=99 GeV`, `Q=3 GeV`, `T₁,classical=1 GeV`, and `T₁,relativistic=1.005 GeV`.\n*   The final numerical difference is unambiguously **5 MeV**.\n*   The primary source of error in the candidate answers is mapping this numerical result to the provided options. The options given in the question are:\n    *   A) 2 MeV.\n    *   B) 5 MeV.\n    *   C) 20 MeV.\n    *   D) 10 MeV.\n*   The calculated value of 5 MeV corresponds directly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct steps from the provided answers and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### **1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nThis step is foundational and was performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship between fragments: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of fragment masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for `m₂`: `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    3.  Solve for `m₁`: `m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 0.66M`.\n    4.  Convert these mass relationships into rest-mass energies:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments. This step was also performed correctly by all candidates.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis calculation provides the baseline value for comparison.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The key principle is the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n    3.  Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    4.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    6.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the correct application of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds. However, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E = T + mc²` is the total energy.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  From the energy-momentum relation, we can express momentum as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n    2.  Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for the two fragments: `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    3.  An alternative, as used by most candidates, is to express `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy: `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    4.  Equating the momenta gives: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    5.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    6.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    7.  `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    8.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel.\n    9.  `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    10. `600T₁ = 603`\n    11. `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and ensure the units are correct.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The options are in MeV, while the calculations were done in GeV. A conversion is necessary (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁,correct - T₁,class`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct elements from the provided answers and identifying crucial points.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem and Initial Values**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify all the given information and the objective.\n*   **Initial Nucleus:** Rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. It is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Fission Fragments:** Two fragments, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Mass Relationships:**\n    *   `m₁ = 2m₂`\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated with relativistic mechanics (`T₁_correct`) and classical mechanics (`T₁_classical`). The result should be in MeV.\n    *   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step involves solving the system of equations for the fragment masses and then finding their corresponding rest-mass energies. This was done correctly by all agents.\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies using `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, we use the conservation of momentum and the classical formula for kinetic energy.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_class / T₂_class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_class:** Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics. The agents demonstrated two valid methods, both leading to the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using Kinetic Energy and Momentum Relation**\n*   The relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can set their squared values equal: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms cancel. `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`.\n    *   `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Method 2: Using Total Energy and Momentum Relation**\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²` implies `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n*   Rearranging: `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n*   `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198)² - (99)² = 29403`.\n*   `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = 29403` => `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`.\n*   Solving the system `E₁ + E₂ = 300` and `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01` gives `2E₁ = 398.01`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_correct = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nBoth methods correctly yield `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert it to the required units.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is **5 MeV**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct elements from the provided answers and identifying key points.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem and Initial Values**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference between the relativistic (correct) and classical (approximate) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment from a spontaneous fission event.\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** `m₁ = 2m₂`, where `m₁` is the more massive fragment.\n*   **Sum of Fragment Masses:** `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step was performed correctly and consistently by all agents. We solve the system of equations for the fragment masses in terms of the initial mass `M`.\n\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  This gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which solves to `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  Consequently, `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, we find their rest-mass energies:\n*   **More massive fragment:** `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Less massive fragment:** `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis value was also calculated correctly and consistently by all agents.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn the classical framework, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.\n\n*   Classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, **`T₁,classical = 1 GeV`**.\n\nThis calculation is a crucial baseline and was performed correctly by all agents.\n\n### **5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nThis is the most complex step, but two valid methods were used by the agents, both yielding the same correct result.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the Kinetic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n    *   The relativistic relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    *   Since momenta are conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), we have `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substitute `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using Total Energy Conservation**\n    *   Total energy is conserved: `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   From momentum conservation (`p₁ = p₂`), we get `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   Rearranging: `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = (198)² - (99)² = 29403`.\n    *   `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`.\n    *   Solving the system `E₁ + E₂ = 300` and `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01` gives `2E₁ = 398.01`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n    *   The kinetic energy is `T₁ = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nBoth methods correctly show that **`T₁,relativistic = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### **6. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert it to the required units.\n\n*   **Difference** = `T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nConverting to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   **Difference** = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe numerical result is unambiguously **5 MeV**. The provided options are A) 2 MeV, B) 20 MeV, C) 5 MeV, and D) 10 MeV. The correct choice is C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The distinction between rest-mass energy (`mc²`), kinetic energy (`T`), and total energy (`E = T + mc²`) is critical.\n*   Conservation of momentum holds in both classical and relativistic frames, but the formulas relating momentum to energy are different.\n*   The Q-value represents the total kinetic energy shared between the fragments, `T₁ + T₂`.\n*   A common error source in such problems is unit conversion. Here, the calculation is straightforward in GeV, and the final conversion to MeV is the last step.\n*   The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the physics and math were almost universally correct, there was significant confusion in mapping the numerical answer (5 MeV) to the correct letter option, likely due to inconsistent option listings. The calculation itself is robust.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and performing an independent verification.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Define Variables**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Given Relationships:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation). The difference is `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step is foundational and performed correctly by all agents who show their work.\n1.  We have a system of two equations. We can express them in terms of rest-mass energy (`mc²`):\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n3.  Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n2.  **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n3.  **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is `1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n4.  **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Value**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n2.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship between kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n3.  **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n4.  **Solving for T₁:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then solve the remaining linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert the units.\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a difference of **5 MeV**. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the methods and careful points from the provided answers.\n\n### **1. Problem Deconstruction and Initial Values**\n\nFirst, we establish the known quantities from the problem statement.\n*   **Initial Nucleus:** It is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fission Fragments:** It splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Mass Relationships:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T₁`, and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, `T₁,class`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis step determines the energy available for the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   We solve the system of equations for the masses. Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the second equation:\n    `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M  =>  3m₂ = 0.99M  =>  m₂ = 0.33M`\n    From this, `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n*   Now, we find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the mass defect:\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n    This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n### **3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.\n*   The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics. Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy and momentum is different.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be rearranged to express momentum in terms of kinetic energy `T` (where `E = T + mc²`): `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the terms:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then group the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   Solving for the correct relativistic kinetic energy:\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classical values and convert the units.\n*   **Difference** = `T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Converting to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    **Difference** = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification of the physics problem, here is a consolidated solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental properties of the system after fission.\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:** We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. The sum of their masses is `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Masses:** By substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation, we get `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Calculating Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is calculated as follows:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`, we have `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between a particle's total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite. Therefore, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`. This leads to the relation: `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was `Mc²`. The final total energy is `E₁ + E₂`. Thus, `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We can solve for the total energy of the first fragment, `E₁`.\n    1.  From momentum conservation: `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    2.  Substituting known values: `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = (198)² - (99)² = 29403`.\n    3.  This gives `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n    4.  Solving the system of equations `E₁ + E₂ = 300` and `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01` yields `2E₁ = 398.01`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n    5.  The correct kinetic energy is `T₁,correct = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert this value to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All candidate answers that performed the full calculation arrived at the same numerical result of 5 MeV. The physics and mathematical steps are robust.\n*   **Formula Application:** The distinction between the classical formula `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` is critical and was handled correctly in the detailed analyses.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The problem involves energies in GeV, but the options are in MeV. The conversion `0.005 GeV = 5 MeV` is a necessary final step.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculated difference is 5 MeV. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) 10 MeV\n    B) 5 MeV\n    C) 2 MeV\n    D) 20 MeV\n\nThe correct choice is B.

Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nThis step is also calculated consistently by all agents.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using `T = p² / (2m)`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** From `T₂ = 2T₁` and `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, which results in `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nThis is the most critical calculation.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The correct relationship is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4.

Initial and Final State Parameters:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The nucleus is at rest.\n*   Fragments' rest-masses: `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   Sum of final rest-masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n**2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\nThis step was performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n*   From the given relationships, we can set up a system of equations for the rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Solving this system gives:\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n    *   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This was also calculated correctly by all candidates.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation):**\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, momentum conservation (`p₁ = p₂`) and the kinetic energy formula `T = p² / (2m)` lead to the conclusion that kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to mass.\n*   `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   Since `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we find `T₁,class + 2*T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   This gives `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value):**\nFor the correct value, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. From this, one can derive `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) means we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Solving this equation for `T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and performing an independent verification.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using correct relativistic mechanics and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis is the first and most fundamental step. We are given the initial rest-mass energy and relationships between the fragment masses.\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis calculation provides the baseline value for comparison.\n*   **Principle:** Due to conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert units.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem is the distinction between `T = p²/(2m)` (classical) and `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` (relativistic).\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are applied, but their mathematical forms differ between the two frameworks.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All calculations were performed in GeV, with a final conversion to MeV to match the options. This avoids rounding errors.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly calculate the numerical result to be 5 MeV. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options. The calculation itself is robust and unanimously confirmed.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. Based on the options provided in the question:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** This calculation is straightforward and establishes the necessary parameters for the rest of the problem.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments is 3 GeV. This value is used in both the classical and relativistic calculations.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis calculation provides the baseline value for comparison.\n\n*   **Principle:** Due to conservation of momentum (from an initial state of rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta. In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁`.\n    2.  Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    3.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    4.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The classical approximation yields a simple integer result, 1 GeV.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the use of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Principle:** Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Equating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    2.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    3.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    4.  Expand the equation: `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    5.  The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the linear equation: `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    6.  Solve for `T₁`: `600T₁ = 603`, which gives `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The relativistic kinetic energy is slightly higher than the classical one for the more massive fragment. This is because for a given momentum, a more massive object has less kinetic energy, but the relativistic correction alters this simple inverse relationship.\n\n### **Step 5: Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference and convert units.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows a consistent and robust calculation across all provided methods, leading to a numerical result of 5 MeV. The confusion in the candidate answers arises from incorrectly mapping this numerical result to the lettered options. Based on the question's options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 20 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference of 5 MeV corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, taking into account the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of a fission fragment calculated using relativistic mechanics versus classical mechanics. All candidate answers follow the same fundamental steps to solve this.\n\n**1. Calculation of Fragment Properties**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relations:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   By substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum, we get `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which leads to `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    *   The rest-mass energies are therefore:\n        *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the mass defect, converted to kinetic energy.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis part of the calculation is performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n\n**2. Classical Kinetic Energy (T₁_classical)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy Formula:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV` and `T₂ = 2T₁`, we get `3T₁ = 3 GeV`, which means `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\nThis calculation is also consistent and correct across all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T₁_relativistic)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation:** `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁`\n    *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nThis crucial step is also performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Difference**\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT₁ = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Converting from GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n    *   `ΔT₁ = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n1.  **Calculation Consistency:** All candidate answers that show their work arrive at the same numerical result: **5 MeV**. The physics and the mathematical steps are sound and verified.\n2.  **Unit Conversion:** The final conversion from GeV to MeV is a necessary step that all candidates performed correctly.\n3.  **Mapping to Options:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers is incorrectly mapping the calculated result of 5 MeV to the provided options (A, B, C, D). The prompt clearly lists the options as:\n    *   A) 2 MeV\n    *   B) 20 MeV\n    *   C) 10 MeV\n    *   D) 5 MeV\n\nThe calculated result of 5 MeV directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve the problem by first determining the physical quantities of the system and then calculating the required kinetic energies. I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish Initial Values**: Define the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (`Mc²`) as 300 GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Properties**: Using the given relationships (`m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`), I will calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁c²` and `m₂c²`).\n3.  **Determine Q-value**: I will calculate the total kinetic energy released in the fission (the Q-value) by finding the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical T₁**: I will find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using the non-relativistic (classical) approximation. In this approximation, kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to the mass.\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic T₁**: I will find the correct kinetic energy (`T₁`) using the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum. The relativistic energy-momentum relation `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` is key here.\n6.  **Compute the Difference**: I will calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values of `T₁`.\n7.  **Final Answer**: I will convert the result to MeV and select the corresponding option from the provided list.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result.

Substitute the first into the second: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    *   From this, we find `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n    *   Now, we calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n        *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n    *   The energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n    *   **Careful Point:** In both classical and relativistic mechanics, conservation of momentum dictates that since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, we need to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m₁` (the more massive) and `m₂`.\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Sum of Masses:** We are also given that the sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nFrom this, we can find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2m₂ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNow, we can calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁c²`): `0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂c²`): `0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted entirely into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.\n\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### **3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   `T₁,class = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂,class = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\nSince `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class = 1 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics. The relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, the relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite (`p₁ = p₂ = p`). Therefore, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\nWe can express `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nEquating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁`. We substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n`Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the methods and identifying key points from the provided answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of a fission fragment calculated using relativistic mechanics versus classical mechanics. This requires a careful application of conservation laws in both frameworks.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments and the Q-value**\n\nThis initial step was performed correctly and consistently by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment) and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   By substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation, we get `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which leads to `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step was also performed consistently and correctly by all candidates.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we substitute the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the classical kinetic energy is `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nThis is the most complex step, but the candidate answers correctly apply relativistic principles, arriving at the same result through two valid methods.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The key equation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Since the momenta are equal, we can set `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    Substituting the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out, and simplifying the equation gives:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Difference**\n\nThis final step requires subtracting the classical value from the correct relativistic value and converting the units.\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT₁ = T₁,correct - T₁,class = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Calculation Consistency:** All provided answers that show detailed work correctly calculate the numerical difference to be **5 MeV**. This high level of agreement confirms the result.\n2.  **Formulas:** The distinction between the classical `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` is critical and was handled correctly.\n3.  **Main Source of Error:** The discrepancy among the final answers is not in the calculation itself, but in mapping the numerical result (5 MeV) to the multiple-choice letters (A, B, C, D). Several candidate answers seem to refer to a different set of options than the one provided in the prompt.\n4.  **Final Decision:** Based on the robust and unanimously confirmed calculation, the correct numerical answer is 5 MeV.

Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis is the foundational step and is calculated correctly in all detailed answers.\n*   **Given:** Initial rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The fragments have masses `m₁` and `m₂` such that `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for masses:** Substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the mass defect, `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step is also performed consistently and correctly.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Result:** `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step, but the candidate answers correctly apply relativistic principles.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since `E = T + mc²`, this can be written as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **Result:** `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThis is the final calculation.\n*   **Difference = T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical**\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Conversion to MeV:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   The numerical calculation is robust. Every detailed analysis arrives at the same physical quantities: `m₁c²=198 GeV`, `m₂c²=99 GeV`, `Q=3 GeV`, `T₁,classical=1 GeV`, and `T₁,relativistic=1.005 GeV`.\n*   The final numerical difference is unambiguously **5 MeV**.\n*   The primary source of error in the candidate answers is mapping this numerical result to the provided options.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nThis step is foundational and was performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Mass relationship between fragments: `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n    *   Sum of fragment masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n    2.  Solve for `m₂`: `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    3.  Solve for `m₁`: `m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 0.66M`.\n    4.  Convert these mass relationships into rest-mass energies:\n        *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments. This step was also performed correctly by all candidates.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis calculation provides the baseline value for comparison.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The key principle is the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    2.  The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n    3.  Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n    4.  Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n    5.  Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    6.  Therefore, `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the correct application of relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds. However, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is now `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E = T + mc²` is the total energy.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  From the energy-momentum relation, we can express momentum as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n    2.  Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for the two fragments: `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    3.  An alternative, as used by most candidates, is to express `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy: `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    4.  Equating the momenta gives: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    5.  Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    6.  `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    7.  `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    8.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel.\n    9.  `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    10. `600T₁ = 603`\n    11. `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5.

Analysis of the Problem and Initial Values**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify all the given information and the objective.\n*   **Initial Nucleus:** Rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. It is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Fission Fragments:** Two fragments, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Mass Relationships:**\n    *   `m₁ = 2m₂`\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated with relativistic mechanics (`T₁_correct`) and classical mechanics (`T₁_classical`). The result should be in MeV.\n    *   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n\n### **2.

This was done correctly by all agents.\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  Solve for the masses in terms of `M`: `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies using `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, we use the conservation of momentum and the classical formula for kinetic energy.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_class / T₂_class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_class:** Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics. The agents demonstrated two valid methods, both leading to the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using Kinetic Energy and Momentum Relation**\n*   The relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can set their squared values equal: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms cancel. `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`.\n    *   `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**Method 2: Using Total Energy and Momentum Relation**\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²` implies `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n*   Rearranging: `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n*   `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198)² - (99)² = 29403`.\n*   `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = 29403` => `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`.\n*   Solving the system `E₁ + E₂ = 300` and `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01` gives `2E₁ = 398.01`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_correct = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nBoth methods correctly yield `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert it to the required units.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is **5 MeV**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct elements from the provided answers and identifying key points.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem and Initial Values**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference between the relativistic (correct) and classical (approximate) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment from a spontaneous fission event.\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Ratio:** `m₁ = 2m₂`, where `m₁` is the more massive fragment.\n*   **Sum of Fragment Masses:** `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step was performed correctly and consistently by all agents. We solve the system of equations for the fragment masses in terms of the initial mass `M`.\n\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  This gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which solves to `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  Consequently, `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, we find their rest-mass energies:\n*   **More massive fragment:** `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   **Less massive fragment:** `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis value was also calculated correctly and consistently by all agents.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn the classical framework, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.\n\n*   Classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`: `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, **`T₁,classical = 1 GeV`**.\n\nThis calculation is a crucial baseline and was performed correctly by all agents.\n\n### **5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nThis is the most complex step, but two valid methods were used by the agents, both yielding the same correct result.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the Kinetic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n    *   The relativistic relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    *   Since momenta are conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), we have `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substitute `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using Total Energy Conservation**\n    *   Total energy is conserved: `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   From momentum conservation (`p₁ = p₂`), we get `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   Rearranging: `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = (198)² - (99)² = 29403`.\n    *   `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`.\n    *   Solving the system `E₁ + E₂ = 300` and `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01` gives `2E₁ = 398.01`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n    *   The kinetic energy is `T₁ = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nBoth methods correctly show that **`T₁,relativistic = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### **6. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert it to the required units.\n\n*   **Difference** = `T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nConverting to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   **Difference** = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe numerical result is unambiguously **5 MeV**. The provided options are A) 2 MeV, B) 20 MeV, C) 5 MeV, and D) 10 MeV. The correct choice is C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The distinction between rest-mass energy (`mc²`), kinetic energy (`T`), and total energy (`E = T + mc²`) is critical.\n*   Conservation of momentum holds in both classical and relativistic frames, but the formulas relating momentum to energy are different.\n*   The Q-value represents the total kinetic energy shared between the fragments, `T₁ + T₂`.\n*   A common error source in such problems is unit conversion. Here, the calculation is straightforward in GeV, and the final conversion to MeV is the last step.\n*   The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the physics and math were almost universally correct, there was significant confusion in mapping the numerical answer (5 MeV) to the correct letter option, likely due to inconsistent option listings. The calculation itself is robust.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and performing an independent verification.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Define Variables**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Given Relationships:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation). The difference is `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step is foundational and performed correctly by all agents who show their work.\n1.  We have a system of two equations. We can express them in terms of rest-mass energy (`mc²`):\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n3.  Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n2.  **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n3.  **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`. Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is `1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n4.  **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Value**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n2.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relationship between kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n3.  **Equating Momenta:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can set their `(pc)²` expressions equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n4.  **Solving for T₁:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then solve the remaining linear equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert the units.\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a difference of **5 MeV**. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the methods and careful points from the provided answers.\n\n### **1. Problem Deconstruction and Initial Values**\n\nFirst, we establish the known quantities from the problem statement.\n*   **Initial Nucleus:** It is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fission Fragments:** It splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Mass Relationships:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T₁`, and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, `T₁,class`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis step determines the energy available for the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   We solve the system of equations for the masses. Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the second equation:\n    `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M  =>  3m₂ = 0.99M  =>  m₂ = 0.33M`\n    From this, `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n*   Now, we find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the mass defect:\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n    This total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n### **3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.\n*   The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, this ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics. Conservation of momentum still holds (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy and momentum is different.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be rearranged to express momentum in terms of kinetic energy `T` (where `E = T + mc²`): `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the terms:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then group the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   Solving for the correct relativistic kinetic energy:\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classical values and convert the units.\n*   **Difference** = `T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Converting to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    **Difference** = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification of the physics problem, here is a consolidated solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental properties of the system after fission.\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:** We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. The sum of their masses is `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Solving for Fragment Masses:** By substituting `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation, we get `3m₂ = 0.99M`, which yields `m₂ = 0.33M` and `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Calculating Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is calculated as follows:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** The kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`, we have `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio gives `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between a particle's total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite. Therefore, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`. This leads to the relation: `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was `Mc²`. The final total energy is `E₁ + E₂`. Thus, `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We can solve for the total energy of the first fragment, `E₁`.\n    1.  From momentum conservation: `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    2.  Substituting known values: `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = (198)² - (99)² = 29403`.\n    3.  This gives `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n    4.  Solving the system of equations `E₁ + E₂ = 300` and `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01` yields `2E₁ = 398.01`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n    5.  The correct kinetic energy is `T₁,correct = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert this value to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All candidate answers that performed the full calculation arrived at the same numerical result of 5 MeV. The physics and mathematical steps are robust.\n*   **Formula Application:** The distinction between the classical formula `T = p²/(2m)` and the relativistic relation `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²` is critical and was handled correctly in the detailed analyses.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The problem involves energies in GeV, but the options are in MeV. The conversion `0.005 GeV = 5 MeV` is a necessary final step.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculated difference is 5 MeV. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) 10 MeV\n    B) 5 MeV\n    C) 2 MeV\n    D) 20 MeV\n\nThe correct choice is B.

Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis initial step is performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The parent nucleus has a rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Masses:** Given `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`, we can solve the system of equations.\n    *   `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M` → `3m₂ = 0.99M` → `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    *   This means `m₁ = 0.66M`.\n*   **Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released is the mass defect, which becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nThis step is also calculated consistently by all agents.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** Using `T = p² / (2m)`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** From `T₂ = 2T₁` and `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, which results in `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nThis is the most critical calculation.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The correct relationship is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `p₁ = p₂`, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Final Difference**\n\n*   **Calculate the difference:** `Difference = T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Convert to MeV:** `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   The calculation is robust and every candidate answer that shows its work correctly arrives at the numerical result of **5 MeV**.\n*   The primary source of confusion among the candidate answers is mapping this numerical result to the correct multiple-choice letter. This suggests the agents may have been working with differently ordered lists of options.\n*   Based on the options provided in the question (`A) 2 MeV`, `B) 10 MeV`, `C) 5 MeV`, `D) 20 MeV`), the calculated difference of 5 MeV corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the physics and mathematics, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of a fission fragment calculated using relativistic mechanics versus classical mechanics.\n\n**1. Initial and Final State Parameters:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The nucleus is at rest.\n*   Fragments' rest-masses: `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   Sum of final rest-masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n**2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\nThis step was performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n*   From the given relationships, we can set up a system of equations for the rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n    2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Solving this system gives:\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n    *   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This was also calculated correctly by all candidates.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation):**\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, momentum conservation (`p₁ = p₂`) and the kinetic energy formula `T = p² / (2m)` lead to the conclusion that kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to mass.\n*   `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   Since `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we find `T₁,class + 2*T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   This gives `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value):**\nFor the correct value, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. From this, one can derive `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) means we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Solving this equation for `T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Final Difference Calculation:**\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert units.\n*   Difference = `T₁,relativistic - T₁,classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Converting to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** All candidate answers that showed their work arrived at the correct numerical result of **5 MeV**. The physics and mathematical steps are robust and consistently lead to this value.\n*   **Multiple-Choice Mapping:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers was incorrectly mapping the calculated value of 5 MeV to the given multiple-choice letters. The options provided in the prompt are A) 2 MeV, B) 5 MeV, C) 20 MeV, and D) 10 MeV.\n*   **Final Answer:** The calculated difference is exactly 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
