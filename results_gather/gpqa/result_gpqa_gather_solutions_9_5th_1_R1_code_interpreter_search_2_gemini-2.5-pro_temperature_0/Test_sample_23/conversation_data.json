It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z is a critical piece of information. It confirms that all four compounds involved (the two in X and the two in Y) share the same C₆ cyclic carbon skeleton.\n*   **Conclusion:** The clues that Z is a common solvent and the central product of all reactions strongly point to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It contains Z (cyclohexane), does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it is either saturated or aromatic. As it is a different liquid from cyclohexane, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. This strongly supports the idea that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated, stable aromatic compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying a fundamental chemical principle to the reaction.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 5:** The most direct and robust method to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the specific components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nThe remaining information about mixture X can be used to confirm the plausibility of the entire chemical scheme.\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** We can check if there are plausible molecules for mixture X that fit all the given constraints. The components must be C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria: both are unsaturated C₆ rings, the sum of their hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds. This confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 16\nB) 22\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nctrl95>H\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by systematically deducing the identities of the key substances and then applying the law of conservation of atoms to the central chemical reaction. This approach is the most direct and robust, as it relies on fundamental chemical principles.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** I will first determine the molecular formula of substance Z using its given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%). Combining this with the information that it's a saturated, common solvent allows for its precise identification.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Knowing that Z is a component of mixture Y and that Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction, I can deduce the other component of Y. The properties of Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to only Z) are key clues.\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** The core of the solution lies in the disproportionation reaction: `Mixture X -> Mixture Y`. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (the two liquids of mixture Y).\n4.  **Calculate and Conclude:** I will calculate the total hydrogen atoms in the identified components of mixture Y. This sum will be the answer to the question. The Python code will formalize this calculation and present the final choice.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the careful points:\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of H is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of all mixtures yields *only* Z implies that all compounds involved share the same carbon skeleton. Combined with Z being a common solvent, this strongly points to the most common C₆ cycloalkane.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y contains Z (cyclohexane) and another liquid. It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The second component must also have a C₆ skeleton. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. As it is a different liquid from cyclohexane, it must be aromatic.\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The reaction is a disproportionation. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. It is characteristic for such a reaction to produce the fully hydrogenated (reduced) compound (cyclohexane) and the fully dehydrogenated (oxidized and aromatic) compound (benzene).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms**\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`.\n    *   **Careful Point 5 (The Core of the Solution):** The most direct and reliable path to the solution is applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to identify its specific components.\n    *   **Calculation:** Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verification (Optional)**\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria. The sum of their hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the chemical scheme is plausible.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by applying the law of conservation of atoms.\n    It first identifies the products of the reaction and then sums their hydrogen atoms\n    to find the total hydrogen atoms in the reactants.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y.\n    # Based on the problem description, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12) and the other\n    # component of mixture Y is benzene (C6H6).\n    h_atoms_in_cyclohexane = 12\n    h_atoms_in_benzene = 6\n    print(f\"The products (mixture Y) are cyclohexane (H atoms = {h_atoms_in_cyclohexane}) and benzene (H atoms = {h_atoms_in_benzene}).\")\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms.\n    # The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) must equal\n    # the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (mixture Y).\n    total_h_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_in_cyclohexane + h_atoms_in_benzene\n    print(f\"By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products.\")\n    print(f\"Total H atoms = {h_atoms_in_cyclohexane} + {h_atoms_in_benzene} = {total_h_atoms_in_X}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Match the result with the given options.\n    options = {'A': 16, 'B': 18, 'C': 22, 'D': 12}\n    final_answer_choice = None\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        if value == total_h_atoms_in_X:\n            final_answer_choice = choice\n            break\n    \n    print(\"\\nOptions provided:\")\n    print(\"A) 16\")\n    print(\"B) 18\")\n    print(\"C) 22\")\n    print(\"D) 12\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated total is {total_h_atoms_in_X}, which corresponds to option {final_answer_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\nprint(\"<<<B>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The products (mixture Y) are cyclohexane (H atoms = 12) and benzene (H atoms = 6).\nBy the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products.\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\nOptions provided:\nA) 16\nB) 18\nC) 22\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated total is 18, which corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.

One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z is a critical piece of information. It confirms that all four compounds involved (two in X, two in Y) share the same C₆ cyclic carbon skeleton. The \"common solvent\" clue points specifically to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since the mixture does not decolorize bromine water, its components are either saturated or aromatic. As the second component is a different liquid from cyclohexane, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. In catalysis, this often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. The formation of the most hydrogenated species (cyclohexane) and the most dehydrogenated species (benzene) from an intermediate is a classic example of this.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The overall reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The most direct and reliable method to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the specific structures of the components in mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nThe remaining information about mixture X confirms the plausibility of this result.\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Careful Point 5:** We can check if there are plausible molecules for mixture X that fit all conditions. The components must be C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria:\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds, satisfying the specific constraint (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n*   This confirms that the entire chemical scheme is plausible and the result from the conservation of atoms is correct.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of the hydrocarbon Z, which is the final product of hydrogenation.\n\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass) = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`.\n    *   This simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ. A hydrocarbon with this formula can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since the problem states Z is saturated, it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y yields *only* Z is a critical piece of information. It confirms that all four compounds involved (the two in X and the two in Y) share the same carbon skeleton. Combined with Z being a common solvent, this strongly points to the most common C₆ cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Since the mixture does not decolorize bromine water, its components are either saturated or aromatic. As the second component is a different liquid from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated isomer (which would have a different carbon skeleton or be identical). Therefore, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The reaction that forms Y is a **disproportionation**. In the context of catalytic reactions of cyclic hydrocarbons, this typically involves a hydrogen transfer. It is characteristic for such a reaction to produce the most stable reduced form (the cycloalkane) and the most stable dehydrogenated form (the aromatic compound).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying a fundamental chemical principle to the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 5 (The Key Insight):** The most direct and robust method to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. This law states that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the specific, more complex components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nThe remaining information about mixture X can be used to confirm the plausibility of the entire chemical scheme.\n\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Careful Point 6:** We can check if plausible molecules for mixture X exist that fit all constraints. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated, and the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are non-conjugated, satisfying the specific constraint. This confirms that the result obtained from the conservation law is consistent with a chemically sound scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Combining this with the information that it's a saturated, common solvent allows for its precise identification.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Knowing that Z is a component of mixture Y and that Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction, I can deduce the other component of Y.

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`.\n    *   This simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since the problem states Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The problem states that hydrogenation of all starting mixtures yields *only* Z, implying all compounds involved share the same carbon skeleton. Given that Z is a common solvent, the most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, the only possibility is that it is aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The reaction that forms Y is a **disproportionation**. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated (reduced) compound, the other is the fully dehydrogenated (oxidized) and stable aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.

The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, it must be aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The reaction that forms Y is a **disproportionation**. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. It is characteristic for such a reaction to produce the fully hydrogenated (reduced) compound and the fully dehydrogenated (oxidized and aromatic) compound from intermediates.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.

The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, confirming the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem explicitly states that Z is saturated, which means it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y yields *only* Z is a critical piece of information. It confirms that all four compounds involved (the two in X and the two in Y) share the same carbon skeleton. Combined with Z being a common solvent, this strongly points to the most common C₆ cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, the composition of mixture Y must be determined.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton. Since the mixture does not decolorize bromine water, its components are either saturated or aromatic. As the second component is a different liquid from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated C₆ isomer. Therefore, it must be aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. In the context of catalytic reactions of cyclic hydrocarbons, this typically involves a hydrogen transfer. It is characteristic for such a reaction to produce the most stable reduced form (the cycloalkane) and the most stable dehydrogenated form (the aromatic compound).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying a fundamental chemical principle to the reaction.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The most direct and robust method to solve the problem is to use the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. This law states that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the specific, more complex components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nThe remaining information about mixture X can be used to confirm the plausibility of the entire chemical scheme.\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Careful Point 5:** We can check if plausible molecules for mixture X exist that fit all constraints. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated, and the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are non-conjugated, satisfying the specific constraint. This confirms that the result obtained from the conservation law is consistent with a chemically sound scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z is a critical piece of information. It confirms that all four compounds involved (two in X, two in Y) share the same C₆ cyclic carbon skeleton. The \"common solvent\" clue then points specifically to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton. Since the mixture does not decolorize bromine water, its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** As the second component is a different liquid from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated isomer. The reaction type, disproportionation, strongly suggests a hydrogen transfer to form the most reduced (cyclohexane) and most dehydrogenated/oxidized (benzene) stable products.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, confirming the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.
