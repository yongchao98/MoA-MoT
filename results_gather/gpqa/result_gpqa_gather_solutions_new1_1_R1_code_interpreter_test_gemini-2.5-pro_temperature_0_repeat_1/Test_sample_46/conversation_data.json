The two N-H bands in the IR spectrum (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) indicated a primary amine (-NH₂), eliminating candidate D (a secondary amide).\n    2.  The C=O band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an ester, eliminating candidate C (an amide).\n    3.  The two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum confirmed a para-substituted ring, which was consistent with the remaining candidates A and B.\n    4.  The ¹H NMR signals for an ethoxy group (triplet at 1.20 ppm, quartet at 4.5 ppm) were a perfect match for candidate A. Candidate B has a propionyl group, which would show different chemical shifts. This step eliminated candidate B.\n*   **Conclusion:** After applying all constraints, only candidate A, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, remained. It is fully consistent with all IR and ¹H NMR data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the spectral data provided, the compound is identified as follows:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C9H11NO2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the typical range for a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. Its position suggests it is part of a conjugated ester.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This is the typical upfield part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). Together, the signals at 1.20 and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group is donating, and the ethyl ester group is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. This corresponds to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR would show a propionyl group, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (different IR and NMR signals) and is 1,3-disubstituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide (would show only one N-H band in IR) and has a formyl proton signal in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)**\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n*   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for an ester (C=O) functional group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe proton NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information about the carbon-hydrogen framework.\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (`t`) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a CH₂ group). This is characteristic of a methyl (CH₃) group in an ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons has a quartet (`q`) multiplicity, meaning it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a CH₃ group). This confirms the ethyl fragment. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (`bs`) integrating to 2 protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which causes the signal to be broad.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (`d`), each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by an electron-withdrawing group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded by an electron-donating group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the combined data:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the provided data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n*   **IR:** Contains an -NH₂ group and an ester C=O group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Shows an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate, not an ethoxy group. The CH₂ of the ethyl group would be next to a carbonyl, shifting it to ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex NMR splitting pattern than two doublets. Also, the carbonyl is an amide, which typically appears at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR spectrum, not two. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from an ester group.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to an oxygen atom within an ester functionality (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are likely adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining the evidence:\n*   The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 4.0 ppm confirm a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   The IR signal at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the ¹H NMR signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The ¹H NMR signals at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm indicate a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This compound is also commonly known as benzocaine. The molecular formula for this structure is C9H11NO2, which matches the given information.\n\n### Evaluation of a Possible Alternative\n\nLet's consider another isomer, ethyl 2-aminobenzoate (ethyl anthranilate), to see why it is not the correct answer. While it also has the same molecular formula and functional groups, its ¹H NMR spectrum would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region due to the 1,2-disubstitution, rather than two clean doublets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data provided is fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Published spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms these assignments.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   **Interpretation of DoU:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is typically a double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide would also have bands in this region but other features would differ.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is too high for a simple amide (typically ~1680 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The data strongly suggests the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methyl group next to a methylene group (-CH₂-), which is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methylene group next to a methyl group. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). These protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening. This confirms the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which corresponds to a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester's carbonyl). The doublet at 7.0 ppm is more upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Verify**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group**.\n\nLet's put these pieces together: The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Check against formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. The structure has a C₆H₄ ring, a -NH₂ group, and a -COOCH₂CH₃ group. Total atoms: (C₆+C₁+C₂) + (H₄+H₂+H₅) + N + O₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. The formula matches.\n*   **Check against spectra:** The structure has all the required functional groups and proton environments to explain the IR and NMR data perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the oxygen is attached to the ring, and the carbonyl is part of a propyl chain. The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (CH₃CH₂C=O), with the -CH₂- appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. The IR would show one N-H band, and the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the analytical data derived above.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (C=O stretch would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe provided data allows for a clear identification of the compound. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with an α,β-unsaturated ester, where the carbonyl is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) present as an ethoxy moiety.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadripole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n**4. Structure Determination:**\nAssembling the identified fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPlacing these groups in a para arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data and the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n\n**5. Evaluation of Other Options:**\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H band in the IR. It would also have a signal for a formyl proton (-CHO) in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the methylene group of the ethyl fragment would be adjacent to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   For C9H11NO2: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** functional group, especially when conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a simple saturated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the -CH₂- group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, such as the oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the **primary amine (-NH₂)** protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl). The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the fragments:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The two substituents are a **primary amine (-NH₂)** and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nLet's combine these pieces to form the final structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nThis structure is consistent with all the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (C₆H₄ + NH₂ + COOCH₂CH₃ = C₉H₁₁NO₂) - **Matches**\n*   **IR:** Has a primary amine and an ester group. - **Matches**\n*   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts. - **Matches**\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a primary amide (different C=O stretch) and is meta-substituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\nThe formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, especially an aromatic ester. It is too high for a simple amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule implies it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This suggests a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule implies it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which is a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are often due to exchangeable protons. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, suggesting they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester, -COOR). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield, suggesting they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (like the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule has:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acid (CH₃CH₂CO-). The -CH₂- signal would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not a primary amine attached to the ring. Also, it is meta-substituted, not para. Incorrect.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a para-disubstituted benzene ring with the correct chemical shifts for the aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe previous step correctly calculated the Degree of Unsaturation as 5.0. The checker feedback indicated a formula mismatch between the proposed answer (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, C9H11N1O2) and the given formula (C9H11NO2). This feedback is incorrect, as these two formulas are identical. My analysis shows that ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only structure that fits all the spectral data. I will now provide the complete analysis to justify the final answer.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Synthesize the information from the molecular formula (DoU=5), IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum.\n    2.  Systematically evaluate each of the given options against the combined spectral evidence.\n    3.  Conclude with the only structure that is fully consistent with all data.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 2):**\n    I will now perform a comprehensive analysis of all the data to identify the correct compound.\n\n    1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2. The Degree of Unsaturation is 5. This strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n        *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option A) and a bit low for a phenyl ester (like in option D), making a conjugated ethyl ester the best fit.\n\n    3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** are the definitive signature of an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. The very downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of an ethyl ester. This piece of evidence rules out:\n            *   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This has an ethoxy group, but the -OCH₂- quartet would be around 4.0-4.1 ppm.\n            *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This has a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The quartet for the -CH₂- group adjacent to a carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n        *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted.\n\n    **Conclusion:**\n    Every piece of spectral data points unequivocally to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   It has a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   It has an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   It has a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring.\n    *   Its molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n\n    Therefore, option B is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch from an ester group**. The frequency is generally too high for an amide and fits perfectly for an ester conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   Taken together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadropole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the signature pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n### 4. Structure Assembly and Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2 and is consistent with all IR and ¹H NMR data provided.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shift for the -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide (contradicts IR C=O stretch) and is 1,3-disubstituted (contradicts NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π bonds within a molecule. It is calculated using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n\nFor the molecular formula C9H11NO2:\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a clear indication of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The signal is often broad due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on the ring ortho to the electron-donating amino group are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, we can assemble the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nConnecting these fragments results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and all the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our deduced structure with the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our findings perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a different ester group and thus a different NMR pattern for the alkyl chain.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is an amide, which would show a different C=O stretch in the IR and would lack the two N-H stretches of a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is meta-substituted, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis of the spectral data is complete and has been verified.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2 gives a Degree of Unsaturation of 5, consistent with a substituted benzene ring (4) and a carbonyl group (1).\n2.  **IR Spectrum:** The two bands at 3420/3325 cm⁻¹ confirm a primary amine (-NH2). The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms a conjugated ester carbonyl (C=O).\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The triplet (3H) at 1.20 ppm and quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm confirm an ethyl ester group (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   The two doublets (2H each) at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm confirm a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The broad singlet (2H) at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the primary amine protons (-NH2).\n\nCombining these pieces of evidence:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring...\n*   ...with a primary amine group (-NH2) on one side...\n*   ...and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) on the other.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The code execution confirms that only candidate B satisfies all constraints derived from the data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Proposer's Initial Analysis**\n\nThe provided data is for a compound with the formula C9H11NO2.\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to 5 degrees of unsaturation, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C).\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically an ester.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two distinct doublets suggest one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) are the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is consistent with the two protons of a primary amino group (-NH₂) attached to the aromatic ring. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential chemical exchange.\n\n**Proposed Solution Path**\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound is likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (structure A). This structure contains a primary amine, an ester, an ethyl group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, all of which are directly supported by the IR and NMR data. The electron-donating amino group would cause the adjacent aromatic protons to be shielded (appear upfield at ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group would cause its adjacent protons to be deshielded (appear downfield at ~8.0 ppm). This matches the observed spectrum. The next logical step is to confirm the spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination**\n\nThe initial analysis strongly favors ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A). However, to be certain, let's verify the expected spectral data against published values for all candidates.\n\n1.  **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A published spectrum shows peaks at δ 1.35 (t, 3H), 4.16 (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 (q, 2H), 6.62 (d, 2H), and 7.84 (d, 2H). This is an excellent match to the provided data (1.20, 4.0, 4.5, 7.0, 8.0 ppm). Minor differences in chemical shifts are expected due to solvent effects and spectrometer calibration.\n    *   **IR:** A reference IR spectrum for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine) shows characteristic N-H stretches for a primary amine around 3300-3230 cm⁻¹. This confirms the assignment of the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. The C=O ester stretch is also confirmed to be in the expected region.\n\n2.  **4-aminophenyl propionate (B):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The key difference would be the chemical shift of the methylene protons of the ethyl group. In a propionate ester attached to a phenol, the -COCH₂CH₃ group would show a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm. This is significantly different from the 4.5 ppm observed in the data. The NMR spectrum for propionic acid shows this quartet at 2.17 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n3.  **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (C):**\n    *   **IR:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only *one* N-H stretch, not two. The provided data (3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a formyl proton (-N-CHO) which would appear as a singlet far downfield, typically >8.0 ppm. This signal is absent. Furthermore, the ethoxy quartet (-OCH₂CH₃) in the related compound phenacetin appears at 4.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n4.  **3-ethoxybenzamide (D):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern, not the two clean doublets characteristic of 1,4- (para) substitution seen in the data at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The IR would show two N-H bands from the primary amide, but the NMR aromatic region is a clear mismatch.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision**\n\nThe search results confirm the initial analysis. The IR and ¹H NMR data are highly characteristic of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR bands confirm a primary amine and a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR signals perfectly match the pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted ring bearing an amino group and an ethyl ester group. The spectral data for the other isomers are inconsistent with the provided information.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This immediately rules out candidate D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.

The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). Together, the signals at 1.20 and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group is donating, and the ethyl ester group is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. This corresponds to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR would show a propionyl group, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (different IR and NMR signals) and is 1,3-disubstituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide (would show only one N-H band in IR) and has a formyl proton signal in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)**\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n*   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for an ester (C=O) functional group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe proton NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information about the carbon-hydrogen framework.\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (`t`) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a CH₂ group). This is characteristic of a methyl (CH₃) group in an ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons has a quartet (`q`) multiplicity, meaning it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a CH₃ group). This confirms the ethyl fragment. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (`bs`) integrating to 2 protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which causes the signal to be broad.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (`d`), each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by an electron-withdrawing group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded by an electron-donating group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the combined data:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the provided data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n*   **IR:** Contains an -NH₂ group and an ester C=O group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Shows an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate, not an ethoxy group. The CH₂ of the ethyl group would be next to a carbonyl, shifting it to ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex NMR splitting pattern than two doublets. Also, the carbonyl is an amide, which typically appears at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR spectrum, not two. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from an ester group.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to an oxygen atom within an ester functionality (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are likely adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining the evidence:\n*   The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 4.0 ppm confirm a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   The IR signal at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the ¹H NMR signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The ¹H NMR signals at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm indicate a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This compound is also commonly known as benzocaine. The molecular formula for this structure is C9H11NO2, which matches the given information.\n\n### Evaluation of a Possible Alternative\n\nLet's consider another isomer, ethyl 2-aminobenzoate (ethyl anthranilate), to see why it is not the correct answer. While it also has the same molecular formula and functional groups, its ¹H NMR spectrum would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region due to the 1,2-disubstitution, rather than two clean doublets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data provided is fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Published spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms these assignments.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   **Interpretation of DoU:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is typically a double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide would also have bands in this region but other features would differ.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is too high for a simple amide (typically ~1680 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The data strongly suggests the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methyl group next to a methylene group (-CH₂-), which is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methylene group next to a methyl group. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). These protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening. This confirms the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which corresponds to a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester's carbonyl). The doublet at 7.0 ppm is more upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Verify**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group**.\n\nLet's put these pieces together: The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Check against formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. The structure has a C₆H₄ ring, a -NH₂ group, and a -COOCH₂CH₃ group. Total atoms: (C₆+C₁+C₂) + (H₄+H₂+H₅) + N + O₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. The formula matches.\n*   **Check against spectra:** The structure has all the required functional groups and proton environments to explain the IR and NMR data perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the oxygen is attached to the ring, and the carbonyl is part of a propyl chain. The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (CH₃CH₂C=O), with the -CH₂- appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. The IR would show one N-H band, and the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the analytical data derived above.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (C=O stretch would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe provided data allows for a clear identification of the compound. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with an α,β-unsaturated ester, where the carbonyl is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) present as an ethoxy moiety.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadripole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n**4. Structure Determination:**\nAssembling the identified fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPlacing these groups in a para arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data and the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n\n**5. Evaluation of Other Options:**\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H band in the IR. It would also have a signal for a formyl proton (-CHO) in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the methylene group of the ethyl fragment would be adjacent to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   For C9H11NO2: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** functional group, especially when conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a simple saturated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the -CH₂- group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, such as the oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the **primary amine (-NH₂)** protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl). The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the fragments:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The two substituents are a **primary amine (-NH₂)** and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nLet's combine these pieces to form the final structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nThis structure is consistent with all the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (C₆H₄ + NH₂ + COOCH₂CH₃ = C₉H₁₁NO₂) - **Matches**\n*   **IR:** Has a primary amine and an ester group. - **Matches**\n*   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts. - **Matches**\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a primary amide (different C=O stretch) and is meta-substituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\nThe formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, especially an aromatic ester. It is too high for a simple amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule implies it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This suggests a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule implies it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which is a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are often due to exchangeable protons. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, suggesting they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester, -COOR). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield, suggesting they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (like the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule has:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acid (CH₃CH₂CO-). The -CH₂- signal would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not a primary amine attached to the ring. Also, it is meta-substituted, not para. Incorrect.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a para-disubstituted benzene ring with the correct chemical shifts for the aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe previous step correctly calculated the Degree of Unsaturation as 5.0. The checker feedback indicated a formula mismatch between the proposed answer (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, C9H11N1O2) and the given formula (C9H11NO2). This feedback is incorrect, as these two formulas are identical. My analysis shows that ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only structure that fits all the spectral data. I will now provide the complete analysis to justify the final answer.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Synthesize the information from the molecular formula (DoU=5), IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum.\n    2.  Systematically evaluate each of the given options against the combined spectral evidence.\n    3.  Conclude with the only structure that is fully consistent with all data.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 2):**\n    I will now perform a comprehensive analysis of all the data to identify the correct compound.\n\n    1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2. The Degree of Unsaturation is 5. This strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n        *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option A) and a bit low for a phenyl ester (like in option D), making a conjugated ethyl ester the best fit.\n\n    3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** are the definitive signature of an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. The very downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of an ethyl ester. This piece of evidence rules out:\n            *   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This has an ethoxy group, but the -OCH₂- quartet would be around 4.0-4.1 ppm.\n            *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This has a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The quartet for the -CH₂- group adjacent to a carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n        *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted.\n\n    **Conclusion:**\n    Every piece of spectral data points unequivocally to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   It has a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   It has an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   It has a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring.\n    *   Its molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n\n    Therefore, option B is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch from an ester group**. The frequency is generally too high for an amide and fits perfectly for an ester conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   Taken together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadropole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the signature pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n### 4. Structure Assembly and Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2 and is consistent with all IR and ¹H NMR data provided.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shift for the -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide (contradicts IR C=O stretch) and is 1,3-disubstituted (contradicts NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π bonds within a molecule. It is calculated using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n\nFor the molecular formula C9H11NO2:\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a clear indication of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The signal is often broad due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on the ring ortho to the electron-donating amino group are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, we can assemble the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nConnecting these fragments results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and all the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our deduced structure with the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our findings perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a different ester group and thus a different NMR pattern for the alkyl chain.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is an amide, which would show a different C=O stretch in the IR and would lack the two N-H stretches of a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is meta-substituted, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis of the spectral data is complete and has been verified.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2 gives a Degree of Unsaturation of 5, consistent with a substituted benzene ring (4) and a carbonyl group (1).\n2.  **IR Spectrum:** The two bands at 3420/3325 cm⁻¹ confirm a primary amine (-NH2). The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms a conjugated ester carbonyl (C=O).\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The triplet (3H) at 1.20 ppm and quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm confirm an ethyl ester group (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   The two doublets (2H each) at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm confirm a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The broad singlet (2H) at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the primary amine protons (-NH2).\n\nCombining these pieces of evidence:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring...\n*   ...with a primary amine group (-NH2) on one side...\n*   ...and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) on the other.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The code execution confirms that only candidate B satisfies all constraints derived from the data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Proposer's Initial Analysis**\n\nThe provided data is for a compound with the formula C9H11NO2.\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to 5 degrees of unsaturation, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C).\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically an ester.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two distinct doublets suggest one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) are the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is consistent with the two protons of a primary amino group (-NH₂) attached to the aromatic ring. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential chemical exchange.\n\n**Proposed Solution Path**\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound is likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (structure A). This structure contains a primary amine, an ester, an ethyl group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, all of which are directly supported by the IR and NMR data. The electron-donating amino group would cause the adjacent aromatic protons to be shielded (appear upfield at ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group would cause its adjacent protons to be deshielded (appear downfield at ~8.0 ppm). This matches the observed spectrum. The next logical step is to confirm the spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination**\n\nThe initial analysis strongly favors ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A). However, to be certain, let's verify the expected spectral data against published values for all candidates.\n\n1.  **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A published spectrum shows peaks at δ 1.35 (t, 3H), 4.16 (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 (q, 2H), 6.62 (d, 2H), and 7.84 (d, 2H). This is an excellent match to the provided data (1.20, 4.0, 4.5, 7.0, 8.0 ppm). Minor differences in chemical shifts are expected due to solvent effects and spectrometer calibration.\n    *   **IR:** A reference IR spectrum for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine) shows characteristic N-H stretches for a primary amine around 3300-3230 cm⁻¹. This confirms the assignment of the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. The C=O ester stretch is also confirmed to be in the expected region.\n\n2.  **4-aminophenyl propionate (B):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The key difference would be the chemical shift of the methylene protons of the ethyl group. In a propionate ester attached to a phenol, the -COCH₂CH₃ group would show a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm. This is significantly different from the 4.5 ppm observed in the data. The NMR spectrum for propionic acid shows this quartet at 2.17 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n3.  **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (C):**\n    *   **IR:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only *one* N-H stretch, not two. The provided data (3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a formyl proton (-N-CHO) which would appear as a singlet far downfield, typically >8.0 ppm. This signal is absent. Furthermore, the ethoxy quartet (-OCH₂CH₃) in the related compound phenacetin appears at 4.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n4.  **3-ethoxybenzamide (D):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern, not the two clean doublets characteristic of 1,4- (para) substitution seen in the data at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The IR would show two N-H bands from the primary amide, but the NMR aromatic region is a clear mismatch.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision**\n\nThe search results confirm the initial analysis. The IR and ¹H NMR data are highly characteristic of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR bands confirm a primary amine and a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR signals perfectly match the pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted ring bearing an amino group and an ethyl ester group. The spectral data for the other isomers are inconsistent with the provided information.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
