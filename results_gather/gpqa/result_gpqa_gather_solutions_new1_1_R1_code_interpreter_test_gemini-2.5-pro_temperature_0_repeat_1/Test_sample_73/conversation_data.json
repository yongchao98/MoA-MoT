A key characteristic of this type of decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. We are asked to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, which, due to the memoryless property, is equivalent to calculating the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n\nFirst, we must determine the decay constant (λ) from the information provided. The probability of decay, P(t), within a certain time, t, is given by the formula:\n\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nBy rearranging the equation to solve for the exponential term, we get:\n\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNow that we have the decay constant, we can calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. As established by the memoryless property, this is the same as P(150):\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\nP(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the logarithmic property that `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`, we can simplify the exponent:\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n\nSince the exponential function and the natural logarithm are inverse functions, they cancel each other out:\n\nP(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n\n0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we find the probability:\n\nP(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe probability of an atomic nucleus decaying is governed by the principles of exponential decay. A fundamental aspect of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the nucleus has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not alter its intrinsic decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The probability of decay, P(t), within a certain time, t, is given by the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where 'e' is the base of the natural logarithm and 'λ' is the decay constant.

The probability of a single atom decaying does not depend on its age. This is known as the **memoryless property**.\n    *   This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n    *   The problem is mathematically described by the exponential decay law. The probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by `P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is `P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n    *   Using the formula: `P(decay, 100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the given time and probability. We don't necessarily need to solve for `λ` itself, but we can use this relationship.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n    *   Because of the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. The question is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly observed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n    *   So, we need to calculate `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can use the information from Step 2: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Let's use the rules of exponents to relate the two expressions:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * (150/100)) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(1.5)`.\n    *   Now, substitute the value we found in Step 2:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   Let's calculate `(0.68)^1.5`:\n        `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   This value, `0.5607`, is the probability that the atom will *survive* for 150 minutes.\n    *   The probability that it will *decay* in 150 minutes is:\n        `P(decay, 150) = 1 - P(survival, 150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated probability is `0.4393`, which is 43.93%.\n    *   Looking at the given options:\n        A) 48%\n        B) 44%\n        C) 40%\n        D) 52%\n    *   The value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical concept. Forgetting this would lead to a much more complicated (and incorrect) conditional probability calculation. The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information designed to test this understanding.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (`1 - e^(-λt)`) and the probability of survival (`e^(-λt)`). The initial information is about decay, and the final calculation requires finding the decay probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation is made simpler by manipulating the exponents (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating `λ`, which would involve logarithms and could introduce rounding errors.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Probability of survival for 100 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n2.  Let S(t) be the survival probability for time t. So, S(100) = 0.68.\n3.  We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless nature of decay, this is simply the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - S(150).\n4.  S(t) = e^(-λt). Therefore, S(150) = e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (S(100))^1.5.\n5.  S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n6.  Probability of decay in 150 minutes = 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n7.  0.4393 is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a specific time frame is constant and does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. We only need to calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\n### 2.

Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same formula:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can solve for `e^(-λ)` from the first equation:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n(e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68\ne^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation for the 150-minute decay:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^(-λ))^150\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - ((0.68)^(1/100))^150\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nThe final step is to compute the value of 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.559\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.559\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.441\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get approximately 44.1%.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The decay of a single radioactive atom is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom does not \"age\".\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, the fact that it has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The problem is therefore equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   Let `λ` be the decay constant of the atom.\n    *   The probability of an atom surviving past time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n    *   The probability of an atom decaying by time `t` is given by the cumulative distribution function `F(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `F(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes, which is `F(150)`.\n    *   `F(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to the value we found in the previous step, `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Using the properties of exponents: `e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(150/100) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value: `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is `F(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   The python code calculated this value: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.4393`.\n    *   Converting this to a percentage gives 43.93%.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to the given option C) 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay Process:** Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential decay law.

Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, which is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not change its probability of decaying in any future time period.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the survival probability.** The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) until time *t* is given by the exponential decay formula: P(survival) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant (λ).** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.

Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\n    P(decay within 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n\n4.  **Solve for the unknown probability.** We can find the value of e^(-λ * 150) from the information we found in step 2:\n    From 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100), we can write e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100).\n\n    Now substitute this into the equation for 150 minutes:\n    P(survival for 150 min) = e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ))^150 = (0.68^(1/100))^150 = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5.\n\n    Calculating the value:\n    0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\n    Finally, calculate the probability of decay:\n    P(decay within 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\nThis probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe model correctly identified the exponential decay nature of the problem and the crucial \"memoryless\" property.

The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the decay constant, λ, from the initial information: a 32% probability of decay in 100 minutes. The survival probability, P(T > t), is given by e^(-λt). Therefore, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt).\n    *   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n2.  Next, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability: P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n3.  Due to the memoryless property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval starting from time zero: P(T < 150).\n4.  Calculate P(T < 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n5.  From step 1, we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68. We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^(1.5), which is 0.68^1.5.\n6.  The final probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. I will use a search query to perform this calculation accurately.\n\nMy proposed action is to use a search engine to calculate the final numerical value.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially the application of the memoryless property, which is a fundamental concept in exponential decay processes. However, the entire answer hinges on the correct application of this principle and the subsequent calculation. My main concern is ensuring the calculation is precise, as the multiple-choice options are relatively close to each other. A search that also confirms the formula for conditional probability in radioactive decay would add confidence to the result.\n\nDecide: The proposed path is logical. The next step is to execute the calculation and verify the underlying principle. A combined search can achieve this.\n\nProposer: The search results confirm my initial approach. Result explicitly states the memoryless property of processes like radioactive decay: \"P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)\". This means the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes it has already survived. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the unconditional probability of decay within 150 minutes. My calculation path remains the same: find the decay constant λ from the first condition and then use it to find the probability for a 150-minute interval. The final calculation is `1 - 0.68^1.5`.\n\nSkeptic: I agree. The search results, particularly and, strongly support the use of the memoryless property for single-atom decay. The problem is now reduced to a straightforward calculation. The key is to perform this calculation accurately to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nDecide: The debate has converged. The physical principle is confirmed, and the calculation is clear. The next and final step is to perform the calculation and select the answer.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define Survival Probability:** The probability that an atom survives past time `t` is `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n2.  **Use Given Information:** We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the survival probability is 100% - 32% = 68%.\n    *   `P(T > 100) = e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes. This is `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)`. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this is equal to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, `P(T < 150)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   `P(T < 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   From step 2, we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   Substituting this value gives: `1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating the value: `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   The final probability is `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.

The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information designed to test this understanding.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (`1 - e^(-λt)`) and the probability of survival (`e^(-λt)`). The initial information is about decay, and the final calculation requires finding the decay probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation is made simpler by manipulating the exponents (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating `λ`, which would involve logarithms and could introduce rounding errors.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Probability of survival for 100 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n2.  Let S(t) be the survival probability for time t. So, S(100) = 0.68.\n3.  We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless nature of decay, this is simply the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - S(150).\n4.  S(t) = e^(-λt). Therefore, S(150) = e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (S(100))^1.5.\n5.  S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n6.  Probability of decay in 150 minutes = 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n7.  0.4393 is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a specific time frame is constant and does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. We only need to calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere:\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718).\n*   `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   `t` is the time.\n\nThe probability of decay is therefore:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find the probability of survival.\n\nP(survival in 100 min) = 1 - P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same formula:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can solve for `e^(-λ)` from the first equation:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n(e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68\ne^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation for the 150-minute decay:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^(-λ))^150\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - ((0.68)^(1/100))^150\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nThe final step is to compute the value of 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.559\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.559\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.441\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get approximately 44.1%.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The decay of a single radioactive atom is a random process that follows an exponential distribution.

Because the process is memoryless, the fact that it has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The problem is therefore equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   Let `λ` be the decay constant of the atom.\n    *   The probability of an atom surviving past time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n    *   The probability of an atom decaying by time `t` is given by the cumulative distribution function `F(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `F(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes, which is `F(150)`.\n    *   `F(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to the value we found in the previous step, `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Using the properties of exponents: `e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(150/100) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value: `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is `F(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   The python code calculated this value: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.4393`.\n    *   Converting this to a percentage gives 43.93%.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to the given option C) 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay Process:** Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential decay law.

The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the decay constant, λ, from the initial information: a 32% probability of decay in 100 minutes. The survival probability, P(T > t), is given by e^(-λt). Therefore, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt).\n    *   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n2.  Next, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability: P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n3.  Due to the memoryless property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval starting from time zero: P(T < 150).\n4.

Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this is equal to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, `P(T < 150)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   `P(T < 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   From step 2, we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   Substituting this value gives: `1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating the value: `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   The final probability is `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.
