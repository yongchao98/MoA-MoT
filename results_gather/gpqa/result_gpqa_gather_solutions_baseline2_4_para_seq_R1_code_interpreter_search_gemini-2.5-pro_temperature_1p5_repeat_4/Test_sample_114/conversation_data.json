Identify Governing Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a particle annihilation at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors, γ, greater than 1). As consistently identified by all candidate answers, the solution must adhere to two fundamental laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy**\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum**\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation of Energy\nFirst, we calculate the total energy of the system before the annihilation. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `m` is the rest mass and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Initial Energy of the electron (γe = 4):** `Ee = 4mc²`\n*   **Initial Energy of the positron (γp = 2):** `Ep = 2mc²`\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):** `E_initial = Ee + Ep = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n\nThis energy is then completely converted into two photons of equal energy, `Eγ`.\n*   **Total Final Energy (E_final):** `E_final = Eγ + Eγ = 2Eγ`\n*   By energy conservation, `E_initial = E_final`, so `6mc² = 2Eγ`.\n*   This gives the energy of each photon: **`Eγ = 3mc²`**.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Momentum\nNext, we calculate the total momentum of the system. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive (+) direction. The momentum of a relativistic particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum of the electron:** `pe = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n*   **Initial Momentum of the positron:** `pp = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (P_initial):** The net momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely on the horizontal axis: `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\nThis initial momentum must be conserved after the annihilation.\n*   The momentum of a photon is `pγ = Eγ / c`. Using our result from energy conservation, `pγ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   The initial momentum had no vertical component. To conserve momentum, the final vertical momenta must also sum to zero. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n*   The total final momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta: `P_final = pγcos(θ) + pγcos(θ) = 2pγcos(θ)`.\n*   By momentum conservation, `P_initial = P_final`:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2pγcos(θ)`\n\n### 4. Solve for the Angle\nWe now have an equation that we can solve for the angle `θ`.\n\n1.  Substitute the photon momentum `pγ = 3mc` into the equation:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n2.  The term `mc` cancels from both sides, leaving:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n3.  Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n4.  The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`. Therefore, we must calculate:\n    `Angle = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation and Conclusion\nA numerical calculation of the expression above gives:\n`Angle ≈ 138.19°`\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to the integer 138. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 96\nB) 172\nC) 138\nD) 74\n\nThe result matches option C. The consensus among all provided candidate answers confirms this result and calculation method.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step application of the principles of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum. Here is a consolidated analysis based on the reasoning presented by the agents.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Electron's Energy:** The electron has a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. Its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** The positron has a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. Its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n**2. Apply Energy Conservation to Find Photon Energy**\n\nAfter the annihilation, the total initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n*   **Total Final Energy:** `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\n*   Therefore, `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means the energy of each individual photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**3. Calculate Initial Relativistic Momentum**\n\nMomentum is a vector quantity. The magnitude of a particle's relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n*   Let's define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive direction.\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** It moves in the opposite (negative) direction. `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum:** The net momentum of the system is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the horizontal axis:\n    `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n**4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\n\nThe total initial momentum must be equal to the total final momentum of the two photons.\n*   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Using the photon energy from Step 2, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   Since the initial momentum had no vertical component, the final vertical components must cancel out. This implies the photons are emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis. The angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momenta: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow we can substitute the value of `p_γ` into the equation and solve for `θ`.\n*   Substitute `p_γ = 3mc`:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n*   Cancel the `mc` term from both sides:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n*   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n*   The angle we want is `2θ`. First, find `θ` by taking the inverse cosine, and then double it.\n    `Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\n\nCalculating the value of this expression:\n*   `Angle ≈ 2 * arccos((3.873 - 1.732) / 6)`\n*   `Angle ≈ 2 * arccos(2.141 / 6)`\n*   `Angle ≈ 2 * arccos(0.3568)`\n*   `Angle ≈ 2 * 69.1°`\n*   `Angle ≈ 138.2°`\n\nThe more precise calculation confirmed by the agents' code executions is approximately `138.19°`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated angle is `138.19°`, which rounds to `138°`.

After analyzing the reasoning provided by the various agents, a clear and consistent method emerges.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Define Initial Conditions and Governing Principles:**\n    *   An electron moves from the left with a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   A positron moves from the right with a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   The electron's rest mass `m` is equal to the positron's rest mass.\n    *   The core principles are the **Conservation of Relativistic Energy** and the **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum**.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):**\n    The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of the electron: `E_e = 4mc²`.\n    *   Energy of the positron: `E_p = 2mc²`.\n    *   Total initial energy is the sum of their individual energies:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n3.  **Apply Energy Conservation to the Final State (Photons):**\n    *   The initial energy `E_initial` is completely converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n    *   The total final energy is `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   By the conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`, so `6mc² = 2E_γ`.\n    *   This gives the energy of each individual photon: `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):**\n    *   Momentum is a vector quantity. The relativistic momentum of a massive particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n    *   Let's define the direction of the electron (moving from left to right) as the positive x-direction. Its momentum is:\n        `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n    *   The positron moves in the opposite (negative) direction. Its momentum is:\n        `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n    *   The total initial momentum of the system is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the horizontal x-axis:\n        `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to the Final State (Photons):**\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Using our result from Step 3, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero. To conserve y-momentum, the final y-momentum must also be zero. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle `θ`.\n    *   The total final momentum in the horizontal (x) direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta: `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum along the x-axis:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle between Photons:**\n    *   Substitute the value of the photon momentum (`p_γ = 3mc`) into the equation from Step 5:\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n    *   The `mc` terms on both sides cancel out:\n        `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n    *   Now, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n    *   The question asks for the total angle *between* the two photons, which is `θ + θ = 2θ`.\n    *   Therefore, the final angle is `2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n    *   Numerically calculating this value gives `2θ ≈ 138.19°`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and robustly yields an angle of approximately 138.19°.

Here is a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### 1. Identify Physical Principles\nThe event involves particles at relativistic speeds (`γ > 1`) annihilating into photons. This is governed by:\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum vector of the system before the collision must equal the total momentum vector after the collision.\n\n### 2. Calculate Initial Energy\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy:** Given `γ_e = 4`, its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** Given `γ_p = 2`, its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** The total energy is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n### 3. Apply Energy Conservation to Find Photon Energy\nThe initial energy is completely converted into two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n\n*   The total final energy is `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   According to energy conservation, `E_initial = E_final`:\n    `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n*   This gives the energy of each individual photon as `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n### 4. Calculate Initial Momentum\nThe magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector. We'll define the direction of the electron (moving from the left) as the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (`p_e`):**\n    `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum (`p_p`):** It moves in the opposite (negative) direction.\n    `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):** The net momentum is the vector sum. Since both particles move along the horizontal axis, the total momentum is:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n### 5. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle\nThe momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`.\n*   **Photon Momentum (`p_γ`):** From step 3, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:**\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical direction (perpendicular to motion) was zero. To conserve momentum, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at symmetric angles relative to the horizontal axis (one at `+θ`, one at `-θ`). The problem description (\"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\") confirms this.\n    *   The final momentum in the horizontal direction must equal the initial momentum. The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is `p_γ * cos(θ)`. The total final horizontal momentum is `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   **Equating Initial and Final Momentum:**\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n### 6. Solve for the Angle Between the Photons\nNow we substitute `p_γ = 3mc` into our momentum equation and solve for the angle.\n\n*   `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n*   The term `mc` cancels from both sides, simplifying the equation:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n*   We can now solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n*   The question asks for the total angle **between** the two photons, which is `2θ`. Therefore, the final answer is:\n    **Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)**\n\n### 7. Numerical Calculation\nUsing a calculator for the final value:\n*   `√15 ≈ 3.873`\n*   `√3 ≈ 1.732`\n*   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n*   **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 138.2°**\n\nThis result is closest to the integer value of 138.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step to arrive at the solution.\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum Calculation\n\nWe first calculate the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision. Let `m` be the rest mass of the electron (which is the same as the positron's) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`)**: The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of these two:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`)**: The momentum of a relativistic particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Since momentum is a vector, we'll define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive (+) direction.\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n    *   Momentum of the positron (moving in the opposite direction): `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the horizontal axis:\n        `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`\n\n### 2. Final State: Applying Conservation Laws\n\nAfter the annihilation, the initial energy and momentum are transferred to two photons of equal energy.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons.\n    *   `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n    *   This means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: The total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum of the two photons.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is given by `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Substituting the photon's energy, we find the magnitude of each photon's momentum: `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   Since the initial momentum in the vertical direction was zero, the final vertical momenta must cancel out. This implies that if one photon is emitted at an angle `θ` above the horizontal axis, the other must be emitted at an angle `θ` below it.\n    *   The total angle between the photons is therefore `2θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum: `P_initial = P_final`\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n\n### 3. Solving for the Angle\n\nNow, we can solve for the angle `2θ`.\n\n1.

Identify the Governing Physical Principles\nThe problem involves particles moving at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors γ > 1) that annihilate each other. This process is governed by two fundamental conservation laws from special relativity:\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum vector of the system is conserved.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial State of the System (Before Annihilation)\nLet `m` be the rest mass of an electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):**\n    The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of these scalar quantities:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):**\n    The relativistic momentum of a particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.

To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must be equal and opposite, canceling each other out. This means they fly off at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ` for the upper photon and `-θ` for the lower photon.\n*   The total angle *between* the photons is `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the horizontal (x) direction must equal the initial horizontal momentum. The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is `p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n*   The total final horizontal momentum is: `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the magnitudes of the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n### 5.

Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle\nThe initial momentum must equal the final momentum.\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical direction was zero. To conserve momentum, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   The total angle *between* the two photons is therefore `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n### 5.

A review of the provided candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on this methodology.\n\nHere is a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Conservation of Relativistic Energy**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy of the electron-positron system *before* the collision. The energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy:** Given a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`, its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** The positron has the same rest mass `m`. Given its Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`, its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** The total energy of the system is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\nAfter annihilation, this entire energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n*   `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`, so `6mc² = 2E_γ`.\n*   This means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**2. Conservation of Relativistic Momentum**\n\nNext, we calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision. Momentum is a vector. Let's define the direction of the incoming electron as the positive x-axis. The magnitude of a particle's relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** Moving in the +x direction.\n    `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** Moving in the -x direction.\n    `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):** The net momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the x-axis:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\nThis initial momentum must be equal to the total momentum of the two photons after annihilation.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (`p_γ`):** The magnitude of a photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. From our energy calculation, this is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   To conserve momentum in the direction perpendicular to the initial motion (the y-direction), the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles relative to the x-axis. Let this angle be `θ` for the upper photon and `-θ` for the lower one. The angle between them is `2θ`.\n*   **Total Final Momentum (x-component):** `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final momentum along the x-axis:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n**3. Solving for the Angle**\n\nNow we substitute `p_γ = 3mc` into our momentum conservation equation:\n*   `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n*   We can cancel the `mc` term from both sides:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n*   This gives us an expression for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\nThe question asks for the total angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`. Therefore, we must calculate:\nAngle = `2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\nA numerical calculation of this expression yields approximately **138.19°**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated angle is ~138°.

Identification of Physical Principles**\nThe problem involves particles moving at relativistic speeds (`γ > 1`) and annihilating. The process is governed by two fundamental conservation laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision equals the total energy after.\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum vector of the system is conserved.\n\n**2. Calculation of Initial State**\nLet `m` be the rest mass of the electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):**\n    The energy of a relativistic particle is `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Electron energy (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n    *   Positron energy (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n    *   The total energy is the sum: `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):**\n    The momentum of a relativistic particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector. We define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive axis.\n    *   Electron momentum: `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n    *   Positron momentum (moving in the opposite direction): `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n    *   The total momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely on the horizontal axis:\n        `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n**3. Calculation of Final State and Application of Conservation Laws**\nThe system annihilates into two photons of equal energy.\n\n*   **Energy per Photon (`E_γ`):**\n    From energy conservation, the initial energy `6mc²` is converted into two photons.\n    `2E_γ = 6mc²`, which means each photon has an energy of `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n*   **Momentum per Photon (`p_γ`):**\n    The momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`.\n    `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum for Angle Calculation:**\n    The initial momentum was entirely horizontal. To conserve momentum in the vertical direction, the two photons must fly off at symmetric angles (`+θ` and `-θ`) to the horizontal axis. The angle between them is `2θ`.\n    The final horizontal momentum `P_final` is the sum of the horizontal components of the photon momenta:\n    `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n    Equating initial and final momentum: `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n**4. Solving for the Angle**\nSubstitute `p_γ = 3mc` into the momentum conservation equation:\n`(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\nCancel the `mc` term from both sides:\n`√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\nSolve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\nThe angle between the photons is `2θ`:\nAngle = `2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\n**5.

The annihilation process is governed by two fundamental conservation laws of physics:\n    *   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy after.\n    *   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum, which is a vector quantity, must be the same before and after the collision.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n    Let `m` be the rest mass of an electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n    *   **Total Energy (`E_initial`):** The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`. Since energy is a scalar, we sum the energies of the two particles.\n        *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n        *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n        *   `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n    *   **Total Momentum (`P_initial`):** The relativistic momentum of a particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector. We must define a positive direction, typically the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right).\n        *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n        *   Momentum of the positron (moving in the opposite direction): `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n        *   `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.

To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since they have equal momentum magnitudes (`p_γ`), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`. The total angle *between* the photons is `2θ`.\n    *   **Horizontal Momentum:** The initial horizontal momentum must equal the final horizontal momentum. The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is `p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n        *   Total final horizontal momentum: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n        *   Equating initial and final momentum: `P_initial = P_final` => `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    *   Substitute the value of the photon's momentum (`p_γ = 3mc`) into the equation:\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n    *   Simplify the equation by canceling the common `mc` term from both sides:\n        `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n    *   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    *   The final angle is `2θ`.

Identify Governing Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a particle annihilation at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors, γ, greater than 1). As consistently identified by all candidate answers, the solution must adhere to two fundamental laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy**\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum**\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation of Energy\nFirst, we calculate the total energy of the system before the annihilation. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `m` is the rest mass and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Initial Energy of the electron (γe = 4):** `Ee = 4mc²`\n*   **Initial Energy of the positron (γp = 2):** `Ep = 2mc²`\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):** `E_initial = Ee + Ep = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n\nThis energy is then completely converted into two photons of equal energy, `Eγ`.\n*   **Total Final Energy (E_final):** `E_final = Eγ + Eγ = 2Eγ`\n*   By energy conservation, `E_initial = E_final`, so `6mc² = 2Eγ`.\n*   This gives the energy of each photon: **`Eγ = 3mc²`**.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Momentum\nNext, we calculate the total momentum of the system. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive (+) direction. The momentum of a relativistic particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum of the electron:** `pe = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n*   **Initial Momentum of the positron:** `pp = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (P_initial):** The net momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely on the horizontal axis: `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\nThis initial momentum must be conserved after the annihilation.\n*   The momentum of a photon is `pγ = Eγ / c`. Using our result from energy conservation, `pγ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   The initial momentum had no vertical component. To conserve momentum, the final vertical momenta must also sum to zero. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n*   The total final momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta: `P_final = pγcos(θ) + pγcos(θ) = 2pγcos(θ)`.\n*   By momentum conservation, `P_initial = P_final`:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2pγcos(θ)`\n\n### 4. Solve for the Angle\nWe now have an equation that we can solve for the angle `θ`.\n\n1.  Substitute the photon momentum `pγ = 3mc` into the equation:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n2.  The term `mc` cancels from both sides, leaving:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n3.  Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n4.

Calculate Initial Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Electron's Energy:** The electron has a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. Its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** The positron has a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. Its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n**2. Apply Energy Conservation to Find Photon Energy**\n\nAfter the annihilation, the total initial energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n*   **Total Final Energy:** `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\n*   Therefore, `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means the energy of each individual photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**3. Calculate Initial Relativistic Momentum**\n\nMomentum is a vector quantity. The magnitude of a particle's relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n*   Let's define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive direction.\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** It moves in the opposite (negative) direction. `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum:** The net momentum of the system is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the horizontal axis:\n    `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n**4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\n\nThe total initial momentum must be equal to the total final momentum of the two photons.\n*   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Using the photon energy from Step 2, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   Since the initial momentum had no vertical component, the final vertical components must cancel out. This implies the photons are emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis. The angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momenta: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow we can substitute the value of `p_γ` into the equation and solve for `θ`.\n*   Substitute `p_γ = 3mc`:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n*   Cancel the `mc` term from both sides:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n*   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n*   The angle we want is `2θ`. First, find `θ` by taking the inverse cosine, and then double it.\n    `Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n\n**6.

The relativistic momentum of a massive particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n    *   Let's define the direction of the electron (moving from left to right) as the positive x-direction. Its momentum is:\n        `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n    *   The positron moves in the opposite (negative) direction. Its momentum is:\n        `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n    *   The total initial momentum of the system is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the horizontal x-axis:\n        `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to the Final State (Photons):**\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Using our result from Step 3, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero. To conserve y-momentum, the final y-momentum must also be zero. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle `θ`.\n    *   The total final momentum in the horizontal (x) direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta: `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum along the x-axis:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle between Photons:**\n    *   Substitute the value of the photon momentum (`p_γ = 3mc`) into the equation from Step 5:\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n    *   The `mc` terms on both sides cancel out:\n        `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n    *   Now, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n    *   The question asks for the total angle *between* the two photons, which is `θ + θ = 2θ`.\n    *   Therefore, the final angle is `2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`.\n    *   Numerically calculating this value gives `2θ ≈ 138.19°`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and robustly yields an angle of approximately 138.19°.

Here is a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### 1. Identify Physical Principles\nThe event involves particles at relativistic speeds (`γ > 1`) annihilating into photons. This is governed by:\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n*   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum vector of the system before the collision must equal the total momentum vector after the collision.\n\n### 2. Calculate Initial Energy\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy:** Given `γ_e = 4`, its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** Given `γ_p = 2`, its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** The total energy is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\n### 3. Apply Energy Conservation to Find Photon Energy\nThe initial energy is completely converted into two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n\n*   The total final energy is `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   According to energy conservation, `E_initial = E_final`:\n    `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n*   This gives the energy of each individual photon as `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n### 4. Calculate Initial Momentum\nThe magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector. We'll define the direction of the electron (moving from the left) as the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (`p_e`):**\n    `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum (`p_p`):** It moves in the opposite (negative) direction.\n    `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):** The net momentum is the vector sum. Since both particles move along the horizontal axis, the total momentum is:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\n### 5. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle\nThe momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`.\n*   **Photon Momentum (`p_γ`):** From step 3, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:**\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical direction (perpendicular to motion) was zero. To conserve momentum, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at symmetric angles relative to the horizontal axis (one at `+θ`, one at `-θ`). The problem description (\"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\") confirms this.\n    *   The final momentum in the horizontal direction must equal the initial momentum. The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is `p_γ * cos(θ)`. The total final horizontal momentum is `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   **Equating Initial and Final Momentum:**\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n### 6. Solve for the Angle Between the Photons\nNow we substitute `p_γ = 3mc` into our momentum equation and solve for the angle.\n\n*   `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n*   The term `mc` cancels from both sides, simplifying the equation:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n*   We can now solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n*   The question asks for the total angle **between** the two photons, which is `2θ`. Therefore, the final answer is:\n    **Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)**\n\n### 7. Numerical Calculation\nUsing a calculator for the final value:\n*   `√15 ≈ 3.873`\n*   `√3 ≈ 1.732`\n*   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n*   **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 138.2°**\n\nThis result is closest to the integer value of 138.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step to arrive at the solution.\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum Calculation\n\nWe first calculate the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision. Let `m` be the rest mass of the electron (which is the same as the positron's) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`)**: The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of these two:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`)**: The momentum of a relativistic particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Since momentum is a vector, we'll define the electron's direction (from left to right) as the positive (+) direction.\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n    *   Momentum of the positron (moving in the opposite direction): `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the horizontal axis:\n        `P_initial = (√15 - √3)mc`\n\n### 2. Final State: Applying Conservation Laws\n\nAfter the annihilation, the initial energy and momentum are transferred to two photons of equal energy.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons.\n    *   `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n    *   This means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: The total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum of the two photons.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is given by `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Substituting the photon's energy, we find the magnitude of each photon's momentum: `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   Since the initial momentum in the vertical direction was zero, the final vertical momenta must cancel out. This implies that if one photon is emitted at an angle `θ` above the horizontal axis, the other must be emitted at an angle `θ` below it.\n    *   The total angle between the photons is therefore `2θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum: `P_initial = P_final`\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n\n### 3. Solving for the Angle\n\nNow, we can solve for the angle `2θ`.\n\n1.  Substitute the value of the photon's momentum (`p_γ = 3mc`) into our conservation equation:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n\n2.  The `mc` terms on both sides cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n\n3.  Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\n4.  Finally, we calculate the angle `2θ`:\n    `Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\nA numerical calculation gives:\n`Angle ≈ 2 * arccos((3.873 - 1.732) / 6) ≈ 2 * arccos(0.3568) ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated angle is approximately **138.2 degrees**.

Both photons have this magnitude of momentum.\n\n### 4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must be equal and opposite, canceling each other out. This means they fly off at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ` for the upper photon and `-θ` for the lower photon.\n*   The total angle *between* the photons is `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the horizontal (x) direction must equal the initial horizontal momentum. The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is `p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n*   The total final horizontal momentum is: `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating the magnitudes of the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n### 5.

Applying Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\n\nThe total momentum must be conserved. Since the initial momentum was purely horizontal, the final momentum must also be purely horizontal.\n*   Because the two photons have equal momentum magnitudes, to conserve momentum in the vertical direction (which was initially zero), they must be emitted at symmetric angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n*   The angle between the two photons is therefore `2θ`.\n*   The final total momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Now, we equate the initial and final momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n\n### **4. Solving for the Angle**\n\nSubstitute the value we found for the photon momentum, `p_γ = 3mc`, into the equation:\n*   `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n*   The `mc` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6 cos(θ)`\n*   Now, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n*   The angle we need to find is `2θ`.

Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle\nThe initial momentum must equal the final momentum.\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical direction was zero. To conserve momentum, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   The total angle *between* the two photons is therefore `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n### 5.

A review of the provided candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on this methodology.\n\nHere is a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Conservation of Relativistic Energy**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy of the electron-positron system *before* the collision. The energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy:** Given a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`, its energy is `E_e = 4mc²`.\n*   **Positron's Energy:** The positron has the same rest mass `m`. Given its Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`, its energy is `E_p = 2mc²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** The total energy of the system is the sum of their individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`.\n\nAfter annihilation, this entire energy is converted into two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n*   `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`, so `6mc² = 2E_γ`.\n*   This means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n**2. Conservation of Relativistic Momentum**\n\nNext, we calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision. Momentum is a vector. Let's define the direction of the incoming electron as the positive x-axis. The magnitude of a particle's relativistic momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** Moving in the +x direction.\n    `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** Moving in the -x direction.\n    `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):** The net momentum is the vector sum, which lies entirely along the x-axis:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`.\n\nThis initial momentum must be equal to the total momentum of the two photons after annihilation.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (`p_γ`):** The magnitude of a photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. From our energy calculation, this is `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n*   To conserve momentum in the direction perpendicular to the initial motion (the y-direction), the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles relative to the x-axis. Let this angle be `θ` for the upper photon and `-θ` for the lower one. The angle between them is `2θ`.\n*   **Total Final Momentum (x-component):** `P_final_x = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final momentum along the x-axis:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`.\n\n**3. Solving for the Angle**\n\nNow we substitute `p_γ = 3mc` into our momentum conservation equation:\n*   `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`.\n*   We can cancel the `mc` term from both sides:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n*   This gives us an expression for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\nThe question asks for the total angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`. Therefore, we must calculate:\nAngle = `2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\nA numerical calculation of this expression yields approximately **138.19°**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated angle is ~138°.

The annihilation process is governed by two fundamental conservation laws of physics:\n    *   **Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy after.\n    *   **Conservation of Relativistic Momentum:** The total momentum, which is a vector quantity, must be the same before and after the collision.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n    Let `m` be the rest mass of an electron (and positron) and `c` be the speed of light.\n    *   **Total Energy (`E_initial`):** The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`. Since energy is a scalar, we sum the energies of the two particles.\n        *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4mc²`\n        *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2mc²`\n        *   `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n    *   **Total Momentum (`P_initial`):** The relativistic momentum of a particle is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector. We must define a positive direction, typically the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right).\n        *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = +mc√(4² - 1) = +mc√15`\n        *   Momentum of the positron (moving in the opposite direction): `p_p = -mc√(2² - 1) = -mc√3`\n        *   `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)mc`. This total momentum is entirely along the horizontal (x-axis).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n    The initial particles annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy.\n    *   **Energy per Photon (`E_γ`):** By conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons: `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n        *   `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6mc² = 2E_γ`\n        *   Therefore, the energy of a single photon is `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n    *   **Momentum per Photon (`p_γ`):** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `p = E/c`.\n        *   `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum to Find the Angle**\n    *   **Vertical Momentum:** The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction was zero. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since they have equal momentum magnitudes (`p_γ`), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`. The total angle *between* the photons is `2θ`.\n    *   **Horizontal Momentum:** The initial horizontal momentum must equal the final horizontal momentum. The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is `p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n        *   Total final horizontal momentum: `P_final = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(θ) = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n        *   Equating initial and final momentum: `P_initial = P_final` => `(√15 - √3)mc = 2p_γcos(θ)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    *   Substitute the value of the photon's momentum (`p_γ = 3mc`) into the equation:\n        `(√15 - √3)mc = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n    *   Simplify the equation by canceling the common `mc` term from both sides:\n        `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n    *   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    *   The final angle is `2θ`. We first find `θ` by taking the arccosine and then double the result.\n        `Angle = 2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6)`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation**\n    Performing the calculation yields:\n    *   `Angle ≈ 138.19°`\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated angle is approximately `138.19°`. Comparing this value to the given options:\n    A) 172\n    B) 74\n    C) 138\n    D) 96\n\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
