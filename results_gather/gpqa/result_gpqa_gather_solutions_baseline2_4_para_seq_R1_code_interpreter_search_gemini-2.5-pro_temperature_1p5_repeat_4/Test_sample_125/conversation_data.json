This is a critical detail: the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule. It possesses a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n2.  **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a **new stereocenter** at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unaffected.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products formed are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I**: It produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The reactant is **pentane-2,4-dione**. This molecule is **achiral** due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating pentane-2,4-diol. This creates **two new stereocenters** at C2 and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed. Analysis of the product's symmetry reveals three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. They are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II**: It produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers** (one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers).\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomeric compounds**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   **Principle**: An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, having identical properties in an achiral environment, will elute together (co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks**: Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions (which is a safe assumption given they have different molecular formulas), the total number of peaks is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Prediction**:\n    *   The column is designed to resolve every unique stereoisomer present in the mixture.\n*   **Total Peaks**: Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture, the chiral column will resolve all of them. This will result in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   Number of peaks in **chiral HPLC**: 5\n*   Number of peaks in **normal-phase HPLC**: 4\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the principles of both normal-phase and chiral chromatography.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule present as a single, pure enantiomer. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unaffected.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Because a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products formed are **diastereomers**. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the two different faces of the planar ketone, leading to two distinct products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** This reaction produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, creating two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, all possible stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, will be formed. This results in three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they are produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to its internal symmetry (the (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to it).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** This reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomeric compounds (one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture for HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This group contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair).\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis with HPLC with Chiral Stationary Phase**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of 5 distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n    *   A chiral column with sufficient resolving power will separate each of these five unique molecules.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the experiment will yield:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers and verifying the chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has one existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar, prochiral ketone group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (the C5 stereocenter is unaffected), the two possible products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. These are defined as **diastereomers**.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The reaction produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an **achiral** molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Because the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, we analyze all possible stereoisomers of the product:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. The reaction produces **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and **will be separated**, contributing **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will elute together** (co-elute) as a single peak. This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** The products from the two reactions are structurally distinct (different chemical formulas) and will be fully separated. Therefore, the total number of peaks is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B. Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to form temporary diastereomeric interactions with chiral analytes, enabling the separation of all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** The column is designed to resolve every unique stereoisomer present. Since the mixture contains a total of **5 distinct stereoisomers**, the chiral column will resolve them all, assuming sufficient column efficiency.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the chemical analysis:\n*   Number of peaks in **chiral HPLC**: 5\n*   Number of peaks in **normal-phase HPLC**: 4\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found in the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting molecule is already chiral, creating a new stereocenter results in a pair of diastereomers. The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion**: Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4 to form pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Starting from an achiral molecule, all possible stereoisomers are formed. Analysis of the product's symmetry reveals three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.

The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will elute together as a single peak. This group contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: Since the products of the two reactions are constitutionally different molecules, there will be no accidental overlap. The total number of peaks is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\nA chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase and is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers.\n\n*   The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomeric compounds.\n*   An ideal chiral HPLC column will resolve all five of these compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.

The two enantiomers, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will elute together as a single peak. This also gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomers).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to distinguish between all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of 5 distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n    *   An ideal chiral HPLC column will separate each of these five unique compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

Since the starting molecule is already chiral (the C5 center is unaffected), the attack of the hydride ion on the two faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This results in the formation of two products:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other; therefore, they are **diastereomers**.

This stereocenter is not affected by the reaction.\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar, prochiral ketone group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two possible products are not mirror images. The products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products have two stereocenters, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). They are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, which defines them as **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an **achiral** molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry that runs through the central CH₂ group.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed:\n    *   A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, the reaction produces **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **A) Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase) = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **B) Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, by forming transient diastereomeric interactions.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** The mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers. An ideal chiral column will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe:\n*   **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.**\n*   **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.**\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This is a critical detail: the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule. It possesses a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n2.  **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a **new stereocenter** at C3.

It **can** separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Peak Prediction:**\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n        *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting racemic pair).\n    *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):**\n    *   **Principle:** A chiral column is specifically designed to separate all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers, by forming transient diastereomeric interactions with the stationary phase.\n    *   **Peak Prediction:** The column will interact differently with each of the **5 unique stereoisomers** in the mixture. Assuming the column has sufficient resolving power, each compound will produce its own peak.\n    *   **Total Chiral Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the principles of chromatography, we can determine the correct answer. The reasoning across all candidate answers is unanimously correct, pointing to a single conclusion.\n\n### **Detailed Analysis**\n\n**1. Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is `(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one`. This is a single, pure enantiomer with one pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol. This creates a new stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomers**.\n\n**2. Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is `pentane-2,4-dione`. This is an **achiral** molecule because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, three distinct stereoisomers are formed:\n    *   A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to its internal symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe final product mixture contains all the compounds produced, for a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n**4. Separation by Normal-Phase (Achiral) HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It **can** separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, having identical properties in an achiral environment, will elute together (co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**5. Separation by Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to create a chiral environment that allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The total mixture contains **5 distinct stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column with sufficient resolving power will separate each of these five unique compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe:\n*   **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.**\n*   **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers and a first-principles approach to the chemistry involved.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant**: The starting material is `(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one`. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by a strong reducing agent (LAH). This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting molecule is already chiral (the C5 center is unaffected), the reduction is diastereoselective. The attack of the hydride ion on the two different faces of the planar carbonyl group produces two distinct stereoisomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The two products are **diastereomers** because they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Thus, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant**: The starting material is `pentane-2,4-dione`. This is a symmetrical and **achiral** molecule due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction**: It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, creating pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, resulting in an overall optically inactive mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**, produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n4.  **Conclusion**: Reaction II produces **three distinct stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Separation of the Combined Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The **two diastereomers** from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds) and Reaction II (C5 compounds) are constitutionally different and will separate from each other. Therefore, the total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B. HPLC with Chiral Stationary Phase**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The final mixture contains **5 distinct stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column with sufficient resolving power will separate each of these five unique compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis, the chemist should observe:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\n*   A) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n*   B) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   C) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   D) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has one existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified in the (S) configuration. This stereocenter is not affected by the reaction.\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar, prochiral ketone group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two possible products are not mirror images. The products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products have two stereocenters, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). They are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, which defines them as **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an **achiral** molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry that runs through the central CH₂ group.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed:\n    *   A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, the reaction produces **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **A) Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase) = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **B) Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, by forming transient diastereomeric interactions.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** The mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers. An ideal chiral column will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe:\n*   **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.**\n*   **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.**\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
