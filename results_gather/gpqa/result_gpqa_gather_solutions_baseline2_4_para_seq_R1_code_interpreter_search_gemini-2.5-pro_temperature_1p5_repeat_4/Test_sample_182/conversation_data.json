The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex`**: Indicates one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates one C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: Contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: Contains a C=C double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: Contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\n**IHD of the reactant = 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5.**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Option A is 5. This is a common distractor representing the IHD of the starting material, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and the Reagent**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reagent Function:** This combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all functional groups containing oxygen or multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Specific Actions:**\n    *   It reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds.\n    *   It removes the oxygen atoms from the formyl and carboxylic acid groups.\n    *   It preserves stable sigma-bonded ring structures.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to know the specific function of Red P + HI. Weaker reducing agents would not reduce all functional groups. The exhaustive nature of this reagent is key to solving the problem. For example, simply reducing the C=C bonds and not the C=O bonds would lead to an IHD of 3 (1 for the ring + 2 for the C=O bonds), which is the distractor in option D.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   Reactant's unsaturation: 1 ring + 4 pi bonds.\n*   Reaction effect: The 4 pi bonds are removed (saturated). The ring remains.\n*   Product's unsaturation: The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is fully saturated but still contains one ring.\n\n**IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The IHD of the product is not 0 because the ring itself contributes 1 to the degree of unsaturation. Option C (0) is a distractor for those who might assume the ring is also broken.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1. The initial IHD of 5 is reduced by 4 due to the saturation of the four pi bonds. The unsaturation due to the ring remains.\n\n*   Initial IHD (Reactant): 5\n*   Final IHD (Product): 1\n*   Options: A) 5, B) 1, C) 0, D) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All 15 candidate agents correctly performed this initial analysis.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This suffix indicates a C=C double bond (one π bond) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** group (-CHO): This group contains a C=O double bond (one π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** group (-CH=CH₂): This group contains a C=C double bond (one π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** group (-COOH): This group contains a C=O double bond (one π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these gives the IHD of the starting material: IHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As correctly identified by all 15 candidate answers, this is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:** This reagent combination reduces C=C and C=O double bonds completely. It removes the oxygen atoms from aldehydes and carboxylic acids, converting these groups to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts (i.e., -CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton:** The reaction is harsh enough to eliminate all π bonds but not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the alicyclic ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 π bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 π bonds.\n*   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, a saturated molecule that still contains one ring.\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as follows:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the ring remains).\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all have been reduced).\n\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers correctly determined that the IHD of the product is 1. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is irrelevant as it was caused by the options being presented in a different random order for each. The chemical reasoning and numerical outcome were unanimous.\n*   **Distractor Answer:** The IHD of the reactant is 5 (Option D). This is a common trap for students who calculate the initial IHD but forget to analyze the reaction's effect.\n*   **Reagent Knowledge:** Correctly identifying the function of Red P + HI as an exhaustive reducing agent that preserves the ring structure is the key to solving the problem.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct reasoning, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1. Matching this value to the options provided:\n\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 1\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates the presence of a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond within the ring structure. This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a double bond. This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH₂) **: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) = **5**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Option (B) is 5. This is the IHD of the starting material, not the product, and is a common distractor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**.\n*   **Function of Reagent:** This combination is known as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce almost all functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule:**\n    *   It will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It will completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH). This process removes the oxygen atoms and reduces the C=O double bonds.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring skeleton. The ring remains intact.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** It is essential to know that Red P + HI is a non-selective, strong reducing agent that attacks all π bonds but preserves the sigma bond framework of the ring.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring itself untouched.\n\n*   The initial molecule had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The product still contains the 1 ring.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is fully saturated. Its IHD is calculated as follows:\n*   **Number of rings in product:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds in product:** 0 (all have been reduced).\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the final product is 1. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) 1\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the candidate answers, here is a consolidated solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is a count of the rings and pi (π) bonds. We can break down the structure to calculate this value:\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) **: This substituent contains one C=C double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This group contains one C=O double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these components, the total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and the Effect of the Reagents**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a key piece of information.\n*   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n*   **Effect:** Its purpose is to reduce a molecule almost completely to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds (all π bonds) to single bonds.\n    *   It removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Critically, it **does not** break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to the four π bonds but leaves the single ring structure intact.\n*   The reactant had an IHD of 5, comprising 1 ring and 4 π bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 π bonds.\n*   The single ring remains.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the **product** is calculated based on its final structure:\n*   Number of rings = **1**\n*   Number of π bonds = **0**\n\nThe final IHD is 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distractor Answer:** The IHD of the reactant is 5, which matches option (A). This is a common trap for students who calculate the IHD of the starting material instead of the product.\n*   **Reagent Strength:** It is crucial to know that Red P + HI is a very strong reducing agent. A weaker agent would result in a different product with a different IHD. For example, catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd) might reduce the C=C bonds but not the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Ring Integrity:** The assumption that the cycloalkane ring is preserved is correct for this reaction. The carbon skeleton's sigma bonds are not affected.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe chemical reasoning, confirmed by all the provided candidate answers, consistently shows that the four pi bonds in the reactant are reduced, while the single ring remains. This reduces the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency from 5 to 1. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is **1**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. Let's break down the structure to find these features:\n*   **`cyclohex`**: Indicates one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is a π bond and contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is a π bond and contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This functional group (an aldehyde) contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is a π bond and contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This is a π bond and contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the IHD of the starting material:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Careful Point:** Option (A) is 5. This is the IHD of the *reactant*, not the product, and is a common distractor.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Reagents\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is known in organic chemistry as a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its effect is to:\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C in this case) to single bonds.\n*   Completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding hydrocarbon (alkane) groups (-CH₃). All oxygen atoms and C=O bonds are removed.\n*   Preserve the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring skeleton.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to know that this reaction is an *exhaustive reduction*. It doesn't stop at intermediate stages like alcohols. It reduces the functional groups all the way to hydrocarbons, eliminating all pi bonds associated with them.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The product is a saturated molecule that still possesses the single six-membered ring (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\nWe can now calculate the IHD of the final product:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π bonds:** 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nThe IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe logical chemical analysis shows that the four pi bonds in the starting molecule are removed by the powerful reducing agent (Red P + HI), while the single ring remains. This reduces the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency from 5 to 1. The consensus from all the provided candidate answers supports this exact reasoning and calculation.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated IHD of the product is 1, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, drawing a consensus from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All candidate answers correctly identify the following sources of unsaturation:\n*   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` base structure indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    2.  The `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group contains a C=O double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    3.  The `formyl` (-CHO) group contains a C=O double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    4.  The `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂) group contains a C=C double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n\nThe total IHD of the **reactant** is therefore 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. As all the provided analyses correctly state, this is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. The effects of this reaction are:\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds to single bonds. This means all **four π bonds** are eliminated.\n*   It completely removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, reducing them to their corresponding hydrocarbon parts.\n*   Crucially, the stable carbon ring structure (made of single sigma bonds) is **preserved** and not broken by this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the reactant by removing all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds, but it leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   Initial state: 1 ring, 4 π bonds (IHD = 5)\n*   Final state: The 4 π bonds are removed, but the ring remains.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane with only single bonds between atoms in the functional groups.\n\nThe IHD of the **product** is calculated as:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0\n*   **IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Distractor Answer**: The IHD of the reactant is 5. As correctly noted by the candidate analyses, the number 5 is available as option (C) and is a common trap. The question asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers, despite showing different letter choices due to randomized option lists, unanimously agree on the chemical reasoning and the final calculated value of **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is **1**.

Deconstruct the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is a measure of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. Each ring or π bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring structure. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde group also has a C=O double bond. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent has a C=C double bond. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the IHD of the starting material:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Option B is 5. This is the IHD of the *reactant*, not the product, and is a common distractor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This combination is known as a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:** This reagent combination reduces carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double and triple bonds to single bonds. It is strong enough to completely remove oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), reducing them to methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton:** Critically, this reaction preserves the stable sigma bonds of the carbon ring structure. The ring is not opened.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product and its IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to π bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   The reactant had **1 ring** and **4 π bonds**.\n*   The reaction eliminates all **4 π bonds**.\n*   The product retains the **1 ring**.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, a fully saturated molecule except for the presence of the ring. To calculate its IHD:\n\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π bonds:** 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** If the reaction were to also break the ring (which it does not), the IHD would be 0. This is represented by option D. The correct understanding of the reaction's selectivity is key.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe IHD of the product is 1. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Ring Structure**: The name contains `cyclohex`, indicating one six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) Bonds**: We identify all double bonds in the molecule:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO), an aldehyde, contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the reactant is: 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: This is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its primary function is to reduce a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups**:\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their simplest alkyl forms (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃), removing all oxygen atoms and C=O bonds.\n    *   The reaction saturates the molecule by adding hydrogen atoms across all multiple bonds.\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton**: Critically, this reaction is strong enough to reduce the pi bonds but is not typically harsh enough to break the stable sigma bonds that form a carbon ring. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product and Calculate its Final IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all the pi bonds but leaves the ring intact.\n\n*   **Pi bonds in the product**: The four pi bonds present in the reactant (two C=C and two C=O) are all reduced to single bonds. Therefore, the number of pi bonds in the product is **0**.\n*   **Rings in the product**: The single six-membered ring from the reactant remains. Therefore, the number of rings in the product is **1**.\n\nThe IHD of the final product is the sum of these features:\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinguisht Reactant from Product**: A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the starting material (which is 5) and choose that as the answer. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n2.  **Remember the Ring**: After the exhaustive reduction, all pi bonds are gone, but the ring itself remains a source of unsaturation. Therefore, the IHD is 1, not 0. For the IHD to be 0, the product would need to be an acyclic (non-ring), saturated alkane.\n3.  **Know the Reagent**: The key to solving this problem is knowing that Red P + HI is a powerful reducing agent that removes all pi bonds but preserves the carbon ring skeleton.\n4.  **Consensus Analysis**: All 15 candidate answers, despite showing different letter choices due to randomized option lists, reached a unanimous conclusion in their chemical reasoning: the final product has an IHD of **1**.\n\nMatching the calculated value of 1 to the specific options provided:\n\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This is a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.

Conclusion**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All candidate answers correctly identify the sources of unsaturation:\n\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohex-` structure contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four π bonds**:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` indicates a C=C double bond within the ring, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these contributions, the IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1**: This initial IHD of 5 is listed as option (B). This is a common distractor in such questions, representing the IHD of the reactant, not the product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As all candidate answers unanimously agree, this reagent combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its effects are:\n\n*   **Complete Reduction**: It reduces almost all reducible functional groups to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Effect on Multiple Bonds**: It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds in the reactant will be removed.\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton**: It is crucial to note that this reaction, while powerful, does not break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring structure. The ring is preserved.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The reaction is not a gentle reduction; it is an exhaustive one. Both C=C and C=O bonds are fully reduced, and oxygen atoms from the functional groups are removed.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product and its Final IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation caused by pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   Reactant's sources of IHD: 1 ring + 4 pi bonds.\n*   Reaction's effect: The 4 pi bonds are eliminated. The 1 ring remains.\n*   Product's structure: A saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is calculated by counting the rings and pi bonds in this new structure:\n*   **Number of rings**: 1 (the six-membered ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nThe IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all provided candidate answers is consistent and leads to the unanimous conclusion that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**. The IHD decreases from 5 in the reactant to 1 in the product because the four pi bonds are eliminated by the strong reducing agent, while the single ring remains intact.\n\nMatching this calculated value to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated IHD of 1 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the key points.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Reactant**\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The first task is to calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Ring:** The `cyclohex-` name indicates there is one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi Bonds:**\n    1.  The `-3-ene` name indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these up, the IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is known as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Effect on Multiple Bonds:** It reduces all pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This process is called saturation.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:** It completely removes the oxygen atoms from aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), reducing them to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Effect on the Ring:** The reaction is strong enough to reduce the multiple bonds, but it does not break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction eliminates all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but preserves the ring structure.\n*   The initial molecule had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The single ring remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Its IHD is calculated as:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0\n*   **IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n---\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the *product*, not the reactant. The IHD of the reactant is 5 (Option D), which is a common distractor.\n2.  **Ring Preservation:** A crucial piece of knowledge is that the ring structure is not broken during this reduction. If the ring were broken, the IHD would become 0. Option C is 0, which would be incorrect.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction:** One must recognize that Red P + HI is a powerful reducing agent that saturates *all* the pi bonds, including the relatively stable C=O in the carboxylic acid. A weaker agent might have yielded a different product and a different IHD.\n4.  **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers unanimously arrived at the correct chemical reasoning: the four pi bonds are eliminated, but the single ring remains, yielding a final IHD of 1.\n\nBased on the calculation, the IHD of the product is 1. Matching this value to the provided options:\n\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n    The starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` base name indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    *   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:\n        1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates one C=C double bond within the ring. (+1)\n        2.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains one C=O double bond. (+1)\n        3.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains one C=C double bond. (+1)\n        4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond. (+1)\n\n    The total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce nearly all functional groups containing multiple bonds or oxygen atoms to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n    *   All C=C and C=O double bonds are reduced to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds are eliminated.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction does not break the stable sigma bonds that form the carbon ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and its IHD**\n    The reaction transforms the reactant by removing all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaving the ring itself intact.\n    *   **Number of rings in the product:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n    *   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** 0 (all four pi bonds from the reactant have been reduced).\n\n    The IHD of the final product is the sum of these features:\n    IHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the **product**. The calculated IHD of the reactant is 5, which is option (C). This is a common distractor.\n*   **Reagent Functionality:** It is essential to know the specific action of Red P + HI. It is a very strong reducing agent that completely reduces double bonds and oxygenated functional groups to their alkane counterparts, unlike milder reagents which might be more selective.\n*   **Ring Preservation:** The most stable part of the carbon skeleton, the ring, remains intact during this reduction. This preservation of the ring is the sole reason the final IHD is not zero.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe initial molecule has an IHD of 5 (1 ring + 4 pi bonds). The exhaustive reduction with Red P + HI eliminates all 4 pi bonds but preserves the 1 ring. Therefore, the final product has an IHD of 1. Matching this result with the given options:\n\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 5\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the name of the starting molecule, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, and calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates the presence of a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (a π bond) within the ring.

This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group** (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The IHD of the reactant is 5. Option **B) 5** is present in the list and acts as a distractor for those who calculate the IHD of the starting material instead of the final product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n\n*   **Function:** This combination is known in organic chemistry as a very powerful and *exhaustive* reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:**\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their respective alkyl groups (-CH₃). The oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   **Effect on Carbon Skeleton:** Critically, this reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** It is essential to recognize the exhaustive nature of Red P + HI. Weaker reducing agents would yield a different product with a different IHD.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and its IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   The four pi bonds (from the two C=C bonds and two C=O bonds) are all reduced to single bonds.\n*   The single six-membered ring remains.\n\nThe resulting product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. We can now calculate its IHD:\n\n*   **Number of rings in product:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds in product:** 0 (all pi bonds were removed by the reduction).\n\nThe IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The IHD is 1, not 0. The ring itself contributes one unit to the index of hydrogen deficiency. Option **A) 0** is incorrect as it implies the ring was also broken.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the reactant has an IHD of 5. After the exhaustive reduction with Red P and HI, all four pi bonds are eliminated, but the ring remains. The final product has an IHD of 1.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All candidate answers correctly performed this initial analysis.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This signifies a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a C=C double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This group also contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the starting reactant is: 1 (ring) + 1 (ene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (acid) = **5**.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: The value \"5\" is present as option A. This is a common distractor representing the IHD of the starting material, not the product. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Molecule\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As correctly and unanimously identified by all candidate answers, this is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n\n*   **Function**: It reduces a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n*   **Effect on Bonds**: It reduces all multiple bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds in the reactant will be eliminated.\n*   **Effect on Skeleton**: Crucially, this reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n**Careful Point 2**: The key is knowing the specific action of this strong reducing agent: it removes pi bonds and oxygen atoms but leaves the sigma bond framework, including rings, intact.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   **Reactant**: 1 ring, 4 pi bonds (IHD = 5)\n*   **Reaction**: Removes the 4 pi bonds.\n*   **Product**: 1 ring, 0 pi bonds.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Its IHD is calculated as:\n*   **Number of rings**: 1 (the six-membered ring remains).\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Careful Point 3**: The IHD is not 0. An IHD of 0 implies an acyclic, saturated molecule. Since the ring is preserved, the product must have an IHD of 1.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**. This result is supported by the unanimous chemical reasoning of all 15 candidate answers. The inconsistencies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidates were due to them being presented with different, randomly ordered options. Based on the chemical facts, the correct numerical answer is 1.\n\nMatching this value to the options provided in the question:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first crucial step, which all candidate answers performed correctly, is to deconstruct the reactant molecule and calculate its IHD. The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Reactant**: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n*   **Sources of Unsaturation**:\n    *   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` backbone is a six-membered ring, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n    *   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:\n        1.  The `-3-ene` indicates a C=C double bond within the ring, contributing **+1**.\n        2.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond, contributing **+1**.\n        3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1**.\n        4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1**.\n*   **Initial IHD Calculation**: Summing these contributions gives an IHD for the reactant: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Structure**\n\nThe next step is to understand the chemical transformation. The reaction is with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reagent Identity**: As all candidate answers unanimously identified, Red P + excess HI is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n*   **Effect on Molecule**:\n    *   It reduces all pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means the four pi bonds identified in Step 1 are eliminated.\n    *   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids to their corresponding hydrocarbon groups (i.e., -CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n    *   Crucially, this reaction preserves the stable carbon ring skeleton. The ring itself is not opened.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product and Calculate its IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   **Product Structure**: The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is fully saturated, containing only single bonds, but still has the ring.\n*   **Final IHD Calculation**:\n    *   Number of rings = **1** (preserved from the reactant).\n    *   Number of pi bonds = **0** (all four were reduced).\n    *   The IHD of the product is therefore 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Reactant vs. Product**: The question asks for the IHD of the *product*. The IHD of the reactant is 5 (Option B), which is a common distractor.\n*   **Strength of Reagent**: The choice of Red P + HI is specific. A weaker reducing agent would not have reduced all functional groups and would have led to a different product with a different IHD. The comprehensive reduction to an alkane is key.\n*   **Ring Preservation**: The stability of the sigma bonds in the ring ensures it survives the reaction, carrying its +1 contribution to the IHD into the product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a unanimous and consistent chemical analysis across all candidate answers, the reaction reduces the four pi bonds of the starting material but preserves its single ring. The index of hydrogen deficiency for the final product is therefore **1**.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex`**: Indicates one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates one C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: Contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: Contains a C=C double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: Contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\n**IHD of the reactant = 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = 5.**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Option A is 5. This is a common distractor representing the IHD of the starting material, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and the Reagent**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reagent Function:** This combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all functional groups containing oxygen or multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Specific Actions:**\n    *   It reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds.\n    *   It removes the oxygen atoms from the formyl and carboxylic acid groups.\n    *   It preserves stable sigma-bonded ring structures.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is essential to know the specific function of Red P + HI. Weaker reducing agents would not reduce all functional groups. The exhaustive nature of this reagent is key to solving the problem. For example, simply reducing the C=C bonds and not the C=O bonds would lead to an IHD of 3 (1 for the ring + 2 for the C=O bonds), which is the distractor in option D.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   Reactant's unsaturation: 1 ring + 4 pi bonds.\n*   Reaction effect: The 4 pi bonds are removed (saturated). The ring remains.\n*   Product's unsaturation: The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is fully saturated but still contains one ring.\n\n**IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The IHD of the product is not 0 because the ring itself contributes 1 to the degree of unsaturation. Option C (0) is a distractor for those who might assume the ring is also broken.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1. The initial IHD of 5 is reduced by 4 due to the saturation of the four pi bonds. The unsaturation due to the ring remains.\n\n*   Initial IHD (Reactant): 5\n*   Final IHD (Product): 1\n*   Options: A) 5, B) 1, C) 0, D) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All 15 candidate agents correctly performed this initial analysis.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This suffix indicates a C=C double bond (one π bond) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** group (-CHO): This group contains a C=O double bond (one π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** group (-CH=CH₂): This group contains a C=C double bond (one π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** group (-COOH): This group contains a C=O double bond (one π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these gives the IHD of the starting material: IHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As correctly identified by all 15 candidate answers, this is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:** This reagent combination reduces C=C and C=O double bonds completely. It removes the oxygen atoms from aldehydes and carboxylic acids, converting these groups to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts (i.e., -CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton:** The reaction is harsh enough to eliminate all π bonds but not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the alicyclic ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 π bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 π bonds.\n*   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, a saturated molecule that still contains one ring.\n\nThe IHD of the product is calculated as follows:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the ring remains).\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all have been reduced).\n\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers correctly determined that the IHD of the product is 1. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is irrelevant as it was caused by the options being presented in a different random order for each. The chemical reasoning and numerical outcome were unanimous.\n*   **Distractor Answer:** The IHD of the reactant is 5 (Option D). This is a common trap for students who calculate the initial IHD but forget to analyze the reaction's effect.\n*   **Reagent Knowledge:** Correctly identifying the function of Red P + HI as an exhaustive reducing agent that preserves the ring structure is the key to solving the problem.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct reasoning, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1. Matching this value to the options provided:\n\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 1\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates the presence of a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond within the ring structure. This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a double bond. This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH₂) **: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This π bond contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) + 1 (π bond) = **5**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Option (B) is 5. This is the IHD of the starting material, not the product, and is a common distractor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**.\n*   **Function of Reagent:** This combination is known as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce almost all functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule:**\n    *   It will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It will completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH). This process removes the oxygen atoms and reduces the C=O double bonds.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring skeleton. The ring remains intact.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** It is essential to know that Red P + HI is a non-selective, strong reducing agent that attacks all π bonds but preserves the sigma bond framework of the ring.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring itself untouched.\n\n*   The initial molecule had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The product still contains the 1 ring.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is fully saturated. Its IHD is calculated as follows:\n*   **Number of rings in product:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds in product:** 0 (all have been reduced).\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the final product is 1. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) 1\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the candidate answers, here is a consolidated solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is a count of the rings and pi (π) bonds. We can break down the structure to calculate this value:\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) **: This substituent contains one C=C double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This group contains one C=O double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these components, the total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and the Effect of the Reagents**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a key piece of information.\n*   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n*   **Effect:** Its purpose is to reduce a molecule almost completely to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds (all π bonds) to single bonds.\n    *   It removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Critically, it **does not** break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to the four π bonds but leaves the single ring structure intact.\n*   The reactant had an IHD of 5, comprising 1 ring and 4 π bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 π bonds.\n*   The single ring remains.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the **product** is calculated based on its final structure:\n*   Number of rings = **1**\n*   Number of π bonds = **0**\n\nThe final IHD is 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distractor Answer:** The IHD of the reactant is 5, which matches option (A). This is a common trap for students who calculate the IHD of the starting material instead of the product.\n*   **Reagent Strength:** It is crucial to know that Red P + HI is a very strong reducing agent. A weaker agent would result in a different product with a different IHD. For example, catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd) might reduce the C=C bonds but not the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Ring Integrity:** The assumption that the cycloalkane ring is preserved is correct for this reaction. The carbon skeleton's sigma bonds are not affected.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe chemical reasoning, confirmed by all the provided candidate answers, consistently shows that the four pi bonds in the reactant are reduced, while the single ring remains. This reduces the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency from 5 to 1. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is **1**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. Let's break down the structure to find these features:\n*   **`cyclohex`**: Indicates one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is a π bond and contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is a π bond and contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This functional group (an aldehyde) contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is a π bond and contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This is a π bond and contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the IHD of the starting material:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Careful Point:** Option (A) is 5. This is the IHD of the *reactant*, not the product, and is a common distractor.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Reagents\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is known in organic chemistry as a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its effect is to:\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C in this case) to single bonds.\n*   Completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding hydrocarbon (alkane) groups (-CH₃). All oxygen atoms and C=O bonds are removed.\n*   Preserve the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring skeleton.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to know that this reaction is an *exhaustive reduction*. It doesn't stop at intermediate stages like alcohols. It reduces the functional groups all the way to hydrocarbons, eliminating all pi bonds associated with them.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The product is a saturated molecule that still possesses the single six-membered ring (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\nWe can now calculate the IHD of the final product:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π bonds:** 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nThe IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe logical chemical analysis shows that the four pi bonds in the starting molecule are removed by the powerful reducing agent (Red P + HI), while the single ring remains. This reduces the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency from 5 to 1. The consensus from all the provided candidate answers supports this exact reasoning and calculation.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated IHD of the product is 1, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, drawing a consensus from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All candidate answers correctly identify the following sources of unsaturation:\n*   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` base structure indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    2.  The `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group contains a C=O double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    3.  The `formyl` (-CHO) group contains a C=O double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    4.  The `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂) group contains a C=C double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n\nThe total IHD of the **reactant** is therefore 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. As all the provided analyses correctly state, this is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. The effects of this reaction are:\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds to single bonds. This means all **four π bonds** are eliminated.\n*   It completely removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, reducing them to their corresponding hydrocarbon parts.\n*   Crucially, the stable carbon ring structure (made of single sigma bonds) is **preserved** and not broken by this reaction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the reactant by removing all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds, but it leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   Initial state: 1 ring, 4 π bonds (IHD = 5)\n*   Final state: The 4 π bonds are removed, but the ring remains.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane with only single bonds between atoms in the functional groups.\n\nThe IHD of the **product** is calculated as:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0\n*   **IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Distractor Answer**: The IHD of the reactant is 5. As correctly noted by the candidate analyses, the number 5 is available as option (C) and is a common trap. The question asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers, despite showing different letter choices due to randomized option lists, unanimously agree on the chemical reasoning and the final calculated value of **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is **1**. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is a measure of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. Each ring or π bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring structure. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde group also has a C=O double bond. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent has a C=C double bond. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the IHD of the starting material:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Option B is 5. This is the IHD of the *reactant*, not the product, and is a common distractor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This combination is known as a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:** This reagent combination reduces carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double and triple bonds to single bonds. It is strong enough to completely remove oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), reducing them to methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton:** Critically, this reaction preserves the stable sigma bonds of the carbon ring structure. The ring is not opened.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product and its IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to π bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   The reactant had **1 ring** and **4 π bonds**.\n*   The reaction eliminates all **4 π bonds**.\n*   The product retains the **1 ring**.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, a fully saturated molecule except for the presence of the ring. To calculate its IHD:\n\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π bonds:** 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** If the reaction were to also break the ring (which it does not), the IHD would be 0. This is represented by option D. The correct understanding of the reaction's selectivity is key.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe IHD of the product is 1. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Ring Structure**: The name contains `cyclohex`, indicating one six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) Bonds**: We identify all double bonds in the molecule:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO), an aldehyde, contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the reactant is: 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: This is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its primary function is to reduce a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups**:\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their simplest alkyl forms (in this case, methyl groups, -CH₃), removing all oxygen atoms and C=O bonds.\n    *   The reaction saturates the molecule by adding hydrogen atoms across all multiple bonds.\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton**: Critically, this reaction is strong enough to reduce the pi bonds but is not typically harsh enough to break the stable sigma bonds that form a carbon ring. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product and Calculate its Final IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all the pi bonds but leaves the ring intact.\n\n*   **Pi bonds in the product**: The four pi bonds present in the reactant (two C=C and two C=O) are all reduced to single bonds. Therefore, the number of pi bonds in the product is **0**.\n*   **Rings in the product**: The single six-membered ring from the reactant remains. Therefore, the number of rings in the product is **1**.\n\nThe IHD of the final product is the sum of these features:\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinguisht Reactant from Product**: A common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the starting material (which is 5) and choose that as the answer. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n2.  **Remember the Ring**: After the exhaustive reduction, all pi bonds are gone, but the ring itself remains a source of unsaturation. Therefore, the IHD is 1, not 0. For the IHD to be 0, the product would need to be an acyclic (non-ring), saturated alkane.\n3.  **Know the Reagent**: The key to solving this problem is knowing that Red P + HI is a powerful reducing agent that removes all pi bonds but preserves the carbon ring skeleton.\n4.  **Consensus Analysis**: All 15 candidate answers, despite showing different letter choices due to randomized option lists, reached a unanimous conclusion in their chemical reasoning: the final product has an IHD of **1**.\n\nMatching the calculated value of 1 to the specific options provided:\n\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This is a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.

This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the starting material is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n\n**Careful Point:** Option C is 5.

Conclusion**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All candidate answers correctly identify the sources of unsaturation:\n\n*   **One ring**: The `cyclohex-` structure contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four π bonds**:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` indicates a C=C double bond within the ring, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these contributions, the IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1**: This initial IHD of 5 is listed as option (B). This is a common distractor in such questions, representing the IHD of the reactant, not the product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As all candidate answers unanimously agree, this reagent combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its effects are:\n\n*   **Complete Reduction**: It reduces almost all reducible functional groups to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Effect on Multiple Bonds**: It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds in the reactant will be removed.\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton**: It is crucial to note that this reaction, while powerful, does not break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring structure. The ring is preserved.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The reaction is not a gentle reduction; it is an exhaustive one. Both C=C and C=O bonds are fully reduced, and oxygen atoms from the functional groups are removed.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product and its Final IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation caused by pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   Reactant's sources of IHD: 1 ring + 4 pi bonds.\n*   Reaction's effect: The 4 pi bonds are eliminated. The 1 ring remains.\n*   Product's structure: A saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is calculated by counting the rings and pi bonds in this new structure:\n*   **Number of rings**: 1 (the six-membered ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nThe IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all provided candidate answers is consistent and leads to the unanimous conclusion that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**. The IHD decreases from 5 in the reactant to 1 in the product because the four pi bonds are eliminated by the strong reducing agent, while the single ring remains intact.\n\nMatching this calculated value to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated IHD of 1 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the key points.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Reactant**\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The first task is to calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Ring:** The `cyclohex-` name indicates there is one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi Bonds:**\n    1.  The `-3-ene` name indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these up, the IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is known as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Effect on Multiple Bonds:** It reduces all pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This process is called saturation.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:** It completely removes the oxygen atoms from aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH), reducing them to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Effect on the Ring:** The reaction is strong enough to reduce the multiple bonds, but it does not break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction eliminates all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but preserves the ring structure.\n*   The initial molecule had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The single ring remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Its IHD is calculated as:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0\n*   **IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n---\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the *product*, not the reactant. The IHD of the reactant is 5 (Option D), which is a common distractor.\n2.  **Ring Preservation:** A crucial piece of knowledge is that the ring structure is not broken during this reduction. If the ring were broken, the IHD would become 0. Option C is 0, which would be incorrect.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction:** One must recognize that Red P + HI is a powerful reducing agent that saturates *all* the pi bonds, including the relatively stable C=O in the carboxylic acid. A weaker agent might have yielded a different product and a different IHD.\n4.  **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers unanimously arrived at the correct chemical reasoning: the four pi bonds are eliminated, but the single ring remains, yielding a final IHD of 1.\n\nBased on the calculation, the IHD of the product is 1. Matching this value to the provided options:\n\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n    The starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` base name indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    *   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:\n        1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates one C=C double bond within the ring. (+1)\n        2.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains one C=O double bond. (+1)\n        3.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains one C=C double bond. (+1)\n        4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond. (+1)\n\n    The total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce nearly all functional groups containing multiple bonds or oxygen atoms to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n    *   All C=C and C=O double bonds are reduced to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds are eliminated.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction does not break the stable sigma bonds that form the carbon ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and its IHD**\n    The reaction transforms the reactant by removing all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaving the ring itself intact.\n    *   **Number of rings in the product:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n    *   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** 0 (all four pi bonds from the reactant have been reduced).\n\n    The IHD of the final product is the sum of these features:\n    IHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the **product**. The calculated IHD of the reactant is 5, which is option (C). This is a common distractor.\n*   **Reagent Functionality:** It is essential to know the specific action of Red P + HI. It is a very strong reducing agent that completely reduces double bonds and oxygenated functional groups to their alkane counterparts, unlike milder reagents which might be more selective.\n*   **Ring Preservation:** The most stable part of the carbon skeleton, the ring, remains intact during this reduction. This preservation of the ring is the sole reason the final IHD is not zero.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe initial molecule has an IHD of 5 (1 ring + 4 pi bonds). The exhaustive reduction with Red P + HI eliminates all 4 pi bonds but preserves the 1 ring. Therefore, the final product has an IHD of 1. Matching this result with the given options:\n\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 5\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly interpret the name of the starting molecule, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, and calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates the presence of a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (a π bond) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group** (-CHO): This aldehyde group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group** (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π bond). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The IHD of the reactant is 5. Option **B) 5** is present in the list and acts as a distractor for those who calculate the IHD of the starting material instead of the final product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n\n*   **Function:** This combination is known in organic chemistry as a very powerful and *exhaustive* reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:**\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their respective alkyl groups (-CH₃). The oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   **Effect on Carbon Skeleton:** Critically, this reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** It is essential to recognize the exhaustive nature of Red P + HI. Weaker reducing agents would yield a different product with a different IHD.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and its IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   The four pi bonds (from the two C=C bonds and two C=O bonds) are all reduced to single bonds.\n*   The single six-membered ring remains.\n\nThe resulting product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. We can now calculate its IHD:\n\n*   **Number of rings in product:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds in product:** 0 (all pi bonds were removed by the reduction).\n\nThe IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The IHD is 1, not 0. The ring itself contributes one unit to the index of hydrogen deficiency. Option **A) 0** is incorrect as it implies the ring was also broken.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the reactant has an IHD of 5. After the exhaustive reduction with Red P and HI, all four pi bonds are eliminated, but the ring remains. The final product has an IHD of 1.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. All candidate answers correctly performed this initial analysis.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This signifies a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a C=C double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This group also contains a C=O double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the starting reactant is: 1 (ring) + 1 (ene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (acid) = **5**.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: The value \"5\" is present as option A. This is a common distractor representing the IHD of the starting material, not the product. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Molecule\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. As correctly and unanimously identified by all candidate answers, this is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n\n*   **Function**: It reduces a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n*   **Effect on Bonds**: It reduces all multiple bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds in the reactant will be eliminated.\n*   **Effect on Skeleton**: Crucially, this reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n**Careful Point 2**: The key is knowing the specific action of this strong reducing agent: it removes pi bonds and oxygen atoms but leaves the sigma bond framework, including rings, intact.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   **Reactant**: 1 ring, 4 pi bonds (IHD = 5)\n*   **Reaction**: Removes the 4 pi bonds.\n*   **Product**: 1 ring, 0 pi bonds.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Its IHD is calculated as:\n*   **Number of rings**: 1 (the six-membered ring remains).\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Careful Point 3**: The IHD is not 0. An IHD of 0 implies an acyclic, saturated molecule. Since the ring is preserved, the product must have an IHD of 1.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**. This result is supported by the unanimous chemical reasoning of all 15 candidate answers. The inconsistencies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidates were due to them being presented with different, randomly ordered options. Based on the chemical facts, the correct numerical answer is 1.\n\nMatching this value to the options provided in the question:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated value of 1 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first crucial step, which all candidate answers performed correctly, is to deconstruct the reactant molecule and calculate its IHD. The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Reactant**: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n*   **Sources of Unsaturation**:\n    *   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` backbone is a six-membered ring, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n    *   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:\n        1.  The `-3-ene` indicates a C=C double bond within the ring, contributing **+1**.\n        2.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond, contributing **+1**.\n        3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1**.\n        4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1**.\n*   **Initial IHD Calculation**: Summing these contributions gives an IHD for the reactant: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Structure**\n\nThe next step is to understand the chemical transformation. The reaction is with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reagent Identity**: As all candidate answers unanimously identified, Red P + excess HI is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n*   **Effect on Molecule**:\n    *   It reduces all pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means the four pi bonds identified in Step 1 are eliminated.\n    *   It completely reduces oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids to their corresponding hydrocarbon groups (i.e., -CHO and -COOH both become -CH₃).\n    *   Crucially, this reaction preserves the stable carbon ring skeleton. The ring itself is not opened.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product and Calculate its IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   **Product Structure**: The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is fully saturated, containing only single bonds, but still has the ring.\n*   **Final IHD Calculation**:\n    *   Number of rings = **1** (preserved from the reactant).\n    *   Number of pi bonds = **0** (all four were reduced).\n    *   The IHD of the product is therefore 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Reactant vs. Product**: The question asks for the IHD of the *product*. The IHD of the reactant is 5 (Option B), which is a common distractor.\n*   **Strength of Reagent**: The choice of Red P + HI is specific. A weaker reducing agent would not have reduced all functional groups and would have led to a different product with a different IHD. The comprehensive reduction to an alkane is key.\n*   **Ring Preservation**: The stability of the sigma bonds in the ring ensures it survives the reaction, carrying its +1 contribution to the IHD into the product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a unanimous and consistent chemical analysis across all candidate answers, the reaction reduces the four pi bonds of the starting material but preserves its single ring. The index of hydrogen deficiency for the final product is therefore **1**. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 0\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
