It began by enumerating the four possible answers (A: 20 MeV, B: 5 MeV, C: 10 MeV, D: 2 MeV) as the initial set of hypotheses.\n\nTo prune these hypotheses, it applied the constraints from physics. It calculated the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (198 GeV and 99 GeV) and the total kinetic energy released (3 GeV). It then calculated the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using both the correct relativistic formula and the classical approximation.\n\n-   The relativistic (correct) value for T1 was found to be 1.005 GeV.\n-   The classical (approximate) value for T1 was found to be 1.000 GeV.\n\nThe difference between these two values is 0.005 GeV, which is equivalent to 5.0 MeV.\n\nThis calculated result of 5.0 MeV was used to filter the initial hypotheses.

Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\nThe core task is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated using relativistic mechanics and the same value calculated using classical mechanics.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Let the fragments be `m1` (more massive) and `m2` (less massive).\n    *   Given: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Given: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Substituting `m1` in the second equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99*M` which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99*M`, so `m2 = 0.33*M`.\n    *   It follows that `m1 = 0.66*M`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m2*c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n    *   The Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect.\n    *   `Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m1*c² + m2*c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This total kinetic energy is shared between the fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum dictates that the fragments have momenta of equal magnitude: `p1 = p2`.\n    *   The ratio of their kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / 2m1) / (p² / 2m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Therefore, `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1.**\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    *   This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2*T*(mc²)`.\n    *   Since `p1 = p2`, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n        `T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`.\n    *   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c² = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c² = 99 GeV`:\n        `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n        `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n        `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   Solving for T1: `600*T1 = 603`, which gives `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Find the difference.**\n    *   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV): `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The vast majority of candidate answers that show their work (e.g., Answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly perform the physics calculations and arrive at the numerical result of 5 MeV. This high degree of consensus on the calculation itself strongly indicates its correctness.\n*   **Formula Application:** The correct formulas for both classical (`T = p²/2m`) and relativistic (`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`) energy-momentum relations were used. The application of conservation of energy (to find Q-value) and conservation of momentum (to relate T1 and T2) is fundamental and was applied correctly.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The final step of converting 0.005 GeV to 5 MeV is crucial and was performed correctly in the detailed answers.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** A significant point of error among the candidate answers was incorrectly mapping the final result (5 MeV) to the given lettered options. The options are A) 5 MeV, B) 20 MeV, C) 10 MeV, D) 2 MeV. The correct answer is A. Answers 2, 10, 12, and 15 correctly identify A. Many others (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11) calculate 5 MeV but select the wrong letter.\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nThe step-by-step derivation is robust and confirmed by the calculations in most of the provided answers. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the provided answers and identifying crucial points.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Conditions:**\n    *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll define `m₁` as the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThis process is consistently followed by the majority of the provided answers.\n\n**Step 2.1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nFrom this, we find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNow, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies using `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `E₁_rest = m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m₂`): `E₂_rest = m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2.2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released is the initial rest-mass energy minus the final total rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Mc²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum dictates that the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`:\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.4: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\nMomentum is also conserved in relativity (`p₁ = p₂`). The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nThis can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²) `\n\nSubstitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.5: Find the Difference**\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n`Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n### **3. Analysis of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The vast majority of the candidate answers that show their work (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) arrive at the same numerical result: a difference of 5 MeV.\n*   **Careful Points & Common Errors:** The primary point of failure among the candidate answers was not the calculation itself, but correctly matching the calculated value of 5 MeV to the corresponding option letter. The options are A) 5 MeV, B) 10 MeV, C) 2 MeV, and D) 20 MeV.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct calculated difference is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option A. Answers 2, 10, 12, and 15 correctly identify this. Many other answers perform the calculation correctly but select the wrong letter in their final output.\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the physics involved, here is a breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using two different physical models (relativistic and classical) and then find the difference between the results.\n\n**1. Careful Point: Determining Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nFirst, we must accurately calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial energy: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`, which implies `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`.\n*   Solving this system of two equations:\n    *   `(2 * m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (the lighter fragment)\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (the more massive fragment)\nThis step is performed correctly by almost all agents that show their work.\n\n**2. Careful Point: Calculating Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final rest-mass energy)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis value is also consistently calculated correctly by the agents.\n\n**3. Careful Point: The Classical Approximation**\nIn classical mechanics, for a system starting from rest, momentum conservation (`p₁ = p₂`) dictates that the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses.\n*   Classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n*   This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Careful Point: The Correct Relativistic Calculation**\nThis is the most complex step. Momentum is still conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy and momentum is different.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate this expression for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n    `T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)`\n*   Simplifying the equation:\n    `396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁`\n    `600*T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Careful Point: Final Difference and Unit Conversion**\nThe final step is to find the difference and ensure the units are correct.\n*   Difference = `T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The options are in MeV, so we must convert: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion on Candidate Answers\nThe majority of the candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly perform the detailed calculation and arrive at the numerical result of 5 MeV. However, a significant number of them then fail to select the correct option corresponding to their result. For example, Answer 2 calculates 5 MeV but outputs `<<<A>>>` (which is 2 MeV), and Answer 3 calculates 5 MeV but outputs `<<<C>>>` (which is 10 MeV).\n\nThe correct calculation leads to a difference of 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, a more massive one (`m1`) and a less massive one (`m2`).\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for the masses in terms of M and then find their rest-mass energies.\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies using the initial energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n        `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`):\n        `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p1 = p2`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   **Solve for T1_classical:** Use the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc^2`, so `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   **Momentum in terms of T:** We can rearrange the relation to `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n*   **Set up the Equation:** Since the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   **Solve for T1:** Substitute `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1` and the rest-mass energies:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Finally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and an independent step-by-step verification of the physics problem, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires calculating the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using both relativistic and classical mechanics and then finding the difference.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States & Calculate Fragment Masses**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2` (m1 is the more massive fragment).\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   From the conditions, we can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\n    *   `m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `m1c² = 2 * m2c²` into the sum: `2*m2c² + m2c² = 297 GeV`, which gives `3*m2c² = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\n*   The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final rest-mass energy)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / 2m1) / (p² / 2m2) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` -> `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is `T + mc²`.\n*   This gives the relation for momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`:\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(m1c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1c² = 198 GeV`, and `m2c² = 99 GeV`.\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The difference is `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert this to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Conservation Laws:** The correct application of both conservation of energy (to find the 3 GeV Q-value) and conservation of momentum (to relate the energies of the two fragments) is essential.\n2.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Formulas:** It is critical to use the distinct formulas for kinetic energy in each regime. The classical `T = p²/2m` leads to `T1/T2 = m2/m1`, while the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)` is needed for the correct value.\n3.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation involves solving an equation where terms cancel. Careful algebraic manipulation is required to arrive at the correct `600*T1 = 603`.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The problem is solved in GeV, but the options are in MeV. The final conversion step (`0.005 GeV = 5 MeV`) is a crucial last step.\n5.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** A review of the provided answers shows that while most perform the calculation correctly to arrive at 5 MeV, they often select the wrong final letter option. Only Answer 9 correctly calculates the value and selects the corresponding option D.\n\nThe correct difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Properties**\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   From the given conditions, we can write the energies as:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (Mc^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n*   Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculation of T1 (Classical Approximation)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T_cl = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n    Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   **Solving for T1_cl:**\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculation of T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc^2`, so `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   **Momentum Expression:** We can write `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   **Solving for T1:** Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Final Difference Calculation**\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    `ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation consistently shows that the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for T1 is 5 MeV. Reviewing the candidate answers, most perform the calculation correctly, but several fail to map the result of 5 MeV to the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n*   A) 2 MeV\n*   B) 20 MeV\n*   C) 5 MeV\n*   D) 10 MeV\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method, even if the final letter choice varies. Let's break down the problem step-by-step to verify the correct result.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll define `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated relativistically (the correct value) and classically (the approximation).\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 2.1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `E1_rest = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`): `E2_rest = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2.2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1_rest + E2_rest)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.3: Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2`).\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_class / T2_class = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_class = 2 * T1_class`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_class + T2_class = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_class + 2*T1_class = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_class = 3 GeV`\n`T1_class = 1 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.4: Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\nMomentum is still conserved (`p1 = p2`). The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nWe can express the momentum term as `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince total energy `E = T + m*c^2`, this becomes `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we can equate the momentum terms for both fragments:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.5: Find the Difference**\nThe difference is `T1_rel - T1_class`.\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n### **3. Conclusion from Analysis**\n\nThe detailed calculation confirms that the difference is 5 MeV.\n*   Most agents (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly perform the calculation steps.\n*   Agents 1, 6, and 11 correctly map this result to option B.\n*   Many other agents perform the calculation correctly but make a mistake in selecting the final letter option. For example, Answer 2 calculates 5 MeV but chooses A (10 MeV), and Answer 3 calculates 5 MeV but chooses C (2 MeV).\n*   The overwhelming consensus on the calculation itself points to 5 MeV as the correct numerical answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Plan\n1.

Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nA review of the 15 candidate answers reveals two key points:\n\n*   **Strong Consensus on Calculation:** The vast majority of answers that show their work (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) follow the same physical principles and algebraic steps. They all correctly determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments (198 GeV and 99 GeV), the total kinetic energy released (3 GeV), the classical kinetic energy of the massive fragment (1 GeV), and the relativistic kinetic energy (1.005 GeV). This leads to a unanimous calculated difference of **5 MeV**.\n\n*   **Widespread Inconsistency:** Despite the consensus on the 5 MeV result, most of the answers select a final letter that does not match their own calculation. For example, Answer 1 calculates 5 MeV but concludes `<<<B>>>` (20 MeV), and Answer 2 calculates 5 MeV but concludes `<<<A>>>` (2 MeV). This indicates a likely error in mapping the numerical result to the correct option letter.\n\nOnly a few answers are internally consistent. **Answer 9** correctly calculates the difference as 5 MeV and correctly selects `<<<D>>>`, which corresponds to 5 MeV.\n\n**2.

The initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energies plus the kinetic energies of the fragments. The difference in rest-mass energy is the Q-value, or total kinetic energy released.\n4.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n5.  **Formulas:** The correct formulas for both classical (`T = p²/2m`) and relativistic (`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`) kinetic energy must be used.\n6.  **Algebra:** The algebraic solution for the relativistic kinetic energy `T1` must be performed without error.\n7.  **Units:** The calculations are most easily performed in GeV, but the final answer must be converted to MeV, as per the options.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Total final rest-mass energy is `(m1 + m2)c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We have the system of equations:\n        *   `m1c² + m2c² = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m1c² = 2 * m2c²`\n    *   Solving this gives:\n        *   `3 * m2c² = 297 GeV` => `m2c² = 99 GeV`.\n        *   `m1c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   The Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect.\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation):**\n    *   From conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`), the classical kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T1_class / T2_class = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   This means `T2_class = 2 * T1_class`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_class + 2*T1_class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * T1_class = 3 GeV` => `T1_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value):**\n    *   From conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`), we equate the relativistic momentum expressions: `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`.\n    *   `T1² + 2*T1*(m1c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2c²)`.\n    *   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1c² = 198`, and `m2c² = 99`:\n    *   `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1²` terms cancel.\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_class = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers that show their work perform the calculation correctly and arrive at a difference of 5 MeV.

Evaluation of Candidate Answers**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The overwhelming majority of candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly perform the detailed calculation and arrive at the result of **5 MeV**.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** There is a significant discrepancy where many agents calculate 5 MeV but then select a final answer letter that does not correspond to 5 MeV based on the provided options (A=20, B=2, C=5, D=10).\n    *   **Correctly Matched:** Answers 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 all calculate 5 MeV and correctly identify it as option C.\n    *   **Incorrectly Matched:** Answers 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15 all calculate 5 MeV but choose an incorrect letter (A, B, or D).\n    *   **Other:** Answer 13 provides a different mapping of options but correctly associates its choice with 5 MeV. Answer 14 is an outlier with an incorrect result.\n\n### **3.

The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV. Based on the options provided in the prompt, 5 MeV corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m₁` (more massive) and `m₂` (less massive).\n*   **Conditions:**\n    *   `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics and the value calculated using classical mechanics.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThis analysis follows the consensus approach seen in the majority of the detailed candidate answers.\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n    *   From the given conditions, we can set up a system of equations for the rest-mass energies:\n        1. `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n        2. `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n    *   Substituting the first equation into the second gives: `2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for the energies:\n        *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n        *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   This step is performed correctly and consistently across all detailed answers.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n    *   The Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final rest-mass energy)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This result is also consistent across all detailed answers.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n    *   This calculation is a point of universal agreement among the candidates that show their work.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the correct (relativistic) T₁.**\n    *   Momentum is also conserved in relativity (`p₁ = p₂`).\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for both fragments:\n        `T₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n        `T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)`\n    *   Simplifying the equation leads to:\n        `396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁`\n        `600*T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This result is also consistently derived in all detailed solutions.\n\n*   **Step 5: Find the difference.**\n    *   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Converting to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n        `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **3.

The correct option for 5 MeV is C.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and identifying key points for accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n        *   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2 * m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n        *   Sum of final rest-masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   From the given relationships, we can find the fragments' masses in terms of `M`. Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n        *   This means `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n    *   **Rest-Mass Energies:**\n        *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This step is foundational. All subsequent calculations depend on these values. All agents who performed this calculation did so correctly.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n    *   **Concept:** The Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy, according to `E=mc²`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   `Q = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final total rest-mass energy)`\n        *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n        *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`. This is also consistently calculated correctly.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n    *   **Concept:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum dictates that the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`). In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n        *   `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n        *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV` -> `T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`.\n        *   `3 * T₁_cl = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_cl = 1 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This establishes the baseline approximate value.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n    *   **Concept:** Momentum is still conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n        *   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n        *   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n        *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n        *   The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n        *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        *   `600T₁ = 603`\n        *   `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The algebra here is the most complex part of the problem and must be done carefully. The derivation is consistent across almost all candidate answers.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference and Final Answer**\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n        *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Unit Conversion:** The options are in MeV, so we must convert. `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n        *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n    *   **Mapping to Options:**\n        *   A) 5 MeV\n        *   B) 2 MeV\n        *   C) 10 MeV\n        *   D) 20 MeV\n    *   The calculated difference of 5 MeV matches option A.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nThe overwhelming majority of the agents correctly calculated the numerical answer to be 5 MeV. However, many of them incorrectly mapped this result to the lettered options (e.g., stating the answer is 5 MeV but choosing `<<<B>>>` or `<<<C>>>`). The correct calculation leads to 5 MeV, which is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers, here is a definitive solution to the problem, highlighting the critical points of the calculation.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement and Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, a more massive one (`m₁`) and a less massive one (`m₂`).\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment is twice the mass of the lighter one: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step was performed correctly and consistently across almost all candidate answers.\n\n1.  A system of two equations is established:\n    *   `m₁ = 2m₂`\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n2.  Substituting the first equation into the second yields: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  From this, `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n4.  The rest-mass energies are then calculated:\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nA crucial point here is the application of the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n\n1.  In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n2.  The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to their masses: `T₁/T₂ = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁`.\n3.  Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `T₁/T₂ = 1/2`, which means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n4.  Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n5.  Substituting `T₂ = 2T₁` gives `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, so `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n6.  Therefore, the classical kinetic energy is `T₁ (classical) = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n\n1.  Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds.\n2.  The momentum term can be expressed as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since total energy `E = T + mc²`, this becomes `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n3.  Equating the momentum terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n4.  Substitute the known values: `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, simplifying the equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n6.  Solving for the relativistic kinetic energy: `T₁ (relativistic) = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert the units as required by the options.\n\n*   **Difference** = `T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion on Candidate Answers**\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while the overwhelming majority performed the physics calculations correctly to arrive at the 5 MeV result, many failed in the final step of selecting the corresponding option letter.

Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\nThe core task is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated using relativistic mechanics and the same value calculated using classical mechanics.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Let the fragments be `m1` (more massive) and `m2` (less massive).\n    *   Given: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Given: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Substituting `m1` in the second equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99*M` which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99*M`, so `m2 = 0.33*M`.\n    *   It follows that `m1 = 0.66*M`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m2*c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n    *   The Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect.\n    *   `Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m1*c² + m2*c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This total kinetic energy is shared between the fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum dictates that the fragments have momenta of equal magnitude: `p1 = p2`.\n    *   The ratio of their kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / 2m1) / (p² / 2m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Therefore, `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1.**\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    *   This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2*T*(mc²)`.\n    *   Since `p1 = p2`, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n        `T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`.\n    *   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c² = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c² = 99 GeV`:\n        `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n        `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n        `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   Solving for T1: `600*T1 = 603`, which gives `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Find the difference.**\n    *   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV): `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The vast majority of candidate answers that show their work (e.g., Answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly perform the physics calculations and arrive at the numerical result of 5 MeV. This high degree of consensus on the calculation itself strongly indicates its correctness.\n*   **Formula Application:** The correct formulas for both classical (`T = p²/2m`) and relativistic (`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`) energy-momentum relations were used. The application of conservation of energy (to find Q-value) and conservation of momentum (to relate T1 and T2) is fundamental and was applied correctly.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The final step of converting 0.005 GeV to 5 MeV is crucial and was performed correctly in the detailed answers.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** A significant point of error among the candidate answers was incorrectly mapping the final result (5 MeV) to the given lettered options. The options are A) 5 MeV, B) 20 MeV, C) 10 MeV, D) 2 MeV. The correct answer is A. Answers 2, 10, 12, and 15 correctly identify A. Many others (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11) calculate 5 MeV but select the wrong letter.\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nThe step-by-step derivation is robust and confirmed by the calculations in most of the provided answers. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the provided answers and identifying crucial points.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Conditions:**\n    *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll define `m₁` as the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThis process is consistently followed by the majority of the provided answers.\n\n**Step 2.1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nFrom this, we find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNow, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies using `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `E₁_rest = m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m₂`): `E₂_rest = m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2.2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released is the initial rest-mass energy minus the final total rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Mc²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum dictates that the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`\nSo, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`:\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.4: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\nMomentum is also conserved in relativity (`p₁ = p₂`). The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nThis can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc²`) as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²) `\n\nSubstitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.5: Find the Difference**\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n`Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n### **3. Analysis of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The vast majority of the candidate answers that show their work (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) arrive at the same numerical result: a difference of 5 MeV.\n*   **Careful Points & Common Errors:** The primary point of failure among the candidate answers was not the calculation itself, but correctly matching the calculated value of 5 MeV to the corresponding option letter. The options are A) 5 MeV, B) 10 MeV, C) 2 MeV, and D) 20 MeV.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct calculated difference is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option A. Answers 2, 10, 12, and 15 correctly identify this. Many other answers perform the calculation correctly but select the wrong letter in their final output.\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the physics involved, here is a breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using two different physical models (relativistic and classical) and then find the difference between the results.\n\n**1. Careful Point: Determining Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nFirst, we must accurately calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial energy: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`, which implies `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`.\n*   Solving this system of two equations:\n    *   `(2 * m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (the lighter fragment)\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (the more massive fragment)\nThis step is performed correctly by almost all agents that show their work.\n\n**2. Careful Point: Calculating Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe energy released from the mass defect is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final rest-mass energy)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis value is also consistently calculated correctly by the agents.\n\n**3. Careful Point: The Classical Approximation**\nIn classical mechanics, for a system starting from rest, momentum conservation (`p₁ = p₂`) dictates that the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses.\n*   Classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio is `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n*   This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we get `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This yields `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Careful Point: The Correct Relativistic Calculation**\nThis is the most complex step. Momentum is still conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), but the relationship between energy and momentum is different.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate this expression for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n    `T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)`\n*   Simplifying the equation:\n    `396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁`\n    `600*T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Careful Point: Final Difference and Unit Conversion**\nThe final step is to find the difference and ensure the units are correct.\n*   Difference = `T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The options are in MeV, so we must convert: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion on Candidate Answers\nThe majority of the candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly perform the detailed calculation and arrive at the numerical result of 5 MeV. However, a significant number of them then fail to select the correct option corresponding to their result. For example, Answer 2 calculates 5 MeV but outputs `<<<A>>>` (which is 2 MeV), and Answer 3 calculates 5 MeV but outputs `<<<C>>>` (which is 10 MeV).\n\nThe correct calculation leads to a difference of 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, a more massive one (`m1`) and a less massive one (`m2`).\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for the masses in terms of M and then find their rest-mass energies.\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n3.  Calculate the rest-mass energies using the initial energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n        `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`):\n        `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p1 = p2`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   **Solve for T1_classical:** Use the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc^2`, so `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   **Momentum in terms of T:** We can rearrange the relation to `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n*   **Set up the Equation:** Since the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   **Solve for T1:** Substitute `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1` and the rest-mass energies:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Finally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and an independent step-by-step verification of the physics problem, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires calculating the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using both relativistic and classical mechanics and then finding the difference.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States & Calculate Fragment Masses**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2` (m1 is the more massive fragment).\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   From the conditions, we can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\n    *   `m1c² + m2c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `m1c² = 2 * m2c²` into the sum: `2*m2c² + m2c² = 297 GeV`, which gives `3*m2c² = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\n*   The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final rest-mass energy)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / 2m1) / (p² / 2m2) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` -> `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is `T + mc²`.\n*   This gives the relation for momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`:\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(m1c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1c² = 198 GeV`, and `m2c² = 99 GeV`.\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The difference is `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert this to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Conservation Laws:** The correct application of both conservation of energy (to find the 3 GeV Q-value) and conservation of momentum (to relate the energies of the two fragments) is essential.\n2.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Formulas:** It is critical to use the distinct formulas for kinetic energy in each regime. The classical `T = p²/2m` leads to `T1/T2 = m2/m1`, while the relativistic `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)` is needed for the correct value.\n3.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation involves solving an equation where terms cancel. Careful algebraic manipulation is required to arrive at the correct `600*T1 = 603`.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The problem is solved in GeV, but the options are in MeV. The final conversion step (`0.005 GeV = 5 MeV`) is a crucial last step.\n5.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** A review of the provided answers shows that while most perform the calculation correctly to arrive at 5 MeV, they often select the wrong final letter option. Only Answer 9 correctly calculates the value and selects the corresponding option D.\n\nThe correct difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Properties**\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   From the given conditions, we can write the energies as:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (Mc^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n*   Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculation of T1 (Classical Approximation)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T_cl = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n    Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   **Solving for T1_cl:**\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculation of T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc^2`, so `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   **Momentum Expression:** We can write `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   **Solving for T1:** Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Final Difference Calculation**\n\n*   **Difference:** `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    `ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation consistently shows that the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for T1 is 5 MeV. Reviewing the candidate answers, most perform the calculation correctly, but several fail to map the result of 5 MeV to the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n*   A) 2 MeV\n*   B) 20 MeV\n*   C) 5 MeV\n*   D) 10 MeV\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method, even if the final letter choice varies. Let's break down the problem step-by-step to verify the correct result.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll define `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated relativistically (the correct value) and classically (the approximation).\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 2.1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `E1_rest = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`): `E2_rest = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2.2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy becomes the total kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1_rest + E2_rest)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.3: Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2`).\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_class / T2_class = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_class = 2 * T1_class`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_class + T2_class = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_class + 2*T1_class = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_class = 3 GeV`\n`T1_class = 1 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.4: Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\nMomentum is still conserved (`p1 = p2`). The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nWe can express the momentum term as `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince total energy `E = T + m*c^2`, this becomes `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we can equate the momentum terms for both fragments:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Step 2.5: Find the Difference**\nThe difference is `T1_rel - T1_class`.\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n### **3. Conclusion from Analysis**\n\nThe detailed calculation confirms that the difference is 5 MeV.\n*   Most agents (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) correctly perform the calculation steps.\n*   Agents 1, 6, and 11 correctly map this result to option B.\n*   Many other agents perform the calculation correctly but make a mistake in selecting the final letter option. For example, Answer 2 calculates 5 MeV but chooses A (10 MeV), and Answer 3 calculates 5 MeV but chooses C (2 MeV).\n*   The overwhelming consensus on the calculation itself points to 5 MeV as the correct numerical answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Plan\n1.  Analyze the provided candidate answers to find a consensus on the calculation method and the numerical result.\n2.  Identify any inconsistencies between the calculated results and the final letter choices within the candidate answers.\n3.  Perform an independent, step-by-step verification of the calculation to confirm the correct numerical answer.\n4.  Match the verified numerical answer to the given options (A, B, C, D) to determine the final correct choice.\n\n### Execution\n\n**1. Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nA review of the 15 candidate answers reveals two key points:\n\n*   **Strong Consensus on Calculation:** The vast majority of answers that show their work (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) follow the same physical principles and algebraic steps. They all correctly determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments (198 GeV and 99 GeV), the total kinetic energy released (3 GeV), the classical kinetic energy of the massive fragment (1 GeV), and the relativistic kinetic energy (1.005 GeV). This leads to a unanimous calculated difference of **5 MeV**.\n\n*   **Widespread Inconsistency:** Despite the consensus on the 5 MeV result, most of the answers select a final letter that does not match their own calculation. For example, Answer 1 calculates 5 MeV but concludes `<<<B>>>` (20 MeV), and Answer 2 calculates 5 MeV but concludes `<<<A>>>` (2 MeV).

Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n        *   This means `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n    *   **Rest-Mass Energies:**\n        *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This step is foundational. All subsequent calculations depend on these values. All agents who performed this calculation did so correctly.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n    *   **Concept:** The Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy, according to `E=mc²`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   `Q = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final total rest-mass energy)`\n        *   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n        *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`. This is also consistently calculated correctly.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n    *   **Concept:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum dictates that the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`). In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n        *   `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n        *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV` -> `T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`.\n        *   `3 * T₁_cl = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_cl = 1 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This establishes the baseline approximate value.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n    *   **Concept:** Momentum is still conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Since `p₁ = p₂`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n        *   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n        *   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n        *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n        *   The `T₁²` terms cancel out.\n        *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        *   `600T₁ = 603`\n        *   `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The algebra here is the most complex part of the problem and must be done carefully. The derivation is consistent across almost all candidate answers.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference and Final Answer**\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   `Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n        *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   **Unit Conversion:** The options are in MeV, so we must convert. `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n        *   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n    *   **Mapping to Options:**\n        *   A) 5 MeV\n        *   B) 2 MeV\n        *   C) 10 MeV\n        *   D) 20 MeV\n    *   The calculated difference of 5 MeV matches option A.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nThe overwhelming majority of the agents correctly calculated the numerical answer to be 5 MeV. However, many of them incorrectly mapped this result to the lettered options (e.g., stating the answer is 5 MeV but choosing `<<<B>>>` or `<<<C>>>`). The correct calculation leads to 5 MeV, which is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers, here is a definitive solution to the problem, highlighting the critical points of the calculation.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement and Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, a more massive one (`m₁`) and a less massive one (`m₂`).\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment is twice the mass of the lighter one: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nThis step was performed correctly and consistently across almost all candidate answers.\n\n1.  A system of two equations is established:\n    *   `m₁ = 2m₂`\n    *   `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n2.  Substituting the first equation into the second yields: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  From this, `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n4.  The rest-mass energies are then calculated:\n    *   More massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nA crucial point here is the application of the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n\n1.  In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n2.  The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to their masses: `T₁/T₂ = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁`.\n3.  Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `T₁/T₂ = 1/2`, which means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n4.  Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n5.  Substituting `T₂ = 2T₁` gives `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, so `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n6.  Therefore, the classical kinetic energy is `T₁ (classical) = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nThis is the most complex step and requires the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n\n1.  Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) still holds.\n2.  The momentum term can be expressed as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since total energy `E = T + mc²`, this becomes `(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n3.  Equating the momentum terms for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n4.  Substitute the known values: `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n5.  The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out, simplifying the equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n6.  Solving for the relativistic kinetic energy: `T₁ (relativistic) = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference and convert the units as required by the options.\n\n*   **Difference** = `T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   **Difference** = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion on Candidate Answers**\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while the overwhelming majority performed the physics calculations correctly to arrive at the 5 MeV result, many failed in the final step of selecting the corresponding option letter. For instance, Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 15 all calculate the correct value but select an incorrect letter.
