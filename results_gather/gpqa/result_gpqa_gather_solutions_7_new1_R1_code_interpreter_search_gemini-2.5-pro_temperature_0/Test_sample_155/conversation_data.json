The corresponding stereochemical rule states that this combination results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is crucial:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will appear as **one peak**.

This corresponds to option B.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most of them correctly deduce the chemical outcome (2 peaks and 3 peaks), many incorrectly map this result to the given options. The correct chemical reasoning leads unambiguously to the answer described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₃O⁺. This sequence is known as *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the *anti*-addition of two groups to a *trans*-alkene is that it produces a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Mechanism verification:** The *syn*-epoxidation of the *trans*-alkene creates a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)). The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on either of these enantiomers leads to the formation of the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product is a meso compound because it is achiral despite having two stereocenters (it possesses a center of inversion).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the *anti*-addition of two groups to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   **Mechanism verification:** The *syn*-epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene creates the *cis*-epoxide, which is a meso compound. The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this achiral meso-epoxide can occur at two different carbons, leading to two different products that are mirror images of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Since the starting materials are achiral, these enantiomers are formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The racemic pair will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso compound will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks observed: 2**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture, separating the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as a **third peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks observed: 3**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Chemical Problem:** The task is to determine the number of unique compounds produced from two separate reactions and then figure out how many peaks these compounds would generate on two different types of HPLC columns.\n\n2.  **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (trans-alkene)**\n    *   The reaction sequence is mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   A key stereochemical rule is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis-alkene)**\n    *   The reaction sequence is the same: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The corresponding stereochemical rule is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces two compounds that are enantiomers of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   The relationship between these is crucial: The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the other two, while the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n5.  **Predict the Chromatograms:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n        *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Result:** 1 peak (for the meso compound) + 1 peak (for the co-eluting enantiomers) = **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n        *   It will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), into two distinct peaks.\n        *   It will also separate the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the others).\n        *   **Result:** 1 peak (meso) + 1 peak (4R,5R) + 1 peak (4S,5S) = **3 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The analysis shows 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.

This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₃O⁺. This sequence is known as *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the *anti*-addition of two groups to a *trans*-alkene is that it produces a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Mechanism verification:** The *syn*-epoxidation of the *trans*-alkene creates a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)). The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on either of these enantiomers leads to the formation of the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product is a meso compound because it is achiral despite having two stereocenters (it possesses a center of inversion).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the *anti*-addition of two groups to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   **Mechanism verification:** The *syn*-epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene creates the *cis*-epoxide, which is a meso compound. The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this achiral meso-epoxide can occur at two different carbons, leading to two different products that are mirror images of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Since the starting materials are achiral, these enantiomers are formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The racemic pair will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.

This is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   A key stereochemical rule is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis-alkene)**\n    *   The reaction sequence is the same: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The corresponding stereochemical rule is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces two compounds that are enantiomers of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   The relationship between these is crucial: The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the other two, while the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n5.  **Predict the Chromatograms:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n        *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Result:** 1 peak (for the meso compound) + 1 peak (for the co-eluting enantiomers) = **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n        *   It will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), into two distinct peaks.\n        *   It will also separate the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the others).\n        *   **Result:** 1 peak (meso) + 1 peak (4R,5R) + 1 peak (4S,5S) = **3 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The analysis shows 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.

The net result is the addition of two hydroxyl groups in an *anti* configuration across the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n*   **Product 1:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Process:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product 2:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated. The racemic pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture, separating the (4R,5R)-diol from the (4S,5S)-diol. This will produce two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Mechanism:** This two-step sequence is a net *anti*-dihydroxylation. The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn*-addition that forms a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening, is an *anti*-attack by water.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for this transformation is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) is treated with the same reagents.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is also a net *anti*-dihydroxylation. The *syn*-epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene forms a *meso*-epoxide. The subsequent *anti*-attack by water opens this epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for this transformation is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic mixture*.\n*   **Product 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions.

They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and a second peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column separates enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral phase.\n    *   It also separates diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.
