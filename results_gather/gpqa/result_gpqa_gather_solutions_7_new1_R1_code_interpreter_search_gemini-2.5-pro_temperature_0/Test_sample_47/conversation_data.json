Determine the Reaction Pathway and Final Product (Product 4)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-Bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\n    This is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α' position) undergoes a ring contraction when treated with a strong base. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring carboxylic acid derivative.\n    *   **Product 2 is Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), pyridine → Product 3**\n    This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride. The -OH group is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**\n    This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\nThe consensus among all correct analyses is that the final product is **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, we must analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and the C1-H bond. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring. Hydrogens that are reflections of each other across this plane are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. It is the only one of its kind. (This is **1** type).\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is also unique. (This is a **2nd** type).\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are **diastereotopic**—they are not chemically equivalent because of their different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group. The same is true for the protons on C5. Therefore, the two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, but the cis set is distinct from the trans set. This gives **2** more types of hydrogens.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives another **2** types of hydrogens.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5-H (one set of 2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5-H (the other set of 2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4-H (one set of 2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4-H (the other set of 2 protons)\n\nSumming these up, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1\n*   **Reaction**: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Analysis**: This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1**: 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly identify this product.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2\n*   **Reaction**: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis**: This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base, known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by ring-opening and rearrangement. For a cyclic ketone like this, the result is a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Product 2**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly identify this reaction and the resulting product.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3\n*   **Reaction**: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Analysis**: This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n*   **Product 3**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly identify this product.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4\n*   **Reaction**: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Analysis**: This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive functional groups like acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4**: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly identify this final product.\n\n### Step 5: Count the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4\n*   **Structure**: The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, which consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: To count the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. On the NMR timescale, the rapid puckering of the cyclopentane ring results in an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Counting the unique hydrogen environments**:\n    1.  **Aldehyde proton**: The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1 proton**: The single proton on the ring carbon (C1) attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2/C5 protons**: The plane of symmetry makes the two carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the rest of the molecule). Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3/C4 protons**: Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. These four protons are also divided into two distinct sets. (2 types)\n*   **Total Count**: Summing the distinct types gives 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and consistently leads to the conclusion that there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, the product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction of Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. The conditions, specifically the presence of an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (C6), are perfect for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Mechanism:** The base removes a proton from C6, forming an enolate. The enolate then attacks C2, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The base then attacks the carbonyl, and the ring opens to form a more stable five-membered ring with a carboxylate group.\n*   **Product 2:** After protonation (implied before the next step), the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.

However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group). Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. This gives two sets of equivalent protons for these positions. (2 types)\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent due to symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two sets of equivalent protons.

However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**—they are not chemically equivalent because of their different spatial relationships to the substituent on C1. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent.

This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. All candidate answers correctly identify the product as **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. All candidates correctly identify this as a **Favorskii rearrangement**, which involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**.\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. All candidates correctly identify the product as **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**.\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. All candidates correctly identify the final product as **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of Product 4 to count the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** On the NMR timescale, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the opposite C-C bond (C3-C4).\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. It is the only aldehyde proton in the molecule. This accounts for **1** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group lies on the plane of symmetry and is also unique. This accounts for a **2nd** type of hydrogen.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**—they are not chemically equivalent because of their different spatial relationships to the substituent on C1. One set of protons is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. The two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2** distinct types of hydrogens.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of distinct hydrogen atoms.**\n\nSumming the distinct types:\n*   1 (aldehyde proton)\n*   1 (C1 proton)\n*   2 (from C2/C5 protons)\n*   2 (from C3/C4 protons)\n*   **Total = 6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Step 4: Match the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated number of distinct hydrogens is 6.

The consensus among all candidate answers for each step is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂).**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon undergoes a ring contraction in the presence of a strong base.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The base forms an enolate, which then forms a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is attacked by the base, and the ring opens to form a more stable, ring-contracted carboxylate.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).**\n    *   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe chemical reasoning for this reaction sequence is sound and consistent across all provided answers. The final product is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments.

Determine the Reaction Pathway and Final Product (Product 4)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-Bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\n    This is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α' position) undergoes a ring contraction when treated with a strong base. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring carboxylic acid derivative.\n    *   **Product 2 is Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), pyridine → Product 3**\n    This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride. The -OH group is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**\n    This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\nThe consensus among all correct analyses is that the final product is **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, we must analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and the C1-H bond. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring. Hydrogens that are reflections of each other across this plane are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. It is the only one of its kind. (This is **1** type).\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is also unique. (This is a **2nd** type).\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are **diastereotopic**—they are not chemically equivalent because of their different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group. The same is true for the protons on C5. Therefore, the two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, but the cis set is distinct from the trans set. This gives **2** more types of hydrogens.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives another **2** types of hydrogens.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5-H (one set of 2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5-H (the other set of 2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4-H (one set of 2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4-H (the other set of 2 protons)\n\nSumming these up, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1\n*   **Reaction**: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Analysis**: This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1**: 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly identify this product.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2\n*   **Reaction**: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis**: This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base, known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by ring-opening and rearrangement. For a cyclic ketone like this, the result is a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Product 2**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly identify this reaction and the resulting product.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3\n*   **Reaction**: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Analysis**: This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n*   **Product 3**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly identify this product.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 4\n*   **Reaction**: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Analysis**: This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive functional groups like acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4**: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly identify this final product.\n\n### Step 5: Count the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4\n*   **Structure**: The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, which consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: To count the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. On the NMR timescale, the rapid puckering of the cyclopentane ring results in an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Counting the unique hydrogen environments**:\n    1.  **Aldehyde proton**: The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1 proton**: The single proton on the ring carbon (C1) attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2/C5 protons**: The plane of symmetry makes the two carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the rest of the molecule). Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3/C4 protons**: Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. These four protons are also divided into two distinct sets. (2 types)\n*   **Total Count**: Summing the distinct types gives 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and consistently leads to the conclusion that there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The provided options are A) 10, B) 8, C) 6, and D) 7. The correct answer is 6, which corresponds to option C.

A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, the product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction of Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. The conditions, specifically the presence of an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (C6), are perfect for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Mechanism:** The base removes a proton from C6, forming an enolate. The enolate then attacks C2, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The base then attacks the carbonyl, and the ring opens to form a more stable five-membered ring with a carboxylate group.\n*   **Product 2:** After protonation (implied before the next step), the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction of Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.

The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we look for non-equivalent proton environments. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n*   **Counting the distinct sets of hydrogens:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique environment.

(1 type)\n    3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group). Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. This gives two sets of equivalent protons for these positions. (2 types)\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent due to symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two sets of equivalent protons.

Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n*   Hydrogens that are in different chemical environments and cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation are considered distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**—they are not chemically equivalent because of their different spatial relationships to the substituent on C1. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is consistent and sound, leading to the conclusion that there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

The correct answer is 6, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the final product to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, the reaction yields a single major product.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\nThis is a classic reaction known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon is treated with a strong base, it undergoes a rearrangement that results in ring contraction.

This is done by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the bond between the two furthest carbons (C3 and C4). This symmetry makes certain hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they have a different spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule). Therefore, the two \"cis\" hydrogens (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other, but the cis and trans sets are distinct. This gives **2 more distinct types** of hydrogens.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\nCounting the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThe first step is the α-halogenation of a ketone.

This is done by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon atom it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1.

However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they have a different spatial relationship to the aldehyde group). Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. The two \"cis\" hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. This gives **2** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent.

This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. All candidate answers correctly identify the product as **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. All candidates correctly identify this as a **Favorskii rearrangement**, which involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**.\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. All candidates correctly identify the product as **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**.\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. All candidates correctly identify the final product as **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of Product 4 to count the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** On the NMR timescale, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the opposite C-C bond (C3-C4).\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. It is the only aldehyde proton in the molecule. This accounts for **1** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group lies on the plane of symmetry and is also unique. This accounts for a **2nd** type of hydrogen.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**—they are not chemically equivalent because of their different spatial relationships to the substituent on C1. One set of protons is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. The two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2** distinct types of hydrogens.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of distinct hydrogen atoms.**\n\nSumming the distinct types:\n*   1 (aldehyde proton)\n*   1 (C1 proton)\n*   2 (from C2/C5 protons)\n*   2 (from C3/C4 protons)\n*   **Total = 6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Step 4: Match the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated number of distinct hydrogens is 6. The options are:\nA) 6\nB) 7\nC) 10\nD) 8\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**Part 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. The consensus among all candidate answers for each step is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂).**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon undergoes a ring contraction in the presence of a strong base.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The base forms an enolate, which then forms a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is attacked by the base, and the ring opens to form a more stable, ring-contracted carboxylate.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).**\n    *   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe chemical reasoning for this reaction sequence is sound and consistent across all provided answers. The final product is unequivocally **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Part 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments. This is a question of molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and the C1-H bond.

It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n3.  **The C2/C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the two carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not chemically equivalent because they have a different spatial relationship to the substituent on C1. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are split into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons each. (2 types)\n4.  **The C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic.
