Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**\nThe problem involves double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system is related to its orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of its component stars (K₁ and K₂). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM_total = M₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / (2πG * sin³(i))\n\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n**3. Use the \"Eclipsing\" Clue**\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems are \"eclipsing\". For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) = 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly, as the `sin³(i)` term can be ignored.\n\n**4. Set Up the Mass Ratio**\nWith the simplified formula, the total mass is proportional to `P * (K₁ + K₂)³`. We can set up a ratio to compare the two systems:\n\nM_system1 / M_system2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\nThe constant of proportionality `1/(2πG)` cancels out.\n\n**5.

For eclipses to occur, the system's orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. Consequently, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and the `sin³(i)` term in the full mass formula can be ignored.\n\n4.  **The Simplified Formula:** Due to the eclipsing nature of the systems, the total mass (M_total) is directly proportional to the orbital period (P) multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes (K_total = K₁ + K₂).\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³`\n\n5.  **Setting up the Ratio:** To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we create a ratio of their masses. The constants of proportionality cancel out.\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_total₁ / K_total₂)³`\n\n6.  **Substituting the Given Values:**\n    *   **For System 1:**\n        *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n        *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **For System 2:**\n        *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n        *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Calculation:** All candidate answers perform the same correct calculation.\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³`\n    *   Simplify the fraction: `15 / 25 = 3 / 5`\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n8.  **Conclusion and Comparison with Options:** The calculated ratio is 0.432.

This is a critical piece of information. For eclipses to be observed, the orbital plane must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. When i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass formula significantly, as the `sin³(i)` term can be ignored.\n\n4.  **Establish the Proportionality:** With the simplification from the eclipsing nature of the systems, the total mass becomes directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n5.  **Set Up the Ratio:** The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Using the proportionality, we can write:\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P₁ / P₂) * [(K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) / (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)]³\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   **For System 1:**\n        *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **For System 2:**\n        *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Result:**\n    *   M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    *   M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    *   M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    *   M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\n    *   M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to the option `~ 0.4`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue:** The most important detail is that the systems are eclipsing. This justifies the simplification that the inclination `i` is 90°, allowing for a direct comparison without needing to know the exact inclination angles.\n*   **Total Mass vs. Individual Mass:** The formula used calculates the *sum* of the masses of the two stars (M_total = m₁ + m₂), which is what the question asks for (\"mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars\").\n*   **Units:** Since the calculation is a ratio, the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) cancel out. There is no need to convert them to standard SI units (seconds and meters/s), as long as they are consistent for both systems.\n*   **Cubed Term:** The sum of the velocities is cubed. It is a common mistake to forget this exponent, which would lead to a significantly different and incorrect result.\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information\nA critical piece of information is that both systems are **eclipsing**. For eclipses to be observed, the system's orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n\nWhen `i` ≈ 90°, then `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and consequently `sin³(i)` ≈ 1. This allows for a significant simplification of the mass formula, as the `sin³(i)` term can be ignored.\n\nThe simplified relationship shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### 4. Set Up the Mass Ratio\nTo find the ratio M₁ / M₂, we can use the proportionality:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (P₁ / P₂) * [ (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) / (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) ]³\n\n### 5. Substitute Values and Calculate\nFirst, gather the data and calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = **15 km/s**\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = **25 km/s**\n\nNow, plug these values into the ratio formula. The units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) will cancel out, so no conversion is necessary.\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = **0.432**\n\n### 6.
