Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nWhen we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets, the terms related to the star ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) and the albedo ($A$, which is stated to be the same for both planets) cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The semi-amplitude of the RV curve ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n(The assumption $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ is valid because the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires an edge-on orbit).\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\nThe terms for the gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**6. Combine the Ratios**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to a simplified final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**7. Substitute Values from the Problem**\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, plug these ratios into the final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**8. Final Calculation**\nConvert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option C.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while most agents correctly derived the physics and performed the calculation, many made errors in matching their final numerical result to the correct letter option. The correct calculation consistently yields ~0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Goal Identification\nThe objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### 2. Key Formulas and Derivations\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n    where `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\n*   **Ratio of Temperatures:** To find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(R_star / (2a₁)) / √(R_star / (2a₂)) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-amplitude (K):** The semi-major axis (`a`) can be found using the RV data. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by the transit method (implying inclination `i` ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1), the formula for the star's RV semi-amplitude is:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n*   **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** We can rearrange the RV formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)  =>  a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n    Now, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n*   **Connecting Doppler Shift (Δλ) to RV Amplitude (K):** The RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (K ∝ Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n*   **Final Combined Formula:** Substituting the expressions for the ratios back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]\n    This simplifies to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p₁) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p₂) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53. The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive this numerical result, even though several of them select the wrong final letter. The physics and calculation consistently point to ~0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first derive the correct formula for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures and then use the provided data to calculate the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital semi-major axis ($a$), given that the star's properties (temperature, radius) and the planet's albedo are constant. The formula is $T_{eq} \\propto (1/a)^{1/4}$ is incorrect, the correct relation is $T_{eq} \\propto (1/a)^{1/2}$. Let's re-derive it.\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    For two planets around the same star with the same albedo, the ratio is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_1)} (1-A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_2)} (1-A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$.\n    This confirms the relationship.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit with an inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (a valid assumption for a transiting planet), the formula is $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$.\n\n3.  **Relating Ratios:** From the formula in step 2, we can rearrange to find $\\sqrt{a} \\propto M_p / K$. Therefore, $a \\propto (M_p / K)^2$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{K_2}\\right)^2 / \\left(\\frac{M_{p1}}{K_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$.\n\n4.  **Connecting to Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Thus, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n5.  **Final Formula:** Substituting the results from steps 3 and 4 into the equation from step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** Now, I will use Python to plug in the given values and calculate the final ratio.\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# The derived formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the Doppler shift ratio\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: {temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n\n# Provided options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1.30,\n    \"B\": 0.53,\n    \"C\": 1.05,\n    \"D\": 0.98\n}\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - temp_ratio))\n\nprint(f\"The calculated value {temp_ratio:.4f} is closest to option {closest_option}: ~{options[closest_option]}\")\nprint(f\"The final answer is {closest_option}\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: 0.5357\nThe calculated value 0.5357 is closest to option B: ~0.53\nThe final answer is B\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Identify Key Formulas and Principles**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties (temperature $T_{eff}$ and radius $R_*$), the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$), and its albedo ($A$). The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-amplitude ($K$):** The maximum velocity of the star's wobble caused by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_*$), the semi-major axis ($a$), and the orbital inclination ($i$). For a circular orbit:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n*   **Doppler Shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$):** The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) in the star's spectrum:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Simplify the Temperature Ratio.**\n    We need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Using the formula from above:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data.**\n    We can use the RV formula to find a relationship for the semi-major axis.\n    **Careful Point:** The problem states the planets were detected by *both* transit and RV methods. The transit method only works if the planet's orbit is nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n    The RV formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    Now, we solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$).**\n    Using the expression for $a$ derived above:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n    The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Combine the Formulas.**\n    Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 3.1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root cancels the squares, leading to a very simple final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n*   **Step 3.5: Substitute Doppler Shifts for RV Amplitudes.**\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**4.

Goal Identification\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n*   `R_star` = Star's radius\n*   `A` = Planet's albedo\n*   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2*a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2*a2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nThis assumes the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much less than the star's mass (`M_star`) and that the orbital inclination `i` is ~90° (so `sin(i) ≈ 1`), which is a valid assumption for planets detected by the transit method.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n\n`K^2 ≈ (M_p^2 * G * M_star) / (M_star^2 * a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`. The constants `G` and `M_star` will cancel out:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n### 5. Combining Formulas and Substituting Values\nSubstitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2 )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)`\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7`\n*   Doppler shift ratio: `Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4`\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n### 6.

Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ = Star's effective temperature\n*   $R_*$ = Star's radius\n*   $a$ = Planet's semi-major axis\n*   $A$ = Planet's albedo\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we set up the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ = Planet's mass\n*   $M_*$ = Star's mass\n*   $i$ = Orbital inclination\n*   $G$ = Gravitational constant\n\nA crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using *both* the transit and RV methods. The transit method is only effective when the planet's orbit is nearly edge-on to our line of sight, which means the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nThe simplified formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n### 4. Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nWe need to rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe can now combine the equations from steps 2 and 4:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstituting this into our final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Goal Identification\nThe objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nWhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is its radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we divide T_eq1 by T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same) and have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) information. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis approximation is valid because the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), and the detection via the transit method implies an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nThe RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), so the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`. We can substitute this into our equation for the temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p₁): 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p₂): 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁): 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂): 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe result is clearly closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Core Physics Problem\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$, where $T_{eff}$ is the star's temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $A$ is the albedo.\n\n*   **Simplifying the Ratio:** When taking the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, the terms for the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) cancel out because both planets orbit the same star. The problem also states the albedos are the same ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels. This leaves:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This crucial first step is correctly identified by almost all agents.\n\n*   **Finding the Semi-Major Axis Ratio ($a_2/a_1$):** The semi-major axis ($a$) must be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a circular orbit is given by $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. The assumption $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ is valid because the planets were detected by the transit method.\n    Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n    This derivation is also correctly performed by the majority of the agents.\n\n*   **Final Formula:** Substituting the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n    The final, correct formula is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n### 2. Calculation\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Candidate Answers\n\n*   **Correctness of Calculation:** The overwhelming majority of the agents (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15) correctly derive the physics and arrive at the numerical result of approximately 0.536.\n*   **Correctness of Final Choice:** The calculated value of ~0.536 must be matched with the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 1.05\n    *   B) ~ 0.53\n    *   C) ~ 1.30\n    *   D) ~ 0.98\n    The correct choice is clearly B.\n*   **Analysis of Errors:** Many agents, despite performing the calculation correctly, selected the wrong letter. For example, Answers 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10 all calculate ~0.536 but select \"D\". Answers 7, 11, 14, and 15 also calculate ~0.536 but select \"A\" or \"C\". This appears to be a common error in matching the result to the option list.\n*   **Consensus:** The consensus on the physical derivation and the numerical result is extremely strong. The agents that correctly performed the calculation *and* selected the corresponding option (B) are Answers 2, 6, 8, and 13.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct derivation and calculation across multiple agents, the ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2*a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we divide the equation for Planet1 by the equation for Planet2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁)) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂)) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (`T_eff` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis is the first key relationship: the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's RV curve (`K`) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n*(This assumes the planet's mass `M_p` is much less than the star's mass `M_star`, and the orbital inclination `i` is ~90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The use of the transit method for detection makes this a valid assumption.)*\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`. The terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) will cancel out as they are the same for both systems.\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### 5. Connecting Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K = c * Δλ / λ₀`). Therefore, the ratio of the `K` values is the same as the ratio of the `Δλ` values:\n`K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`\n\n### 6. Deriving the Final Formula\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²`\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )`\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leaving a simple final formula:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\n### 7. Calculation\nPlug in the given values:\n*   `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n*   `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n*   `Δλ₁` = 0.03 Å\n*   `Δλ₂` = 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### 8.

Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe value `0.5357` is closest to `0.53`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**2. Set up the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 ($T_{eq,1}$) and Planet2 ($T_{eq,2}$):\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are the same for both planets, and the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The semi-amplitude of the RV curve ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_p}{M_*}\\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   **Ratio of Masses:**\n    $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes (K):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$).

Goal Identification\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))`\nwhere `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂))]`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nRearranging to solve for `a`:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a) = (G * M_p²) / (a * M_star)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`. The constants `G` and `M_star` will cancel out:\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (K₁² * M_star)]`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### 5. Final Derivation and Calculation\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K ∝ Δλ`). Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²`\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\nFinally, we plug in the given values:\n*   `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n*   `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n*   `Δλ₁ = 0.03` Å\n*   `Δλ₂ = 0.04` Å\n\nThe calculation is:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe derivation is robust and the calculation is straightforward. The final numerical answer is approximately 0.5357, which corresponds to option A. Many of the candidate answers correctly performed the calculation but selected the wrong option letter.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Goal of the Problem\nThe objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWhen we compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, the terms related to the star (T_star, R_star) cancel out because both planets orbit the same star. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo (A), so that term also cancels. The simplified ratio becomes:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis approximation is valid because the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies their orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, making sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for `a` gives:\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Combining Formulas and Calculating the Result\nWe can substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to a very simple final formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K₁ / K₂) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂), since K is directly proportional to Δλ.\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7\n*   Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 5.

The correct approach is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Temperature $T_{star}$, Radius $R_{star}$), the planet's albedo ($A$), and its orbital semi-major axis ($a$). The formula is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$.\n\n    When calculating the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, all terms except the semi-major axis cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n2.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    *(This assumes an orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which is a valid assumption since the planets were detected by the transit method).*\n\n    Rearranging this formula to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. The constant terms ($G$ and $M_{star}$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Combining the Ratios:** Substitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n4.  **Using Doppler Shift Data:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n    This gives the final formula for the temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the underlying physics problem reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method, with discrepancies arising primarily from clerical errors in matching the final calculated value to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal Definition**: The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is `T_eq = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2*a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`. When calculating the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, all terms related to the star (`T_eff`, `R_star`) and the albedo (`A`), which are stated to be the same for both planets, cancel out. This simplifies the expression to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n    This shows the temperature ratio is dependent on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: The semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. The assumption `sin(i) ≈ 1` is justified because the planets were detected via the transit method, which requires an edge-on orbit.\n\n4.  **Rearranging for 'a'**: Solving the RV formula for the semi-major axis `a` gives `a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio `a₂ / a₁`**: By taking the ratio for the two planets, the constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n6.  **Final Formula Derivation**: Substituting the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 2 gives:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]`\n    This simplifies to the final working equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n7.  **Calculation**: The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂`) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`). We can now substitute the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: `M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7`\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n    Plugging these into the final formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n8.  **Numerical Result**: Converting the fraction to a decimal gives `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`. This value is closest to the option `0.53`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides several values that are not needed for the final calculation, such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature, the planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line. These are contextual details that cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **The `sin(i)` Assumption**: The fact that the planets were detected by the transit method is a critical piece of information, as it justifies assuming an orbital inclination `i` of approximately 90°, which makes `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n*   **Derivation Path**: While there are multiple ways to arrange the equations, all correct derivations arrive at the same final relationship: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: A review of the 15 candidate answers shows that the overwhelming majority (at least 12) correctly perform the derivation and calculation, arriving at the value of ~0.536. The frequent selection of incorrect final options (A, B, C) appears to be a simple mistake of matching the correct numerical result to the wrong letter choice, rather than a flaw in the physics reasoning.\n\nBased on the correct and consistent derivation performed by the majority of the agents, the calculated ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, expressed as $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we take the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and having the same albedo ($A$ is constant), all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. This step was correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n    A critical piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**, which implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. This justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n4.  **Derive the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** By rearranging the simplified RV formula to solve for $a$, we get $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. Now, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n    This derivation was also consistently performed correctly by the candidate agents.\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Substitute Data:** Substituting the result from step 4 into the equation from step 2 gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, we can state that $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. This leads to the final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the provided options, it is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem includes several values that are not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii). These are distractors that cancel out when forming the ratio.\n*   **The `sin(i)` Assumption:** The mention of the \"transit method\" is crucial. It allows the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which simplifies the radial velocity formula by making $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Correct Derivation:** The chain of logic—from temperature to semi-major axis, and from semi-major axis to radial velocity—must be followed correctly. The final simplified formula is elegant but relies on several intermediate steps that must be accurate.\n*   **Option Matching:** The candidate answers show that even with a correct calculation, it is possible to select the wrong option letter. A final check is necessary to match the numerical result (~0.536) to the corresponding option (~0.53).\n\nBased on the robust and consistent derivation and calculation across the majority of the agents, the correct numerical answer is approximately 0.536.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Key Formulas and Derivations\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n    where `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\n*   **Ratio of Temperatures:** To find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(R_star / (2a₁)) / √(R_star / (2a₂)) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-amplitude (K):** The semi-major axis (`a`) can be found using the RV data. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by the transit method (implying inclination `i` ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1), the formula for the star's RV semi-amplitude is:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n*   **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** We can rearrange the RV formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)  =>  a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n    Now, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n*   **Connecting Doppler Shift (Δλ) to RV Amplitude (K):** The RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (K ∝ Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n*   **Final Combined Formula:** Substituting the expressions for the ratios back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]\n    This simplifies to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p₁) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p₂) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 4.

The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive this numerical result, even though several of them select the wrong final letter. The physics and calculation consistently point to ~0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first derive the correct formula for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures and then use the provided data to calculate the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital semi-major axis ($a$), given that the star's properties (temperature, radius) and the planet's albedo are constant. The formula is $T_{eq} \\propto (1/a)^{1/4}$ is incorrect, the correct relation is $T_{eq} \\propto (1/a)^{1/2}$. Let's re-derive it.\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    For two planets around the same star with the same albedo, the ratio is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_1)} (1-A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_2)} (1-A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$.\n    This confirms the relationship.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit with an inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (a valid assumption for a transiting planet), the formula is $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$.\n\n3.  **Relating Ratios:** From the formula in step 2, we can rearrange to find $\\sqrt{a} \\propto M_p / K$. Therefore, $a \\propto (M_p / K)^2$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{K_2}\\right)^2 / \\left(\\frac{M_{p1}}{K_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$.\n\n4.  **Connecting to Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Thus, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n5.  **Final Formula:** Substituting the results from steps 3 and 4 into the equation from step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** Now, I will use Python to plug in the given values and calculate the final ratio.\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# The derived formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the Doppler shift ratio\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: {temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n\n# Provided options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1.30,\n    \"B\": 0.53,\n    \"C\": 1.05,\n    \"D\": 0.98\n}\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - temp_ratio))\n\nprint(f\"The calculated value {temp_ratio:.4f} is closest to option {closest_option}: ~{options[closest_option]}\")\nprint(f\"The final answer is {closest_option}\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: 0.5357\nThe calculated value 0.5357 is closest to option B: ~0.53\nThe final answer is B\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Identify Key Formulas and Principles**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties (temperature $T_{eff}$ and radius $R_*$), the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$), and its albedo ($A$). The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-amplitude ($K$):** The maximum velocity of the star's wobble caused by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_*$), the semi-major axis ($a$), and the orbital inclination ($i$). For a circular orbit:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n*   **Doppler Shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$):** The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) in the star's spectrum:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Simplify the Temperature Ratio.**\n    We need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Using the formula from above:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data.**\n    We can use the RV formula to find a relationship for the semi-major axis.\n    **Careful Point:** The problem states the planets were detected by *both* transit and RV methods. The transit method only works if the planet's orbit is nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n    The RV formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    Now, we solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$).**\n    Using the expression for $a$ derived above:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n    The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Combine the Formulas.**\n    Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 3.1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root cancels the squares, leading to a very simple final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n*   **Step 3.5: Substitute Doppler Shifts for RV Amplitudes.**\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**4.

Goal Identification\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n*   `R_star` = Star's radius\n*   `A` = Planet's albedo\n*   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2*a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2*a2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nThis assumes the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much less than the star's mass (`M_star`) and that the orbital inclination `i` is ~90° (so `sin(i) ≈ 1`), which is a valid assumption for planets detected by the transit method.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n\n`K^2 ≈ (M_p^2 * G * M_star) / (M_star^2 * a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`. The constants `G` and `M_star` will cancel out:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n### 5. Combining Formulas and Substituting Values\nSubstitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2 )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)`\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7`\n*   Doppler shift ratio: `Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4`\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n### 6.

Goal Identification\nThe objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nWhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is its radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we divide T_eq1 by T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same) and have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) information. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis approximation is valid because the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), and the detection via the transit method implies an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nThe RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), so the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`. We can substitute this into our equation for the temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p₁): 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p₂): 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁): 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂): 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 0.53.

Analysis of the Core Physics Problem\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$, where $T_{eff}$ is the star's temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $A$ is the albedo.\n\n*   **Simplifying the Ratio:** When taking the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, the terms for the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) cancel out because both planets orbit the same star. The problem also states the albedos are the same ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels. This leaves:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This crucial first step is correctly identified by almost all agents.\n\n*   **Finding the Semi-Major Axis Ratio ($a_2/a_1$):** The semi-major axis ($a$) must be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a circular orbit is given by $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. The assumption $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ is valid because the planets were detected by the transit method.\n    Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n    This derivation is also correctly performed by the majority of the agents.\n\n*   **Final Formula:** Substituting the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n    The final, correct formula is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n### 2. Calculation\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Candidate Answers\n\n*   **Correctness of Calculation:** The overwhelming majority of the agents (Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15) correctly derive the physics and arrive at the numerical result of approximately 0.536.\n*   **Correctness of Final Choice:** The calculated value of ~0.536 must be matched with the given options:\n    *   A) ~ 1.05\n    *   B) ~ 0.53\n    *   C) ~ 1.30\n    *   D) ~ 0.98\n    The correct choice is clearly B.\n*   **Analysis of Errors:** Many agents, despite performing the calculation correctly, selected the wrong letter. For example, Answers 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10 all calculate ~0.536 but select \"D\". Answers 7, 11, 14, and 15 also calculate ~0.536 but select \"A\" or \"C\". This appears to be a common error in matching the result to the option list.\n*   **Consensus:** The consensus on the physical derivation and the numerical result is extremely strong. The agents that correctly performed the calculation *and* selected the corresponding option (B) are Answers 2, 6, 8, and 13.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct derivation and calculation across multiple agents, the ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2*a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we divide the equation for Planet1 by the equation for Planet2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁)) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂)) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (`T_eff` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis is the first key relationship: the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's RV curve (`K`) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n*(This assumes the planet's mass `M_p` is much less than the star's mass `M_star`, and the orbital inclination `i` is ~90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The use of the transit method for detection makes this a valid assumption.)*\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`. The terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) will cancel out as they are the same for both systems.\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### 5. Connecting Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K = c * Δλ / λ₀`). Therefore, the ratio of the `K` values is the same as the ratio of the `Δλ` values:\n`K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`\n\n### 6. Deriving the Final Formula\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²`\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )`\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leaving a simple final formula:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\n### 7. Calculation\nPlug in the given values:\n*   `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n*   `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n*   `Δλ₁` = 0.03 Å\n*   `Δλ₂` = 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### 8. Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe value `0.5357` is closest to `0.53`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**2. Set up the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 ($T_{eq,1}$) and Planet2 ($T_{eq,2}$):\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are the same for both planets, and the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The semi-amplitude of the RV curve ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_p}{M_*}\\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   **Ratio of Masses:**\n    $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes (K):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$).

Goal Identification\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))`\nwhere `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂))]`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2*a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2*a₂))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nRearranging to solve for `a`:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a) = (G * M_p²) / (a * M_star)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`. The constants `G` and `M_star` will cancel out:\n`a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (K₁² * M_star)]`\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### 5. Final Derivation and Calculation\nThe RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K ∝ Δλ`). Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²`\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\nFinally, we plug in the given values:\n*   `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n*   `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n*   `Δλ₁ = 0.03` Å\n*   `Δλ₂ = 0.04` Å\n\nThe calculation is:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe derivation is robust and the calculation is straightforward.

The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo (A), so that term also cancels. The simplified ratio becomes:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis approximation is valid because the planets were detected by the transit method, which implies their orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, making sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for `a` gives:\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Combining Formulas and Calculating the Result\nWe can substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]\n\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to a very simple final formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K₁ / K₂) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂), since K is directly proportional to Δλ.\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7\n*   Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 5.

When calculating the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, all terms related to the star (`T_eff`, `R_star`) and the albedo (`A`), which are stated to be the same for both planets, cancel out. This simplifies the expression to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n    This shows the temperature ratio is dependent on the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: The semi-major axis (`a`) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) for a planet in a circular orbit is `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. The assumption `sin(i) ≈ 1` is justified because the planets were detected via the transit method, which requires an edge-on orbit.\n\n4.  **Rearranging for 'a'**: Solving the RV formula for the semi-major axis `a` gives `a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio `a₂ / a₁`**: By taking the ratio for the two planets, the constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n6.  **Final Formula Derivation**: Substituting the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 2 gives:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]`\n    This simplifies to the final working equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n7.  **Calculation**: The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂`) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`). We can now substitute the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: `M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7`\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n    Plugging these into the final formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n8.  **Numerical Result**: Converting the fraction to a decimal gives `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`. This value is closest to the option `0.53`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides several values that are not needed for the final calculation, such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature, the planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line. These are contextual details that cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **The `sin(i)` Assumption**: The fact that the planets were detected by the transit method is a critical piece of information, as it justifies assuming an orbital inclination `i` of approximately 90°, which makes `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n*   **Derivation Path**: While there are multiple ways to arrange the equations, all correct derivations arrive at the same final relationship: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: A review of the 15 candidate answers shows that the overwhelming majority (at least 12) correctly perform the derivation and calculation, arriving at the value of ~0.536. The frequent selection of incorrect final options (A, B, C) appears to be a simple mistake of matching the correct numerical result to the wrong letter choice, rather than a flaw in the physics reasoning.\n\nBased on the correct and consistent derivation performed by the majority of the agents, the calculated ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
