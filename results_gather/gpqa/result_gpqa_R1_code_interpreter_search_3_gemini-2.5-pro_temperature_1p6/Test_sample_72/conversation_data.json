    "This problem requires us to calculate two quantities for a system of two astronauts: their relative speed and the total energy of the system. We are dealing with speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe are given the velocities of the two astronauts in the same reference frame (let's say, a stationary observer's frame):\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nBoth are moving in the positive x-direction.\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity addition (or in this case, subtraction to find the relative velocity) is:\n$v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\nwhere $v_{21}$ is the velocity of astronaut 2 as measured by astronaut 1.\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n$v_{21} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{21} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{21} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{21} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{21} \\approx -0.142857c$\n\nThe question asks for the relative speed, which is the magnitude of this velocity.\n$v_{rel} = |v_{21}| \\approx 0.142857c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} = 0.14c$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the equation:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere:\n*   $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, calculated as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) \\times c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n$E_{total} = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2$\n$E_{total} = 5.9641 mc^2$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $E = 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy, $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the lab frame be $S$. Astronaut 1's frame is $S'$ and Astronaut 2's frame is $S''$. We want to find the velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2 = 0.5c$) as observed by astronaut 1 ($v_1 = 0.6c$).\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity ($v_{21}$) of object 2 with respect to object 1 is:\n$v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$ (velocity of astronaut 1)\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$ (velocity of astronaut 2)\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n$v_{21} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{21} \\approx -0.142857c$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that astronaut 2 is moving in the negative direction from astronaut 1's perspective. The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) is the magnitude of this velocity.\n\n$v_{rel} = |v_{21}| \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} = 0.14c$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy ($E$) of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at speed $v$ is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding the total energy to two decimal places gives $E_{total} = 5.96 mc^2$.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the numerical calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1 # We can work in units where c=1 and reintroduce it later.\nm = 1 # We can work in units where m=1 and reintroduce it later.\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Relative Speed Calculation ---\n# v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2)\nv_rel_numerator = v2 - v1\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\nv_rel_val = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# Speed is the magnitude\nrelative_speed = abs(v_rel_val)\n\n# --- Total Energy Calculation ---\n# E = gamma * m * c^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n# Energy of Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * (c**2)\n\n# Energy of Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * (c**2)\n\n# Total Energy\ntotal_energy = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {relative_speed:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy: {total_energy:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n\nComparing our calculated values:\n*   Relative Speed: $v_{rel} = 0.14c$\n*   Total Energy: $E = 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
