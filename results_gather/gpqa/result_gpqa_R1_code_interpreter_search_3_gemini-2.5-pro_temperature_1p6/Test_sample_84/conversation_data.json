    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of an exoplanet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to compute the ratio for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms in the ratio are common to both planets and will cancel out:\n    *   The star's properties ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) are the same for both planets.\n    *   The problem states that we should assume the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$).\n    *   The factor of 2 also cancels.\n\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This means the problem has now been reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n5.  **Relate Observational Data to Semi-Major Axis:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) caused by each planet. I need to connect this to the semi-major axis ($a$).\n\n    *   First, the maximum Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K_{star}$) by the Doppler formula:\n        $K_{star} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n        where $c$ is the speed of light. Since $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constants, we have $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n    *   Next, the radial velocity amplitude ($K_{star}$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n        $K_{star} = v_{star,orb} \\sin i = \\left(\\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}}\\right) v_{planet,orb} \\sin i$\n        Where $M_{planet}$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $v_{planet,orb}$ is the planet's orbital velocity, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n    *   For a circular orbit, the planet's orbital velocity is $v_{planet,orb} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star} + M_{planet})}{a}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$ (since planet mass is much smaller than star mass).\n\n    *   Combining these, we get:\n        $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n6.  **Incorporate a Key Assumption:** The problem states the planets were also detected by the *transit* method. A transit can only occur if the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle $i$ is very close to 90°. For $i \\approx 90°$, we can assume $\\sin i \\approx 1$. Since both planets transit, we can make this assumption for both of them.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis ($a$):**\n    With $\\sin i = 1$, the formula becomes:\n    $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_{planet}}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n    Squaring both sides and rearranging to solve for $a$:\n    $K_{star}^2 = \\frac{M_{planet}^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_{planet}^2}{M_{star} K_{star}^2}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):** Now I can compute the ratio using the formula for $a$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{ \\frac{G M_2^2}{M_{star} K_2^2} }{ \\frac{G M_1^2}{M_{star} K_1^2} }$\n\n    The constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    *   Mass Ratio: $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$, $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$. So, $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude Ratio: Since $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, the ratio of amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n10. **Perform the Final Calculation:** I will substitute these ratios back into the equations. A simple Python script is efficient for this arithmetic.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given planet mass equivalents and Doppler shifts\nM1 = 7  # in Earth masses\nM2 = 5  # in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n# The ratio of semi-major axes is a2 / a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes is K1 / K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the square of the mass ratio (M2/M1)^2\nmass_ratio_sq = (M2 / M1)**2\n\n# Calculate the square of the K-ratio (K1/K2)^2\nk_ratio_sq = (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1\na_ratio_2_1 = mass_ratio_sq * k_ratio_sq\n\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures\ntemp_ratio_1_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_1)\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio_1_2:.4f}\")\n```\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: 0.5357\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.536.

    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we first need to understand the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$).\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets possess the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ terms also cancel. The factor of 2 cancels as well. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets' orbits.\n\nWe can relate the semi-major axis to the observables from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV amplitude ($K_{star}$) is related to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) by:\n$K_{star} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe RV amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n(Assuming the planet's mass $M_{planet}$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$). Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nThe problem states that both planets were detected using the transit method, which implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. Therefore, we can assume the inclination angle $i \\approx 90°$, which means $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nNow we can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K_{star}^2 = \\frac{M_{planet}^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_{planet}^2}{M_{star} K_{star}^2}$\n\nNow we can compute the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n\nThe constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K_1 / K_2$) is the same as the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nFinally, we substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow we can plug in the values from the problem:\n*   $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the final value:\n```python\nM1 = 7  # Earth masses\nM2 = 5  # Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# Temperature ratio is (M2/M1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemp_ratio = (M2 / M1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n0.5357142857142857\n\nThe ratio is approximately 0.536.

Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
