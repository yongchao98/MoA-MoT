    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration. The structure is `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, so it remains (S).\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from either face, creating both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 stereocenter.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   These two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is opposite (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`. This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`. Since there are two new chiral centers (C2 and C4), we must consider all possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material with achiral reagents, this pair is formed as a 50:50 racemic mixture.\n        *   The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) structures are superimposable on their mirror images due to an internal plane of symmetry. They are the same achiral molecule, known as a **meso compound**.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC uses a polar stationary phase and a non-polar mobile phase to separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Separation Principles:**\n    *   It separates constitutional isomers (molecules with different connectivity).\n    *   It separates diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n    *   It **does not** separate enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images), which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Applying to the product mixture:**\n    1.  The products of Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The products of Reaction II consist of a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of each other. They will be separated. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute (elute together) as a single peak. Thus, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    3.  The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (diols). They have different molecular formulas, functional groups, and polarities, and will therefore be well separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Adding the peaks from each group gives a total of 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). This allows for the separation of all non-identical molecules, including enantiomers. The principle is that enantiomers form transient diastereomeric complexes with the CSP, and these complexes have different stabilities, leading to different retention times.\n*   **Applying to the product mixture:**\n    *   A chiral column will separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers just like a normal-phase column.\n    *   Crucially, it will also separate the enantiomers produced in Reaction II.\n*   **Counting the peaks:** We simply count the total number of unique stereoisomers in the combined final mixture.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol -> **1 peak** (diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (achiral, but different from others)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (enantiomer of 4, now separable)\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of unique molecules is 5. Therefore, we will observe **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Its structure has a chiral center at carbon C5 with an (S) configuration. The ketone is at C3.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`\n    *   The chiral center at C5 is `CH(OCH3)`.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n\n3.  **Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter.\n    *   The hydride (`H-`) can attack the carbonyl from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration.\n    *   Since the reduction creates a new stereocenter (at C3) in a molecule that already has one (at C5), the two possible products are diastereomers.\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   Therefore, **Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomers.**\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n    *   This molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), which will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n3.  **Products and Stereochemistry:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers for pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n4.  **Analysis of the stereoisomers:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They are **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor with achiral reagents, this pair is formed as a 50:50 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry. It is a **meso compound** and is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (flipping it over reveals they are the same molecule).\n    *   Therefore, **Reaction II produces three stereoisomers:** the meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions:\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nThere are a total of **five** distinct chemical compounds in the mixture.\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC Analysis:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   It can separate **constitutional isomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers** because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are **diastereomers**. They have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three products from Reaction II are the meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers, so it will separate from them. This gives **1 peak** for the meso compound. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers will co-elute (travel together) and produce only **1 peak**. So, the products from Reaction II give a total of **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas, functional groups, and polarities. Therefore, the set of peaks from Reaction I will be well-separated from the set of peaks from Reaction II.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC Analysis:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, **including enantiomers**.\n*   It works by forming temporary diastereomeric complexes between the analytes and the chiral stationary phase, which have different energies and stabilities, leading to different elution times.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column will resolve every unique stereoisomer present in the mixture.\n*   Let's count the unique molecules:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two separate chemical reactions and then an understanding of how different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) separate the resulting mixture of molecules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that contains a single pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar ketone group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction and retains its (S) configuration.\n    *   Attack from one face gives the (3R, 5S)-alcohol.\n    *   Attack from the other face gives the (3S, 5S)-alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The two products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are stereoisomers. Since they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** This reaction produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4. We must consider all possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and achiral reagents, this pair is formed as a 50:50 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the (2R, 4S) structure possesses an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is called a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) structure is identical to and superimposable on the (2R, 4S) structure.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** This reaction produces a mixture of **three stereoisomeric products**: one meso compound and one racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total product mixture contains five unique molecules:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**A) Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will have different physical properties and will separate, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will separate from them, giving **1 peak**. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not separate from each other and will elute together as a single peak, giving **1 peak**. Thus, the products of Reaction II give a total of **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**B) Analysis with Chiral HPLC**\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between and separate all stereoisomers, **including enantiomers**. It will resolve every unique molecule in the mixture into a separate peak.\n\n*   We simply count the number of unique stereoisomers in the combined mixture.\n*   As determined above, there are five distinct stereoisomeric products in total.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "This is a problem that involves analyzing the stereochemical outcomes of two organic reactions and then predicting their separation behavior using two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **The Reactant:** The starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

This reduction creates a new chiral center at carbon 3.\n3.  **The Products:** The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The new chiral center at C3 can form in either the (R) or (S) configuration because the hydride attack on the planar ketone can occur from either face.

Chiral HPLC Analysis**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with the enantiomers of a chiral molecule, enabling their separation. It separates all non-identical molecules, including constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   Since chiral HPLC can resolve every unique stereoisomer, we will see one peak for each of the five distinct molecules produced.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will produce:\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
