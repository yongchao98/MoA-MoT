    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Constituents\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus \"X\" as Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z = 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   It is also stated that the nucleus has 3 neutrons (N = 3).\n*   The mass number A is the total number of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^6_3$Li).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Mass and Rest Energy ($E_0$)\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $E_0 = m_0 c^2$ is the rest energy. There are two common ways to determine the rest mass ($m_0$) of a nucleus:\n\n*   **Method A (Physically Accurate):** Use the actual measured mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus, which accounts for nuclear binding energy.\n*   **Method B (Simplified Approximation):** Calculate the mass by summing the masses of its individual constituents (3 protons and 3 neutrons). This method ignores the binding energy that holds the nucleus together.\n\nIn physics problems, especially multiple-choice questions, it's common to use the simplified approach. Let's calculate the rest energy using Method B and see if it matches one of the options.\n\nFirst, we need the standard values for the rest energies of a proton and a neutron.\n*   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$): 938.272 MeV\n*   Rest energy of a neutron ($m_n c^2$): 939.565 MeV\n\nThe rest energy ($E_0$) of the composite nucleus is approximated as:\n$E_0 = (3 \\times m_p c^2) + (3 \\times m_n c^2)$\n$E_0 = (3 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV}) + (3 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV})$\n$E_0 = 2814.816 \\text{ MeV} + 2818.695 \\text{ MeV}$\n$E_0 = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\nThe Lorentz factor depends on the speed of the particle, $v$. The problem states $v = 0.96c$.\nThe formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\nSubstitute $v = 0.96c$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total energy E is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n$E = \\gamma E_0$\n$E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n$E \\approx 20119.68 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 5. Convert the Energy to GeV and Compare\nThe result is in Mega-electron Volts (MeV). To convert it to Giga-electron Volts (GeV), we divide by 1000.\n$E \\approx \\frac{20119.68}{1000} \\text{ GeV}$\n$E \\approx 20.120 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow, we compare this result to the given options:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 21.419\n\nOur calculated value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option B) 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to the use of slightly different rounding for the physical constants (mass of proton and neutron) in the problem's design.\n\nFor completeness, if we had used the physically accurate mass of a $^6$Li nucleus (which has a rest energy of about 5601.4 MeV), the total energy would be approximately 20.005 GeV, which does not match any of the options. This confirms that the intended method was the simplified one.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with high precision, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants based on sum of constituent masses (in MeV)\nmass_proton_mev = 938.272088\nmass_neutron_mev = 939.56542\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the rest energy (E0) in MeV from constituent masses\nrest_energy_mev = (num_protons * mass_proton_mev) + (num_neutrons * mass_neutron_mev)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total relativistic energy (E) in MeV\ntotal_energy_mev = gamma * rest_energy_mev\n\n# Step 4: Convert the total energy to GeV\ntotal_energy_gev = total_energy_mev / 1000\n\nprint(f\"Calculated Rest Energy (E0): {rest_energy_mev:.4f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Lorentz Factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Total Energy (E): {total_energy_gev:.4f} GeV\")\n```\n>>>\nCalculated Rest Energy (E0): 5633.5125 MeV\nLorentz Factor (gamma): 3.5714\nCalculated Total Energy (E): 20.1197 GeV\nThe precise calculation gives 20.1197 GeV, which reinforces that option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
