    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction using the provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The starting material X is C₁₁H₁₂O. The reaction appears to be a rearrangement, so the product should have the same formula. Let's verify this with the NMR data.\n    *   IHD (Index of Hydrogen Deficiency) for C₁₁H₁₂O = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 6. This suggests a benzene ring (IHD=4) and two additional degrees of unsaturation (e.g., two double bonds, or a double bond and a ring).\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 197.7 ppm: This is a characteristic chemical shift for a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone or an aldehyde. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm: There are several signals in this range, typical for aromatic and vinylic (C=C) carbons. The presence of a C=O and carbons in this region confirms a conjugated system. This accounts for the benzene ring (IHD=4) and a C=C double bond (IHD=1), satisfying the total IHD of 6.\n    *   δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm: These are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two carbon atoms, likely from methyl groups given the ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons. One is likely an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O), and the other is likely attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The signals from δ 6.75 to 7.71 represent 6 protons in the aromatic/vinylic region. Let's break them down:\n        *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): These two doublets, each for 1 proton, indicate two vinylic protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-) that are coupled to each other. The large difference in their chemical shifts suggests they are part of a conjugated system (an enone).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a ketone group (-C=O).\n    2.  We have an acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O), which explains the singlet at δ ~2.3 ppm and the C=O group.\n    3.  We have a para-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is a methyl group, explaining the other CH₃ singlet at δ ~2.3 ppm. This gives us a p-tolyl group (H₃C-C₆H₄-).\n    4.  We have a trans-disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    5.  Putting these pieces together, the only logical structure is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one (also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n\n    *Structure:*\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n    CH₃-C-CH=CH-┌─────┐\n                │     │-CH₃\n                └─────┘\n    ```\n    *Let's check if this structure (C₁₁H₁₂O) matches the NMR data perfectly:*\n    *   **¹H-NMR:**\n        *   CH₃-C=O: singlet (δ 2.28).\n        *   Ar-CH₃: singlet (δ 2.31).\n        *   Proton α to C=O (-CO-CH=): doublet (δ 6.75).\n        *   Aromatic protons meta to the vinyl group: doublet for 2H (δ 7.08).\n        *   Proton β to C=O (-CH=CH-Ar): doublet (δ 7.68).\n        *   Aromatic protons ortho to the vinyl group: doublet for 2H (δ 7.71).\n        This assignment is fully consistent with the data.\n\n    *   **¹³C-NMR:** The count of different types of carbons (2 methyl, 1 ketone, 4 aromatic CH, 2 vinylic CH, 2 quaternary aromatic C) also matches the signal count and general chemical shift regions.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The transformation of Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) into 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one is an isomerization. The conditions (high temperature, nonpolar solvent) are characteristic of a thermal rearrangement. The reagent DABCO is a non-nucleophilic base, suggesting the reaction is not acid-catalyzed.\n\n*   **The Mechanism:** The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. A known thermal reaction that produces such compounds is the rearrangement of a vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a double bond). The general transformation is:\n    `R-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂ → R-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`\n    (A terminal vinyloxirane rearranges to a methyl ketone).\n    This reaction often proceeds via a diradical intermediate formed by the homolytic cleavage of the allylic C-O bond of the epoxide ring.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options for Compound X:**\n    We are looking for a C₁₁H₁₂O vinyloxirane that would rearrange to our identified product, 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Here, the 'R' group is the p-tolyl group.\n\n    *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n        *   Structure: p-Tolyl-CH=CH-CH-CH₂-O (with an epoxide ring on the last two carbons).\n        *   This structure fits the general form `R-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` where R = p-tolyl.\n        *   According to the rearrangement mechanism, this compound would yield `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`, which is exactly our product.\n        *   Molecular formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. This is a perfect match.\n\n    *   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:**\n        *   Structure: Phenyl-CH=CH-CH-CH₂-O (epoxide).\n        *   Molecular Formula: C₁₀H₁₀O. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:**\n        *   Structure: Phenyl-CH=CH-CH-CH(CH₃)-O (epoxide).\n        *   Molecular Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n        *   This would rearrange to a different ketone (3-phenylpent-4-en-2-one). Also, the starting material has a phenyl group, but the product has a p-tolyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:**\n        *   Structure: Phenyl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH-CH₂-O (epoxide).\n        *   Molecular Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n        *   This would rearrange to 3-methyl-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, which is not the observed product. It also starts with a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the product is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This product is formed via the thermal rearrangement of a specific vinyloxirane. Only compound **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** has the correct structure and molecular formula to be the precursor (Compound X).\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a multistep problem that involves first identifying the product of a reaction from its spectroscopic data, and then deducing the starting material (Compound X).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Product from the NMR Data**\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 197.7: This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in a ketone or an aldehyde.\n    *   δ 126.9 - 144.1: This range contains six signals and is typical for sp² carbons found in aromatic rings and alkenes. The intensity information (2C for two signals) suggests symmetry.\n    *   δ 21.3 and 28.4: These are sp³ carbons, likely from methyl groups.\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for C₁₁H₁₂O is (2*11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 6. This is consistent with a benzene ring (IHD=4), a double bond (IHD=1), and a carbonyl group (IHD=1).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s): These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons, indicating two methyl (CH₃) groups with no adjacent protons. One is likely a methyl ketone (CH₃-C=O) and the other is a methyl group on a benzene ring (Ar-CH₃).\n    *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d): This A₂B₂ splitting pattern is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d): These are two doublets, each for one proton. They are coupled to each other and are in the vinyl region, indicating a -CH=CH- group. The significant downfield shift suggests conjugation with both the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product:**\n    1.  We have a methyl ketone group: `CH₃-C=O`\n    2.  We have a para-methyl substituted benzene ring (a *p*-tolyl group).\n    3.  These two fragments are connected by a `-CH=CH-` linker.\n\n    Putting it all together, the product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n    CH₃-C-CH=CH- (p-tolyl ring)\n    ```\n    This structure matches the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O and is fully consistent with all NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Compound X**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction involves heating an epoxide (as implied by the options) in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base (DABCO), resulting in a rearrangement. This specific transformation, from a vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is a known thermal or base-catalyzed rearrangement.\n    `R-CH=CH-CH-CH₂(epoxide)  --Δ--> R-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`\n\n*   **Deducing Compound X:** We need to find the vinyloxirane precursor that would rearrange to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. In our case, the R group is the 4-methylphenyl (p-tolyl) group. The precursor should therefore be:\n    `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH-CH₂(epoxide)`\n    This corresponds to the chemical name 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This matches our deduced precursor structure and has the correct molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O. This is the correct answer.\n    *   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** The `styryl` group implies a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. The formula is C₁₀H₁₀O. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This has a styryl (phenyl) group, not a p-tolyl group. The methyl on the epoxide ring would also lead to a different product. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This also starts with a phenyl group and has a different substitution pattern on the double bond, which would lead to a different product.

    "This problem requires a two-step process: first, deduce the structure of the reaction product from the provided NMR spectra, and second, identify which of the potential starting materials (Compound X) would yield this product under the given reaction conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Product from NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and IHD:** The starting material is C₁₁H₁₂O. Assuming the reaction is a rearrangement, the product has the same formula. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: IHD = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This high IHD suggests the presence of a benzene ring (IHD=4) and two additional units of unsaturation (e.g., a C=C bond and a C=O bond).\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 ppm (1C, s):** This is a characteristic chemical shift for a carbonyl carbon (C=O), confirming the presence of a ketone or aldehyde.

The presence of two signals that each account for two carbons (`126.9 (2C)` and `129.1 (2C)`) is strong evidence for a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, specifically a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring. The signals in this region account for the benzene ring (IHD=4) and one C=C double bond (IHD=1).\n    *   **δ 21.3 ppm (1C, s) and 28.4 ppm (1C, s):** These two signals are in the aliphatic sp³ region and correspond to two carbon atoms, likely methyl groups.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** The presence of two sharp singlets, each integrating to three protons, confirms two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons. One is likely an acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O), consistent with the ketone identified in the ¹³C spectrum.

The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates a highly conjugated system, specifically an enone (an alkene conjugated with a ketone).\n\n*   **Structure of the Product:**\n    Putting all the pieces together:\n    1.  A methyl ketone group (CH₃-C=O).\n    2.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with a methyl group as one substituent (a p-tolyl group).\n    3.  A trans double bond linking the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring.\n\n    This leads to the structure of **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.

This accounts for one of the six degrees of unsaturation calculated from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O (IHD = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 6).\n    *   **δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm:** This is the aromatic/alkene region. There are six unique carbon environments here, but the intensities `(2C)` for two signals (δ 126.9 and 129.1) indicate that they each represent two equivalent carbons. This symmetry is a strong indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for four degrees of unsaturation. The remaining two sp² carbons must belong to a C=C double bond, which accounts for the final degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 21.3 ppm and 28.4 ppm:** These signals are in the aliphatic (sp³) region and are consistent with two different methyl carbons.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s):** These two singlets, each integrating to three protons, confirm the presence of two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not coupled to any neighboring protons.

This is an isomerization reaction. The conditions (high temperature, non-nucleophilic base DABCO) are characteristic of a thermal rearrangement.\n*   **The Precursor:** The formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone from an isomer often points to the rearrangement of a vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a double bond). The general transformation that yields a methyl ketone is:\n    R-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂ → R-CH=CH-CO-CH₃\n*   **Applying to our case:** Our product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.

In this case, the `R` group is the 4-methylphenyl (p-tolyl) group.\n    *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This compound's structure is `(4-methylphenyl)-CH=CH-CH-CH₂(epoxide)`. It perfectly matches the required precursor structure. Its formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. Rearrangement gives the correct product.\n    *   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** A \"styryl\" group has a simple phenyl ring (C₆H₅-), not the p-tolyl ring found in the product. The formula (C₁₀H₁₀O) is also incorrect.\n    *   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This also contains a simple phenyl ring, and the methyl group on the epoxide ring would lead to a different ketone product.\n    *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This has a simple phenyl ring and a different substitution pattern on the alkene, which would lead to a different product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material that can rearrange to form this product under the given conditions is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<A>>>"
