    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Energy Components**\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of this system of 13 point charges is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can break this down into two main parts:\n*   **`U_center_sphere`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (`q_c`) and the 12 charges on the sphere (`q_s`).\n*   **`U_sphere_sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual interaction among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe total energy is `U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Energy Equations**\n\nLet `q` be the charge of each identical particle, so `q = 2e`.\nLet `k` be Coulomb's constant (`8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2`).\nLet `R` be the radius of the sphere (`2 m`).\n\n*   **`U_center_sphere`**:\n    There are 12 pairs, each consisting of the central charge and one charge on the sphere. The distance for each pair is fixed at `R = 2 m`.\n    `U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q * q / R) = 12 * k * q^2 / R`\n\n*   **`U_sphere_sphere`**:\n    This is the sum of potential energies for all pairs of charges on the sphere's surface. There are `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` such pairs.\n    `U_sphere_sphere = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`, where `r_ij` is the distance between charge `i` and charge `j`.\n\n**3. Determine the Minimum Energy Configuration**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum energy of the system. The `U_center_sphere` term is constant because `R` is fixed. Therefore, to minimize `U_total`, we must minimize `U_sphere_sphere`. This is a classic problem known as the **Thomson problem**. For 12 identical charges on the surface of a sphere, the configuration that minimizes their mutual repulsion energy is a **regular icosahedron**, where the charges are located at the vertices.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for the Icosahedron Configuration**\n\nWe can factor out the constant terms from `U_sphere_sphere`:\n`U_sphere_sphere = k * q^2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (1 / r_ij)`\n\nIt is convenient to express this sum in a dimensionless form by factoring out `1/R`:\n`U_sphere_sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (R / r_ij)`\n\nLet's define `S_12 = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (R / r_ij)`. This `S_12` is a purely geometric constant for an icosahedron.\n\nTo calculate `S_12`, we need the distances between the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R`. There are three distinct distances between pairs of vertices:\n1.  **Edge length (`a`)**: There are 30 edges in an icosahedron. The relation to the circumradius `R` is `a = 4R / sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5))`.\n2.  **Face diagonal (`b`)**: This is the distance between two vertices that are not adjacent but not antipodal. For an icosahedron, this distance is `b = a * φ`, where `φ` is the golden ratio `(1 + sqrt(5))/2`. There are 30 such pairs.\n3.  **Diameter (`c`)**: This is the distance to the opposite (antipodal) vertex. `c = 2R`. There are `12 / 2 = 6` such pairs.\n\nThe sum `S_12` is therefore:\n`S_12 = 30 * (R/a) + 30 * (R/b) + 6 * (R/c)`\n`S_12 = 30 * (R/a) + 30 * (R/(a*φ)) + 6 * (R/(2R))`\n`S_12 = 30 * (R/a) * (1 + 1/φ) + 3`\nUsing the identity `1 + 1/φ = φ`:\n`S_12 = 30 * φ * (R/a) + 3`\nSubstituting `R/a = sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) / 4`:\n`S_12 = 30 * φ * (sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) / 4) + 3 = 7.5 * φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3`\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy**\n\nNow we can write the total energy as:\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (k * q^2 / R) * S_12`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + S_12)`\n\nSubstituting `q = 2e`, we get:\n`U_total = (k * (2e)^2 / R) * (12 + S_12) = (4 * k * e^2 / R) * (12 + S_12)`\n\nWe will now use Python to compute the numerical value of `S_12` and then `U_total`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Physical and Mathematical Constants ---\n# Coulomb's constant in N m^2 / C^2\nk = 8.9875517923e9\n# Elementary charge in C\ne = 1.602176634e-19\n# Golden ratio\nphi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n\n# --- Problem Parameters ---\n# Radius of the sphere in meters\nR = 2.0\n# Charge of each particle\nq = 2 * e\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the System and Identify Energy Components**\n\nThe system consists of 13 point charges.\n*   One central charge, let's call it `q_c`, is fixed at a point P.\n*   Twelve other charges, `q_1, q_2, ..., q_{12}`, are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n*   All 13 charges are identical, with charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`1.602 x 10^-19 C`).\n*   The system is isolated, so we only need to consider the electrostatic potential energy.\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of this system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can split this sum into two parts:\n*   **`U_center-sphere`**: The interaction energy between the central charge `q_c` and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n*   **`U_sphere-sphere`**: The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere's surface.\n\nThe total energy is the sum: `U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Energy for Each Component**\n\nWe use Coulomb's law for potential energy between two point charges `q_a` and `q_b` separated by a distance `r`: `U = k * q_a * q_b / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2`).\n\n*   **`U_center-sphere`**:\n    The central charge `q_c = q = 2e` interacts with each of the 12 sphere charges `q_s = q = 2e`. The distance is always the radius `R = 2 m`. There are 12 such pairs.\n    `U_center-sphere = 12 * (k * q_c * q_s / R) = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n    This part of the energy is constant since `q` and `R` are fixed.\n\n*   **`U_sphere-sphere`**:\n    This is the sum of potential energies for all pairs of charges on the sphere. The number of pairs is `12 * (12 - 1) / 2 = 66`.\n    `U_sphere-sphere = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`\n    where `r_ij` is the distance between charge `i` and charge `j` on the sphere.\n\n**3. Minimize the Total Energy**\n\nTo find the minimum energy of the system, we need to find the configuration of the 12 sphere charges that minimizes `U_total`. Since `U_center-sphere` is constant, we only need to minimize `U_sphere-sphere`.\nMinimizing `sum(k * q^2 / r_ij)` is equivalent to maximizing the distances `r_ij` between the charges on the sphere. This is a famous problem in physics known as the **Thomson problem**. For N=12 charges on the surface of a sphere, the configuration that minimizes the repulsive potential energy is a **regular icosahedron**, where the charges are located at the vertices.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for the Icosahedral Configuration**\n\nWe need to calculate the sum of `1/r_ij` for all 66 pairs of vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R`. We can express this in a dimensionless form by factoring out `k * q^2 / R`:\n`U_sphere-sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * S_12`, where `S_12 = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (R / r_ij)`.\n\n`S_12` is a geometric constant for the icosahedron. It can be calculated by considering the distinct distances between vertices:\n*   There are 30 pairs of adjacent vertices, separated by the edge length `a`.\n*   There are 30 pairs of vertices separated by the face diagonal, `b`.\n*   There are 6 pairs of antipodal vertices, separated by the diameter, `c = 2R`.\n\nThe relationship between these distances and the circumradius `R` for an icosahedron are:\n*   `a = (4R) / sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5))`\n*   `b = a * φ`, where `φ` is the golden ratio, `(1 + sqrt(5))/2`.\n*   `c = 2R`\n\nThe sum `S_12` is:\n`S_12 = 30 * (R/a) + 30 * (R/b) + 6 * (R/c)`\n`S_12 = 30 * (R/a) + 30 * (R / (a*φ)) + 6 * (R / (2R))`\n`S_12 = 30 * (R/a) * (1 + 1/φ) + 3`\nUsing the identity `1 + 1/φ = φ`:\n`S_12 = 30 * φ * (R/a) + 3`\nSubstituting `R/a = sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) / 4`:\n`S_12 = 30 * φ * (sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) / 4) + 3`\n\nNow, we can write the total energy:\n`U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (k * q^2 / R) * S_12`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + S_12)`\n\n**5.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the System and Identify Energy Components**\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of this isolated system of 13 point charges is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. The system consists of:\n*   A central charge `q_c` fixed at a point P.\n*   12 charges (`q_s`) constrained to the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2` m, centered at P.\n*   All charges are identical: `q_c = q_s = q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n\nThe total potential energy can be divided into two distinct parts:\n1.  **`U_center_sphere`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_sphere_sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum:\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n\n**2.

Therefore, to minimize `U_total`, we must minimize `U_sphere_sphere`. This requires finding the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere's surface that maximizes their separation distances, thus minimizing their mutual repulsion energy.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in physics called the **Thomson problem**.

We can derive it or use the established formula. The calculation involves the golden ratio `φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2`. The result of the summation is:\n`S_12 = 7.5 * φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3 ≈ 49.1643`\n\nNow, we can assemble the formula for the total energy:\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (k * q^2 / R) * S_12`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + S_12)`\n\n**5.

The system consists of:\n*   A central charge `q_c` fixed at a point P.\n*   12 charges (`q_s`) constrained to the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2` m, centered at P.\n*   All charges are identical: `q_c = q_s = q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n\nThe total potential energy can be divided into two distinct parts:\n1.  **`U_center_sphere`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_sphere_sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum:\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n\n**2. Formulate the Energy Equations**\n\nThe potential energy between two point charges, `q_1` and `q_2`, separated by a distance `r` is given by Coulomb's law: `U = k * q_1 * q_2 / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`).\n\n*   **`U_center_sphere`**:\n    There are 12 pairs, each consisting of the central charge `q` and one charge `q` on the sphere. The distance for each pair is fixed at the radius `R`.\n    `U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q * q / R) = 12 * k * q^2 / R`\n\n*   **`U_sphere_sphere`**:\n    There are `12 * (12 - 1) / 2 = 66` pairs of charges on the sphere. The energy is the sum over all these pairs:\n    `U_sphere_sphere = Σ_{i<j} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`, where `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j` on the sphere.\n\n**3. Determine the Minimum Energy Configuration**\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum energy* of the system.\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + Σ_{i<j} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`\n\nThe first term, `U_center_sphere`, is constant because `k`, `q`, and `R` are fixed values. To minimize `U_total`, we must minimize the second term, `U_sphere_sphere`. Since `k * q^2` is a positive constant, minimizing this term is equivalent to minimizing the sum `Σ(1/r_ij)`. This occurs when the distances `r_ij` between the charges are maximized as much as possible.\n\nThis classic problem is known as the **Thomson problem**. For 12 charges on the surface of a sphere, the minimum-energy configuration is achieved when the charges are positioned at the vertices of a **regular icosahedron**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for the Icosahedral Configuration**\n\nFor the icosahedral arrangement, we can calculate `U_sphere_sphere` by summing the interaction energies. We can simplify this by factoring out the constant term `(k * q^2 / R)`:\n`U_sphere_sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * S_12`, where `S_12 = Σ_{i<j} (R / r_ij)` is a dimensionless geometric sum specific to the icosahedron.\n\nThe value of `S_12` for an icosahedron is a known constant, which can be derived by summing up the distances between all 66 pairs of vertices. The result is:\n`S_12 = 7.5 * φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3 ≈ 49.1643`\nwhere `φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2` is the golden ratio.\n\nNow, we can write the final expression for the total minimum energy:\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (S_12 * k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + S_12)`\n\n**5. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe will use a Python script to compute the final value accurately.\n\n**Parameters:**\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`\n*   `e ≈ 1.602177 x 10^-19 C`\n*   `q = 2e`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n*   `S_12 ≈ 49.1643`\n\n`U_total = (k * (2e)^2 / R) * (12 + 49.1643)`\n`U_total = (4 * k * e^2 / R) * (61.1643)`\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants and problem parameters\nk = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb's constant (N m^2/C^2)\ne = 1.602176634e-19 # Elementary charge (C)\nR = 2.0             # Radius of the sphere (m)\n\n# Calculate the charge of each particle\nq = 2 * e\n\n# Calculate the golden ratio\nphi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensionless geometric sum S_12 for the icosahedron\n# This value represents the sum of inverse distances for the 12 charges on the sphere\nS_12 = (7.5 * phi * math.sqrt(10 + 2 * math.sqrt(5))) + 3\n\n# Calculate the total minimum energy using the final formula\n# U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 [from center-sphere] + S_12 [from sphere-sphere])\ntotal_energy = (k * q**2 / R) * (12 + S_12)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation, formatted to three decimal places\nprint(f\"{total_energy:.3e}\")\n```\n2.822e-26\nThe calculation yields a value of `2.822 x 10^-26` Joules.
