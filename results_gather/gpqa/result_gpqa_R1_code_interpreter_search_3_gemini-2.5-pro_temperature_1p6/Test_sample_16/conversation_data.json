    "Here's my thinking process to solve this chemical equilibrium problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Initial (stoichiometric) concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}_{initial}$ = 0.02 M.\n    *   The formation constant (also known as the stability constant) for the complex is $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    *   The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". This is a key piece of information. The EDTA ligand ($H_4EDTA$) is a polyprotic acid. Its ability to bind to metal ions is pH-dependent. At low pH, it's protonated and doesn't bind well. At high pH, it's fully deprotonated to $EDTA^{4-}$ and binds most strongly. The given $K_f$ value is the absolute formation constant, which assumes the EDTA is fully in the $EDTA^{4-}$ form. \"Ideal pH\" implies we are at a high enough pH (typically pH > 10) where this assumption holds, so we can use the given $K_f$ directly without converting it to a conditional formation constant ($K'_f$).\n\n3.  **Set up the Chemical Equation:** The complex is dissolved in water, so it will be in equilibrium with its dissociated ions. The relevant reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n4.  **Relate the Reaction to the Equilibrium Constant:** The given constant, $K_f$, is for the *formation* reaction, which is the reverse of the dissociation:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    The expression for $K_f$ is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n5.  **Use an ICE Table to Define Equilibrium Concentrations:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is a standard method for organizing concentrations in equilibrium problems. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M)   |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, I'll plug the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the $K_f$ expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n7.  **Solve for x:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n    The value of $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which means the equilibrium lies heavily to the left (favoring the complex). This tells me that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows for a simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes much simpler:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, I can rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\n    Finally, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{0.4 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\sqrt{0.4} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-12}} \\approx 0.632 \\times 10^{-6}$ M\n\n    Converting to standard scientific notation:\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n8.  **Verify the Approximation:** The approximation was that $x \\ll 0.02$. My calculated value is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$, which is indeed much, much smaller than 0.02. So, the approximation was valid.\n\n9.  **Final Check and Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is $x = [Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    *   I'll compare this to the options:\n        A) 2.0x10^-2 M\n        B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n        C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n        D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    *   My result matches option D perfectly.\n\n10. **(Optional) Self-Correction/Rigorous Check:** To be absolutely certain, I can solve the full quadratic equation: $K_f \\cdot x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0$. For this, I can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nC_complex_initial = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10 # K for Ca-EDTA\n\n# We are solving the equilibrium: [Ca(EDTA)]2- <=> Ca2+ + EDTA4-\n# Let x = [Ca2+] = [EDTA4-] at equilibrium\n# Then [Ca(EDTA)]2- = C_complex_initial - x\n# The formation constant is Kf = [[Ca(EDTA)]2-]/([Ca2+][EDTA4-])\n# Kf = (C_complex_initial - x) / (x^2)\n# Kf * x^2 = C_complex_initial - x\n# This rearranges to the quadratic equation:\n# Kf * x^2 + x - C_complex_initial = 0\n# where a = Kf, b = 1, c = -C_complex_initial\n\na = Kf\nb = 1\nc = -C_complex_initial\n\n# We use the quadratic formula to solve for x: x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n# Since x represents a concentration, it must be positive, so we take the positive root.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\nca_ion_concentration = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n# Output the final answer formatted to two significant figures, matching the options.\nprint(f\"{ca_ion_concentration:.1e}\")\n```\n\nThe output from this code will confirm the result from the approximation method, giving me high confidence in the answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "*   **Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem describes a solution of a calcium-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻. In solution, this complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (EDTA⁴⁻). The dissociation reaction is:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Understand the equilibrium constant:** The given constant, KCa-EDTA = 5x10¹⁰, is the formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant. This constant describes the equilibrium for the *formation* of the complex, which is the reverse of the dissociation reaction:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\n    The expression for this formation constant is:\n    K_f = [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Consider the problem's conditions:**\n    *   The initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. This is the concentration before any dissociation occurs.\n    *   The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". The EDTA molecule is a polyprotic acid, and its ability to bind metals is pH-dependent. At high pH (typically > 10), it is almost fully deprotonated to EDTA⁴⁻, the form that binds most strongly. The given K_f value is the absolute constant, which assumes this ideal condition. Therefore, we don't need to adjust the K_f value for pH effects (i.e., we don't need a conditional formation constant, K'_f).\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We can use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    Based on the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ will be equal to the equilibrium concentration of EDTA⁴⁻, both represented by 'x'.\n\n5.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** Since K_f is a very large number (5 x 10¹⁰), the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make a simplifying approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n7.  **Calculate the value of x:**\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n        x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n        x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n        x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n        x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    *   Take the square root of both sides to find x:\n        x ≈ √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n        x ≈ √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n        x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Final check:**\n    The calculated value, x = 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M, is the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. This value is significantly smaller than 0.02 M, confirming that our initial approximation was valid. The result matches one of the provided options.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nFinal answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
