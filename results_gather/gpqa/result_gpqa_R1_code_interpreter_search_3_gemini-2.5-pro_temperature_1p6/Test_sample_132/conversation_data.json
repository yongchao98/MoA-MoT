    "The user wants to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical System**\n*   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n*   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2 H2O.\n*   The key species are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a conjugate acid-base pair. This means the solution is a buffer.\n*   The equilibria for phosphoric acid (H3PO4) are:\n    1.  H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4- (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n    2.  H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n    3.  HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\n### **2. Calculate Initial Concentrations**\nFirst, we need to calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n*   **Volume:** V = 200.00 cm³ = 200.00 mL = 0.200 L\n*   **For KH2PO4 (Source of H2PO4-):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n*   **For Na2HPO4●2H2O (Source of HPO4^2-):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n### **3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe pH of the buffer is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka2) since it involves the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- pair.\n\n*   Equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n*   Equilibrium expression: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]. For a buffer, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and conjugate base with their initial concentrations.\n\n*   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n*   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n### **4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is produced in the third dissociation step.\n\n*   Equilibrium: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n*   Equilibrium expression: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]. We will use the [H+] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-].\n\n*   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n*   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.234 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is very close to option D.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants based on the problem statement\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # in grams\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # in g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # in grams\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # in g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # in Liters (200.00 cm3 = 200.00 mL = 0.200 L)\nKa2 = 6.2 * 10**-8\nKa3 = 1.8 * 10**-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.\n# KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-).\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume\n\n# Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-).\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume\n\n# Step 2: The solution is a buffer governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n# We can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 expression.\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 3: Use the third dissociation of phosphoric acid to find the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) concentration.\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final result with appropriate scientific notation\nprint(f'{conc_PO4_3_minus:.3e}')\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.235e-07\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation gives the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] as 6.235 x 10^-7 M.

    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, in a buffer solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n\n### **1. Reasoning and Strategy**\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that dissociates completely into 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and water.\n    *   The solution therefore contains a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). This constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations** of the buffer components.\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Volume.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**. The pH of this buffer is governed by the equilibrium involving the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- pair, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n    *   H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n    *   The Ka2 expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻].\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]). We can use the initial concentrations of the buffer components as a very good approximation.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4³⁻]**. The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\n    *   HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   The Ka3 expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻].\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4³⁻]: [PO4³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]).\n    *   We will use the [H⁺] calculated in step 3 and the initial concentration of [HPO4²⁻].\n\n### **2.
