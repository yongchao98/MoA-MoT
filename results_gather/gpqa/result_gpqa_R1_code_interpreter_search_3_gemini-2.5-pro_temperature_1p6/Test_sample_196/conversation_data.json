    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of Compound X from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), where the broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value is typical for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n        *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) appearing far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded, likely because they are ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl side chain analysis:** Let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the second substituent.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a different methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is likely the methylene group (-CH₂-) which is coupled to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton at a relatively high chemical shift for an alkyl group. This suggests it is a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This is the methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:**\n            1.  The benzylic methine (-CH-) is at 2.9 ppm.\n            2.  It is attached to the methyl group giving the doublet at 1.4 ppm. This gives a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n            3.  It is also attached to the methylene group at 1.7 ppm. This methylene is in turn attached to the methyl group giving the triplet at 0.9 ppm. This gives a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) fragment.\n            4.  Connecting these pieces to the benzylic methine gives: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. Its name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with **red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain (sec-butyl) are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        -COOH group  →  -CH₃ group\n    *   **Final Product:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will be converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our deduced final product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is incorrect. We identified a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This structure is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Identify Compound X**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption band from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet for one proton far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**), confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a signature pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** We need to assemble the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals:\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This multiplet for a single proton is in the benzylic position (attached directly to the benzene ring). It must be a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is an ethyl group fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H is the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to both the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the benzylic methine (at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (the benzylic methine at 2.9 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-) bonded to the ring. This methine is also bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This combined group is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Identity of Compound X:** Putting all the pieces together, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydriodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and alkyl chains are not affected by this reagent.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group remains unchanged.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Matching with Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - The structure is incorrect.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Deciphering the Structure of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption band in the region of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive indicator of the O-H stretching vibration found in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The sharp, strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which slightly lowers the frequency from a non-conjugated acid.\n    *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are due to C=C stretching vibrations within the benzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet (bs) far downfield is the characteristic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded and appear further downfield.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's assemble the structure of the second substituent on the ring using the remaining signals:\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton. Its chemical shift indicates it is benzylic (directly attached to the benzene ring). It's a multiplet, meaning it has several neighbors. This is a methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   We can now deduce the groups attached to this benzylic methine.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This doublet for 3 protons must be a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the benzylic methine (-CH-), as `n+1=2` implies `n=1` neighbor.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet for 3 protons must be a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-), as `n+1=3` implies `n=2` neighbors.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This multiplet for 2 protons is the methylene group (-CH₂-). It is adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the benzylic methine at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The benzylic methine is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all fragments, we have a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group at the para (1,4) positions on a benzene ring. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Identifying the Reaction and the Final Product**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Compound X, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with **red phosphorus and HI** (hydriodic acid).\n*   **The Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. One of its key applications in organic chemistry is the complete reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) all the way down to methyl groups (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain are inert under these conditions.\n*   **The Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Change: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**3. Matching with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid — This is the starting material, not the final product.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene — This perfectly matches the predicted final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene — This has the wrong alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid — This structure is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (very broad):** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These are characteristic C=C stretching absorptions for an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).

The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, which deshields them. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Side-Chain Analysis:** We need to piece together the structure from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   Let's start with the ends of the chain. The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** signal is a triplet, so it's a -CH₃ group next to a -CH₂- group. The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** signal is a doublet, so it's a -CH₃ group next to a -CH- group.\n        *   The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** signal is a single proton, and its downfield shift indicates it is the benzylic proton (the one attached directly to the aromatic ring). It is a multiplet, meaning it has multiple neighbors. This must be the -CH- group that is adjacent to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm.\n        *   The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** signal is a -CH₂- group. It must be situated between the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the benzylic methine (-CH-) group at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-) that is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and HI** (hydriodic acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reagent mixture is a very powerful reducing agent. A key transformation it performs is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions.\n*   **The Product:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a -CH₃ group. The final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Final Answer Selection**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is the correct final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has the incorrect alkyl group isomer.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid is an incorrect structure.\n\n<<<B>>>",
