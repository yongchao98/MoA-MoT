    "*   **Step 1: Identify Substance X.**\n    *   The problem describes a series of chemical reactions and properties involving an unknown Substance X. Let's break down the clues.\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This strongly suggests a deuterated reagent. Common reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) have a well-known deuterated analog, lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4), used for isotopic labeling studies. Let's hypothesize that **X is LiAlD4**.\n    *   **Clue 2: \"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\"**.\n        *   If X is LiAlD4, a violent reaction would occur with water. The problem involves isotopes, so let's consider both normal water (H2O) and heavy water (D2O) as possibilities for liquid Y.\n        *   The gas W must have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test common small molecules.\n            *   Hydrogen (H2): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n            *   Hydrogen deuteride (HD): 2 protons, 1 neutron. No.\n            *   Deuterium (D2): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). Yes.\n        *   For D2 gas to be produced, both the hydride source (X) and the proton source (Y) must provide deuterium. This implies the reaction is between LiAlD4 (X) and heavy water, D2O (Y).\n        *   The reaction is: `LiAlD4 + 4D2O → LiOD + Al(OD)3 + 4D2`.\n        *   This reaction produces D2 gas (W), which fits the clue. The analogous reaction with LiAlH4 and H2O is known to be violent. So, this part is consistent.\n    *   **Clue 3: \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   In our proposed reaction, the products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble in D2O, and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)3), which is insoluble and would form a precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)3**.\n        *   Heating an aluminum hydroxide analog causes dehydration. Heating G (Al(OD)3) would produce aluminum oxide and heavy water: `2Al(OD)3 → Al2O3 + 3D2O`.\n        *   So, substance **B is D2O** (heavy water).\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H2O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D2O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is extremely close to the given 277 K, confirming that B is D2O.\n    *   **Clue 4: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   LiAlD4 (like LiAlH4) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   `R-CO-R'-COOH` --(1. LiAlD4 / 2. Workup)--> `R-CH(OH)-R'-CH2OH`.\n        *   The product is a diol, which contains two alcohol (-OH) groups, and therefore two oxygen atoms. This clue fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses.**\n    *   The formula for Substance X is **LiAlD4**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses of the isotopes involved. For this type of problem, using integer mass numbers is sufficient.\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of Lithium (the most common isotope is ⁷Li) = 7 amu.\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (only one stable isotope, ²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n    *   Identify the lightest and heaviest elements present in the molecule.\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, mass = 2 amu).\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (mass = 27 amu).\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This means we must sum the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element and the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element.\n    *   **Total mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium):** There are 4 deuterium atoms in LiAlD4.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   **Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 aluminum atom in LiAlD4.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of these two totals.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nTo confirm with more precise values:\n```python\n# More precise atomic mass of Deuterium (D) is ~2.014 u\n# More precise atomic mass of Aluminum (Al) is ~26.982 u\nnum_D = 4\nnum_Al = 1\ntotal_mass = (num_D * 2.014) + (num_Al * 26.982)\nprint(total_mass)\n```\n<execute_code>\n35.038\n</execute_code>\nThe precise calculation gives 35.038, which rounds to 35.\n\nThe final answer is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Decoding the identity of Substance X and related compounds.**\n    *   The problem describes a series of reactions and properties. Let's break them down clue by clue to identify Substance X.\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly suggests a common reagent where a light isotope is replaced by a heavier one. A prime candidate is the replacement of hydrogen (¹H) with deuterium (²H or D). Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common reagent in organic chemistry, and its deuterated analog, lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄), is frequently used for isotopic labeling. Let's hypothesize that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Clue 2:** \"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n        *   LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water. Therefore, LiAlD₄ (X) would also react violently with a similar liquid (Y).\n        *   Let's analyze gas W. A molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons is required.\n            *   Hydrogen gas (H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit.\n            *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits perfectly.\n        *   To produce pure D₂ gas, both the hydride source (X) and the proton source (Y) must provide deuterium. This implies the reaction is between LiAlD₄ (X) and heavy water, D₂O (Y).\n        *   The balanced reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`. This is consistent with the clues.\n    *   **Clue 3:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   In the proposed reaction, the product Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide) is insoluble and would form the precipitate G.\n        *   When aluminum hydroxide is heated, it dehydrates to form aluminum oxide and water. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield aluminum oxide and heavy water (B): `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. Thus, **B is D₂O**.\n        *   The melting point of normal water is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This value is extremely close to the stated 277 K, confirming that B is indeed heavy water.\n    *   **Clue 4:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (`C=O`) and a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n        *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   The reaction `R-(C=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂OH` (after workup).\n        *   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This clue also fits perfectly.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues consistently identify **Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses.**\n    *   The formula for Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form, Deuterium 'D').\n    *   We need to identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic mass. We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): Mass ≈ 2 amu\n        *   Lithium (⁷Li, the most common isotope): Mass ≈ 7 amu\n        *   Aluminum (²⁷Al, the only stable isotope): Mass ≈ 27 amu\n    *   Comparing the masses (2, 7, 27):\n        *   The **lightest element** present is Hydrogen (as Deuterium).\n        *   The **heaviest element** present is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative mass of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in one molecule of X.\n    *   **Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are four D atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   **Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one Al atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the two totals.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the detailed analysis:\n1.  **Substance X Identification**: The clues provided systematically lead to the identification of Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The \"heavier isotope\" and its use as a reagent in organic chemistry point towards a deuterated compound, with LiAlD₄ being a common example.\n    *   The reaction with liquid Y to produce a gas W with an equal number of protons and neutrons identifies W as Deuterium gas (D₂), and consequently Y as heavy water (D₂O). `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n    *   The precipitate G is Al(OD)₃, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B (~277 K) matches that of heavy water, D₂O (276.97 K).\n    *   The reaction with a keto acid confirms the reducing power of LiAlD₄, yielding a diol which contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Cumulative Mass**:\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements involved are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The mass numbers of the relevant isotopes are: D ≈ 2, ⁷Li ≈ 7, ²⁷Al ≈ 27.\n    *   The **lightest element** present is Hydrogen (in the form of Deuterium, mass 2).\n    *   The **heaviest element** present is Aluminum (mass 27).\n    *   The problem requires summing the total mass contribution of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium) in the molecule = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) in the molecule = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the detailed reasoning and step-by-step analysis performed previously:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance X:** All provided clues consistently point to Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. The reaction with heavy water (Y = D₂O) explains the formation of deuterium gas (W = D₂) and aluminum deuteroxide precipitate (G = Al(OD)₃). Heating G releases heavy water (B = D₂O), whose melting point (~277 K) matches the description. The reaction with a keto acid confirms the strong reducing properties of LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Cumulative Mass:**\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The mass numbers of the relevant isotopes are: D = 2 amu, Li ≈ 7 amu, Al = 27 amu.\n    *   The lightest element present is Hydrogen (as Deuterium), with an atomic mass of 2 amu.\n    *   The heaviest element present is Aluminum, with an atomic mass of 27 amu.\n    *   The problem asks for the cumulative mass, which means summing the total mass of all atoms of the lightest element and the total mass of all atoms of the heaviest element in the molecule.\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): There are four D atoms, so 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one Al atom, so 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nTherefore, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the detailed analysis provided in the reasoning process, all clues point to the identity of Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance X**:\n    *   **Heavier Isotope & Reagent**: The description fits a deuterated version of a common organic reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a staple, making its deuterated analog, LiAlD₄, a prime candidate.\n    *   **Reaction & Gas W**: The violent reaction points to a reaction with water. The gas W having an equal number of protons and neutrons is a perfect match for deuterium gas (D₂), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This implies the reaction is with heavy water (D₂O). The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n    *   **Precipitate G & Substance B**: The precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃).

The melting point of D₂O is 276.97 K, which is \"very close to 277 K\", confirming this identification.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction**: LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that would reduce a keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid) to a diol (containing two alcohol groups), which has two oxygen atoms.
