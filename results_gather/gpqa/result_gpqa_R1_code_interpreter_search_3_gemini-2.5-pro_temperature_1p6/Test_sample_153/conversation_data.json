    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher (M+2).\n    *   The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (since the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8% and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%, a ratio of about 3:1).\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (using the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   There is a very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is part of a conjugated system (like being attached to a benzene ring).\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n    *   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The fact that it's a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with) and integrates to one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   The total integration in this region is 2H + 2H = 4H, indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The splitting pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of equivalent protons to have different chemical shifts. The protons ortho (adjacent) to the more electron-withdrawing group will be further downfield.\n    *   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Putting It All Together and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the compound contains one chlorine atom (Cl).\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know it contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know these two groups are in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on a benzene ring.\n\nThis leads us to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check if this structure matches all the data:\n*   **Structure:** 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7×12) + (5×1) + (1×35) + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu (for ³⁵Cl). This matches the M+ peak. The MW for ³⁷Cl is 158, matching the M+2 peak.\n*   **IR:** Contains a -COOH group, which matches the broad O-H and sharp C=O peaks.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Contains a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and a *para*-substituted ring (two doublets, 2H each). The electron-withdrawing -COOH group deshields its ortho protons more than the -Cl group does, so the downfield doublet (8.02 ppm) corresponds to the protons next to the carboxyl group, and the upfield doublet (7.72 ppm) corresponds to the protons next to the chlorine. All NMR data fits perfectly.\n\n**Evaluation of other options:**\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** No carboxylic acid. Incorrect IR and NMR.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two doublets. Incorrect IR and NMR.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, its *ortho*-substitution pattern would produce a complex multiplet pattern for the 4 aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets. Incorrect NMR.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from three different spectroscopic techniques: Mass Spectrometry (MS), Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectroscopy. Let's break down the information from each technique.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (two mass units heavier) with a relative abundance of 32%. The intensity ratio of the M⁺ peak (100%) to the M⁺+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M⁺ to M⁺+2 is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl. The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to molecules containing ³⁵Cl, and the peak at m/z = 158 corresponds to molecules containing ³⁷Cl.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature. A very broad absorption in this region is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extensive broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization).\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region. Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (11.0 ppm):** Signals above 10 ppm are almost always due to the highly deshielded acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COO**H**).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates there are no adjacent protons, which is expected for a -COOH proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8.5 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons on the benzene ring, which means the ring is **disubstituted**.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (d, d):** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n### Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\n*   **MS tells us:** The molecule has a MW of 156 (with ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR and NMR tell us:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **NMR tells us:** The two substituents (a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group) are attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis information leads directly to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check the proposed structure against the options:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It is not a carboxylic acid and would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11 ppm or the very broad IR absorption.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **This structure is a perfect match.** It has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol, contains one chlorine atom and one carboxylic acid group, and the 1,4-substitution pattern explains the two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR and IR spectra would be completely different.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a much more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectral Data\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n    *   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The primary peak is at m/z = 156. This value represents the molecular weight of the molecule with its most common isotopes.\n    *   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%). This ratio of M⁺ to M⁺+2 intensities is approximately 3:1 (100:32 ≈ 3:1).\n    *   **Interpretation:** A 3:1 intensity ratio for the M⁺ and M⁺+2 peaks is a definitive signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%). The peak at 156 corresponds to molecules with ³⁵Cl, and the peak at 158 corresponds to molecules with ³⁷Cl.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n    *   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad signal is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extensive broadening is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its specific frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group that is conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the highly deshielded acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COO**H**). Its integration for one proton (1H) and singlet nature (s) confirm this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (for a total of four aromatic protons), is a classic fingerprint for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The two identical protons ortho (next to) one substituent are coupled to the two identical protons ortho to the other substituent.\n\n### Conclusion and Structure Determination\n\nCombining the information from all three spectra:\n*   We have a molecule with a molecular weight of 156 (containing ³⁵Cl).\n*   It contains one chlorine atom and one carboxylic acid group.\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads us to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check the proposed structure against the given options:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. Not a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data: it has the correct molecular weight, a carboxylic acid group, a chlorine atom, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring pattern.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. The *ortho* substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Its relative intensity is **32%** compared to the M⁺ peak (which is 100%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The M⁺ to M⁺+2 intensity ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single **chlorine atom**. The peak at 156 is from molecules with ³⁵Cl, and the peak at 158 is from molecules with ³⁷Cl.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration found in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).
