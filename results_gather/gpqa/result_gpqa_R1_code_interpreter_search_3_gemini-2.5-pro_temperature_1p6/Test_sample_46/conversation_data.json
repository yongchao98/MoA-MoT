    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The formula for calculating DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 3 pi bonds + 1 ring) and one additional pi bond (like a C=O or C=C bond).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is typical for an ester. It is too high for an amide (usually < 1690 cm⁻¹) and within the range for ketones, aldehydes, or esters. Given the other data, an ester is most likely.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet (t) that integrates to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet (q) that integrates to 2 protons (2H). This pattern is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   *Putting these two signals together (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm)*, we can confidently identify an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, most commonly an oxygen, as in an ester (-CO-O-CH2CH3) or an ether (-O-CH2CH3). This strongly supports the idea of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons (2H). A broad signal in this region is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of an amine (-NH2) or alcohol (-OH). Combined with the IR data (two N-H bands), this confirms the presence of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). They are both doublets (d), and each integrates to 2 protons (2H). This symmetrical \"doublet of doublets\" pattern is the hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester carbonyl, -COOR).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nAttaching the amine and the ethyl ester group to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure with the data:\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2 (Matches)\n*   **IR:** Has a primary -NH2 group and an ester C=O. (Matches)\n*   **NMR:** Shows the ethyl group of the ester, the amine protons, and the 1,4-disubstituted aromatic pattern with appropriate chemical shifts for electron-donating and withdrawing groups. (Matches perfectly)\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ester's alkyl group is attached to the ring oxygen. The NMR would be different (the aromatic protons next to the oxygen would be more shielded).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: All data points align perfectly with this structure.**\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted (1,3) isomer and an amide, not an ester. The IR carbonyl frequency and NMR aromatic pattern would be different.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in the 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ range is a classic signal for a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an alcohol (-OH) would typically show a single, broad band.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester** (typically 1735-1750 cm⁻¹). It is too high for an amide (usually < 1690 cm⁻¹) and within the range for ketones or aldehydes, but the presence of two oxygens in the formula makes an ester very likely.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet (split by two adjacent protons) and integrates to 3 protons. This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet (split by three adjacent protons) and integrates to 2 protons. This is a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-COO-**CH₂**-CH₃).\n    *   Combining the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. A broad signal is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). They are both doublets, each representing 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a higher field/lower ppm). The protons ortho (adjacent) to the -NH₂ are expected to be upfield.\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a lower field/higher ppm). The protons ortho to the ester are expected to be downfield.\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the 2 protons next to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the 2 protons next to the ester group.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n    *   The evidence points to a structure with a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This would have an ester oxygen bonded directly to the ring, changing the aromatic NMR signals, and the ethyl part of the NMR would belong to a propionyl group (O-CO-CH₂CH₃), with the CH₂ appearing around 2.2-2.5 ppm.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring with the correct electronic effects reflected in the NMR.\n    *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide (wrong IR C=O frequency) and is meta-substituted (would not give two doublets in NMR).\n    *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide (would only have one N-H peak in IR) and has a different overall structure.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the provided data, let's break down the structure of the compound C9H11NO2 step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula to calculate DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a **benzene ring** (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds) and **one additional π-bond**, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2.

Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, is the characteristic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, which shields the adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to a lower ppm value). The carbonyl group of the ester (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to a higher ppm value). Thus, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons next to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons next to the ester group.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region and other signals:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH₂- group is bonded to a very electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen of an ester **(-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons corresponds to the exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n\n### 4.
