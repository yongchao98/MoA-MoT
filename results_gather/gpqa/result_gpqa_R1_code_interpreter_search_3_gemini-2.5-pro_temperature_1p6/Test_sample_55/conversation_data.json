    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Process and States\nThe problem asks for a specific route and its probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition process.\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state.\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n*   **Process:** A cascade of two consecutive E1 transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|int\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    The path is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nE1 transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers:\n*   **Principal quantum number n:** $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$ can be any integer.\n*   **Orbital angular momentum quantum number l:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic quantum number m:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)\nLet's analyze the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   Initial state quantum numbers: $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-state.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n    *   Since this is a decay process, the energy of the intermediate state must be lower than the initial state. The energy of a hydrogen atom state depends on $n$ as $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$. Thus, we must have $n' < 3$. The possible values for $n'$ are 1 or 2.\n    *   If $n'=1$, then $l'$ must be 0, which contradicts $l'=1$. So, $n'$ cannot be 1.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   So, the possible intermediate states belong to the $2p$ subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nNow let's analyze the second transition from a possible intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Initial state for this step: $|n_i'=2, l_i'=1, m_i'=m'\\rangle$.\n*   Final state quantum numbers: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Applying selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. (Allowed)\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. (Allowed)\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = -m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$, which is true for all possible $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n*   This confirms that a two-step decay via the $2p$ states is a valid pathway. The problem specifies one such route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe \"probability\" of a specific decay route in a cascade process refers to the product of the branching ratios of each step. The branching ratio of a particular decay channel is the ratio of its partial decay rate to the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n*   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (3s state) is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This means it has no preferred orientation in space. As a result, when it decays, it must emit photons into the three possible final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) with equal probability. There is no physical reason to prefer one $m'$ value over the others.\n\n    More formally, the transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$, the rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or direct calculation (as shown in the thought process), one can prove that this squared matrix element has the same value for all three final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n\n    Let $\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$. Since the rate is the same for each $m'$, the total decay rate from the 3s state to the 2p level is $\\Gamma_{total, 1} = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_1 = 3\\Gamma_1$. (We neglect much slower decay processes like two-photon decay).\n\n    The branching ratio for decaying into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $B_1 = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total, 1}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{3\\Gamma_1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay further. According to the selection rules, a state with $n=2, l=1$ can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$ and $n<2$. The only state that satisfies this is the $n=1, l=0$ state, i.e., the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    Since this is the *only* allowed electric dipole decay channel from the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, the probability of this transition occurring is 1.\n    The branching ratio is $B_2 = 1$.\n\n*   **Overall Probability:**\n    The probability of the entire cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of the individual steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = B_1 \\times B_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, and the probability of this specific path being taken is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option D. The same logic would yield a probability of $1/3$ for the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ as well.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\nThe expression in LaTeX is:\nRoute: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\nProbability: $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the specific sequence of states and the probability of that sequence for a hydrogen atom decaying from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\n2.  **Identify the States:**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, which is the 3s state.\n    *   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, which is the 1s ground state.\n    *   Intermediate state: $|int\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    The E1 selection rules govern which transitions are allowed:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$ can be any integer. However, for spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which means $n$ must decrease ($n_f < n_i$).\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$. The parity of the state must change.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s) - First Transition:**\n    Let's analyze the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Initial quantum numbers: $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   Applying selection rules to find $|n', l', m'\\rangle$:\n        *   **Energy:** The energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$. Thus, $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n        *   **Angular Momentum (l):** $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-state.\n        *   **Check Consistency:** The quantum number $l'$ must be less than $n'$ ($l' < n'$).\n            *   If we chose $n'=1$, then we would need $l'=1$, but for $n=1$, only $l=0$ is allowed. So $n'=1$ is not possible.\n            *   This leaves $n'=2$. For $n'=2$, $l'=1$ is allowed. So, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$ and $l'=1$.\n        *   **Magnetic Quantum Number (m):** $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n    *   Conclusion for the intermediate state: The allowed intermediate states are the three states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Verify the Second Transition:**\n    Let's check if a transition from a 2p intermediate state to the final 1s state is allowed. We will use the specific route proposed in options C and D: $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Initial quantum numbers for this step: $n'_i=2, l'_i=1, m'_i=0$.\n    *   Final quantum numbers: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. (Allowed, energy decreases).\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. (Allowed).\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. (Allowed).\n    *   The transition is allowed. This confirms that $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid decay route. The other routes through $|2,1,\\pm 1\\rangle$ are also valid.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The \"probability\" of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step. A branching ratio is the probability of a system in a given state decaying via one particular channel, compared to all possible decay channels.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$.**\n        *   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (3s state). This state is spherically symmetric ($l=0$).\n        *   The only allowed E1 decay channels from the 3s state are to the 2p states (since $n=1, l=1$ is not possible).\n        *   Because the initial state is spherically symmetric and there are no external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom will decay to each of the three possible final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) with equal probability.\n        *   Total decay pathways from 3s = 3 (to the three 2p states).\n        *   The branching ratio for the specific channel to $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is therefore:\n            $$B_1 = \\frac{\\text{Rate to } |2,1,0\\rangle}{\\text{Total Rate from } |3,0,0\\rangle} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n        *   (This neglects other much slower decay mechanisms like two-photon decay, which is standard practice).\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.**\n        *   The atom is now in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$. We must consider all its possible E1 decay channels.\n        *   Applying the selection rules starting from $|2,1,0\\rangle$: we need $n_f < 2$ and $l_f = l \\pm 1 = 1 \\pm 1 = 0$ or $2$.\n        *   Since $n_f < 2$, we must have $n_f=1$. For $n=1$, only $l=0$ is possible.\n        *   So, the only state the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n        *   Since this is the only possible decay channel, it will happen with 100% certainty (its branching ratio is 1).\n            $$B_2 = 1$$\n\n    *   **Overall Probability for the Cascade:**\n        The total probability for the specified route is the product of the branching ratios of the individual steps.\n        $$P(\\text{route}) = B_1 \\times B_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

    "This problem describes a two-step decay process in a hydrogen atom, which must be governed by the electric dipole (E1) selection rules. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the first transition\n\nThe initial state is $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$. The atom undergoes an electric dipole transition to an intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\n1.  **Parity change:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$. Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n2.  **Angular momentum projection:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$. Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Energy conservation:** For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy. The energy of a state is given by $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$. To lose energy, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < n$. Since the initial state has $n=3$, the intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\nCombining these rules:\n*   We need $l'=1$.\n*   The quantum number $l'$ must be less than $n'$ ($l' < n'$).\n*   So, $n'$ must be at least 2.\n*   Since we also need $n' < 3$, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are the three states in the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All options C and D correctly identify one of these, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, as the intermediate state.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the second transition\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if this transition is allowed by the E1 selection rules for the route given in option D, which is $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - 0 = 0$. This is allowed.\n*   $n_f < n'$, i.e., $1 < 2$. This is an energy-releasing decay.\n\nThe proposed route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid two-step E1 decay path.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability\n\nThe probability of this specific cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **First step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It can decay to any of the three 2p states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. Because the initial state is spherically symmetric and in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction.

As per the selection rules, it must decay to a state with $n_f < 2$ and $l_f = l' \\pm 1 = 1 \\pm 1 = 0 \\text{ or } 2$.

    "The user wants me to solve a problem about the decay of a hydrogen atom. I will outline the steps and reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A non-relativistic hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Process:** A two-step decay (cascade emission).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Goal:** Determine the path of the decay (i.e., the intermediate state) and the probability (branching ratio) for that specific path.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:**\n    For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ via an E1 transition, the following rules for the quantum numbers must be satisfied:\n    *   **Principal quantum number ($n$):** $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$ can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so the energy of the final state must be lower, which implies $n_f < n_i$.\n    *   **Orbital angular momentum quantum number ($l$):** $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$. This rule implies that the parity of the state must change.\n    *   **Magnetic quantum number ($m$):** $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition Step:**\n    The first step is from the initial state $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l_i=0$, so $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l'=1$. The intermediate state must be a p-orbital.\n    *   Applying the energy rule: $n' < n_i$, so $n' < 3$. This means $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n    *   Combining these with the general rule that $l' < n'$: We need $1 < n'$. This eliminates the $n'=1$ possibility. Therefore, the intermediate state must have **$n'=2$**.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m_i=0$, so $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m'$. The allowed values are $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, so **$m' = 0, +1, \\text{or} -1$**.\n\n    Conclusion for the first step: The allowed intermediate states are the three states of the 2p subshell: $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$. The routes proposed in options C and D, with the intermediate state being $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, are valid possibilities.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition Step:**\n    The second step is from the intermediate state to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. Let's check the route proposed in options C and D: $|2, 1, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$ (Decay is possible).\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed by selection rules).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$ (Allowed by selection rules).\n    The entire cascade $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2, 1, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ is a valid decay pathway.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability of the Route:**\n    The overall probability of a specific cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each individual step. A branching ratio is the probability that an excited state will decay via a particular channel.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the First Step ($B_1$): $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2, 1, 0\\rangle$**\n        The initial state $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space. The allowed E1 decay channels are to the three states of the 2p subshell: $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$. Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state, the transition probability to each of these three sublevels is identical.\n        Therefore, the probability of decaying into any single one of them is one-third.\n        $B_1 = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of available channels}} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the Second Step ($B_2$): $|2, 1, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        Now the atom is in the state $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$. We must find all of its possible E1 decay channels. According to the selection rules, the final state must have $n_f < 2$ and $l_f = l' \\pm 1 = 1 \\pm 1$, so $l_f=0$ or $l_f=2$. Since $n_f < 2$, the only possibility is $n_f=1$. For $n=1$, the only allowed value of $l$ is $l=0$.\n        Thus, the *only* allowed E1 decay channel from the state $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$ is to the ground state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        Since this is the only path, its probability is 1.\n        $B_2 = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the specified route is the product of the individual branching ratios:\n        $P(\\text{route}) = B_1 \\times B_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Final Comparison with Options:**\n    The calculated route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. This exactly matches the information given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
