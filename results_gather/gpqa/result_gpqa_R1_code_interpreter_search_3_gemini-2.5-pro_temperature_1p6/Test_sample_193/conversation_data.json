    "This problem requires us to calculate the partition function for a system of three interacting spins. The partition function, Z, is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that encodes the statistical properties of a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n**1. Define the System and States:**\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n**2. The Energy Equation:**\nThe energy of any given state is determined by the formula:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\nwhere J is the coupling constant.\n\n**3. The Partition Function (Z):**\nThe canonical partition function is defined as the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for that state:\nZ = Σ_i exp(-β * E_i)\nwhere β = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n**4. Calculation Strategy:**\nWe will list all 8 possible microstates, calculate the energy E for each state, and then sum their respective Boltzmann factors, exp(-βE).\n\nLet's enumerate all 8 states and their energies:\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | E = -J * (Sum) |\n|:-----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:----------------------:|:----------------:|\n|   1   | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3          |      -3J         |\n|   2   | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1         |       +J         |\n|   3   | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1        |       +J         |\n|   4   | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1        |       +J         |\n|   5   | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1        |       +J         |\n|   6   | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1        |       +J         |\n|   7   | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1         |       +J         |\n|   8   | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3          |      -3J         |\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    *   This energy occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy (g1) is 2.\n    *   The contribution to Z from this energy level is 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) = 2 * exp(3Jβ).\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = +J:**\n    *   This energy occurs for the remaining six states.\n    *   The degeneracy (g2) is 6.\n    *   The contribution to Z from this energy level is 6 * exp(-β * J) = 6 * exp(-Jβ).\n\n**5.

    "The problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Understand the Partition Function**\nThe canonical partition function (Z) is a sum over all possible microstates (i) of the system, given by:\nZ = Σ_i exp(-βE_i)\nwhere β = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and E_i is the energy of the i-th microstate.\n\n**2. Enumerate All Possible States**\nSince there are three spins and each can take two values, the total number of microstates is 2^3 = 8. We need to list each state, calculate its energy, and then sum the Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list the states by the spin configuration (S1, S2, S3):\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)**\n    *   S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    *   Energy E₁ = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)**\n    *   S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    *   Energy E₂ = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 3: Two spins up, one spin down.** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(1)+(1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    So, there are 3 states with energy +J.\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down.** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(-1)+(-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   (-1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1.

Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\nWe can now see that there are only two distinct energy levels in the system:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E = -3J):** This occurs when all spins are aligned (all up or all down). There are **2** such states.\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E = +J):** This occurs when the spins are not all aligned (two up/one down or one up/two down). There are 3 + 3 = **6** such states.\n\n**4. Calculate the Partition Function**\nNow we sum the contributions from each energy level, remembering that Z = Σ (degeneracy) * exp(-βE):\n\n*   Contribution from E = -3J:  2 * exp(-β(-3J)) = 2 * exp(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from E = +J:   6 * exp(-β(+J))  = 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nAdding these contributions together gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nThis can be written as:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
