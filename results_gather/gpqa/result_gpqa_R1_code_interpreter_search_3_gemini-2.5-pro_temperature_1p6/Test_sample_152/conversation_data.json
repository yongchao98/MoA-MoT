This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, which serves as the nucleophile (the Michael donor).\n\n    3.  **Identify the Electrophilic Site:** In the α,β-unsaturated ester (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate), the β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n    4.  **Perform the Conjugate Addition:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition).\n        *   `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃` → `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n        *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate.\n\n    5.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) or during workup to yield the final stable product.\n        *   `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃` + EtOH → `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃` + EtO⁻\n\n    6.  **Name the Product (A):** The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. To name this using IUPAC nomenclature for compounds with more than two principal functional groups, we can name the carboxylic acid groups as substituents on the parent alkane chain.\n        *   Parent Alkane Chain: The longest chain connecting the carbons bearing the carboxylate groups is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n        *   Numbering: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)(COOMe)`.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor Precursor:** Dimethyl malonate (a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound).\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n*   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  **Formation of Nucleophile:** The base, NaOEt, removes a highly acidic proton from the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate (the carbon between the two ester groups) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n2.  **Conjugate Addition:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃ → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final product.\n    `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n\n**Product A:**\nThe final structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. To name this compound systematically, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups. This is a propane chain with ester groups at positions 1, 1, and 3, and a p-tolyl group at position 2.\nTherefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor (Enamine):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine). This is part of a Stork enamine alkylation.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (an α,β-unsaturated nitrile).\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as a solvent, followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  **Conjugate Addition:** The enamine acts as a nucleophile. The lone pair on the nitrogen pushes electron density to the β-carbon, which then attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the original ketone and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n2.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt, converting it back to a ketone at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Product B:**\nThe net result is the addition of a `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group to the α-carbon (C2) of cyclohexanone. The structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. Naming this compound with butanenitrile as the parent chain gives us a `2-oxocyclohexyl` substituent on the C3 position of the butanenitrile.\nThe major product is the keto form, not the enol, so the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Unknown Michael Donor Precursor:** C\n\n**Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards):**\n1.  A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the nucleophile's active site and the acceptor's β-carbon. The product shows that a \"3-oxobutyl\" group (from MVK) is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n2.  This means the bond was formed between C2 of the donor ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n3.  The nucleophile must therefore be the enolate of the donor molecule C, formed by the deprotonation of the C2-protons by the base KOH. These protons are acidic because they are located between two carbonyl groups.\n4.  Therefore, reactant **C** must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Summary of Results:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing this to the given choices:\n*   A) Incorrect name for A.\n*   B) Incorrect name for A.\n*   C) Correct names for A and B, but incorrect identification of C (gives the enol form, which is not the standard representation of the starting material).\n*   D) Correct names for A and B, and correct identification of C.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a detailed, step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct reactants and products.\n\n### **Reaction A Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`)\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`)\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n*   **Step 1: Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate)**\n    The strong base, sodium ethoxide (`EtO⁻`), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The resulting enolate is stabilized by resonance across both ester groups, making it an excellent \"soft\" nucleophile for conjugate addition.\n    `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition (Conjugate Addition)**\n    The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester. The π-electrons shift, creating a new enolate intermediate.\n    `[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + p-tolyl-C(β)H=C(α)H-COOCH₃ → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n*   **Step 3: Protonation**\n    The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the stable final product.\n    `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n*   **Step 4: Naming Product A**\n    The structure of the product is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. To name this according to the convention in the options, we identify a three-carbon chain as the parent: `C_malonate - C_β - C_α`. When named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate, this structure is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (as Enamine):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. In this reaction (a Stork enamine alkylation), the enamine acts as an enol equivalent, with the α-carbon of the original ketone (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) being nucleophilic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH), followed by acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Step 1: Michael Addition**\n    The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Step 2: Hydrolysis**\n    The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt, regenerating the ketone at C1 of the cyclohexane ring. The piperidine is removed as a salt.\n*   **Step 3: Structure of Product B**\n    The net result is the formation of a bond between the α-carbon of cyclohexanone (C2) and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The added group is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`. The final product is cyclohexanone substituted at the 2-position.\n*   **Step 4: Naming Product B**\n    The structure is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one. Naming this as a derivative of butanenitrile gives the name **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product after acidic workup, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction C Analysis**\n\n*   **Knowns:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`\n    *   **Base:** KOH\n    *   **Unknown:** Reactant C (Michael donor precursor)\n*   **Step 1: Retrosynthesis**\n    A Michael addition creates a C-C bond between the nucleophile's active carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n*   **Step 2: Identify Fragments**\n    The product has two parts:\n    1.  The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    2.  A `-(β)CH₂-(α)CH₂-CO-CH₃` group (the \"3-oxobutyl\" substituent) attached at C2 of the ring. This fragment came from the Michael acceptor, MVK.\n*   **Step 3: Deduce Reactant C**\n    Since the bond formed at C2 of the dione, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the starting material C, formed by the base (KOH) removing a proton from C2. The protons at C2 of a 1,3-dione are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **Step 4: Identify Reactant C**\n    Therefore, the reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) for workup.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt, regenerating the ketone at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Product B: Structure and Name**\n    *   The net reaction adds a `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group to the α-carbon (C2) of cyclohexanone.\n    *   When named as a derivative of butanenitrile, the parent chain is the 4-carbon nitrile. The cyclohexanone ring is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` substituent attached at position 3 of the nitrile chain.\n    *   The final major product is the keto form, not the enol. Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns (Retrosynthesis):** We must work backward from the product to find the starting reactant C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Base:** KOH.\n\n2.  **Deduction of Reactant C:**\n    *   The product consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `3-oxobutyl` (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`) group attached at the C2 position.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group comes from the Michael acceptor, MVK.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. This means the C-C bond was formed between C2 of the donor molecule and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   For this to happen, the C2 position of reactant C must be deprotonated by the base (KOH) to become nucleophilic. The protons at the C2 position of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound are highly acidic and easily removed.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
