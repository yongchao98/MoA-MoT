    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects:**\n    The reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with an existing substituent. The substituent determines two things: the reaction rate (activation/deactivation) and the position of the incoming bromine atom (orientation). The question asks to order the substances based on the yield of the *para-isomer*.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:**\n    We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n    *   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They generally lead to a high yield of ortho and para products.\n        *   `-CH3` (1, Toluene): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n        *   `-C2H5` (5, Ethylbenzene): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n        *   `-Cl` (3, Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n    *   **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves. They lead to a very low yield of the para product.\n        *   `-NO2` (4, Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n        *   `-COOH` (6, Benzoic Acid): Deactivating, meta-director.\n        *   `-COOC2H5` (2, Ethyl Benzoate): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Initial Grouping:**\n    Based on the directing effects, we can form two groups:\n    *   **Low Para-Yield Group (meta-directors):** Substances 4, 6, and 2.\n    *   **High Para-Yield Group (ortho, para-directors):** Substances 1, 5, and 3.\n    Therefore, the final ordered list must have substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning, followed by substances {1, 5, 3}.\n\n4.  **Order within the Low Para-Yield Group (Meta-Directors):**\n    We need to arrange `4 (-NO2)`, `6 (-COOH)`, and `2 (-COOC2H5)` in increasing order of para-isomer yield. For meta-directors, the para yield is always very small. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. The stronger the effect, the more selectively the meta-isomer is formed, and the lower the trace amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   The deactivating strength of these groups is generally accepted as: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   This means `-NO2` will produce the least para product, followed by `-COOH`, and then `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   So, the order of increasing para yield is: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n5.  **Order within the High Para-Yield Group (Ortho, Para-Directors):**\n    We need to arrange `1 (-CH3)`, `5 (-C2H5)`, and `3 (-Cl)` in increasing order of para-isomer yield. For these, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the competition with the ortho-isomers. The ratio of para to ortho product is key.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The `-C2H5` group is sterically bulkier than the `-CH3` group. This makes it more difficult for the incoming bromine to attack the ortho positions of ethylbenzene compared to toluene. As a result, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para product than toluene. So, `para yield (1) < para yield (5)`.\n    *   **Halogen Effect:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) in chlorobenzene is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), but it directs ortho/para due to resonance (+R effect). The strong inductive effect disfavors the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This leads to a very high para/ortho ratio. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, which is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%).\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: `1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)`.\n\n6.  **Combine the Orders:**\n    Now we combine the two ordered groups.\n    *   First, the meta-directors in their established order: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n    *   Then, the ortho, para-directors in their established order: `1 < 5 < 3`.\n    *   The complete order of increasing para-isomer yield is: `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    This derived order corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer upon electrophilic bromination. The key is to understand how different substituents on the benzene ring affect both the orientation (directing effect) and the specific ratio of isomers (ortho vs. para).\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:** First, we classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an ortho/para-director or a meta-director. This initial classification separates the compounds into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n    *   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n        *   `-CH3` (in substance 1, Toluene): Alkyl group, activating, o,p-director.\n        *   `-C2H5` (in substance 5, Ethylbenzene): Alkyl group, activating, o,p-director.\n        *   `-Cl` (in substance 3, Chlorobenzene): Halogen, deactivating, but o,p-director.\n\n    *   **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low for these compounds.\n        *   `-NO2` (in substance 4, Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n        *   `-COOH` (in substance 6, Benzoic acid): Deactivating, meta-director.\n        *   `-COOC2H5` (in substance 2, Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n    Based on this, the compounds with meta-directors (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear at the beginning of the sequence. The compounds with ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3) will have higher yields and will appear at the end.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2):**\n    For meta-directors, the yield of the trace para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing to the meta position, leaving an even smaller percentage for the para position.\n    The order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n    `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n    *   The `-NO2` group is a very strong deactivator.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is a moderately strong deactivator.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` because of the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C2H5).\n\n    Therefore, the substance with the strongest deactivator (`-NO2`) will have the lowest para yield, and the one with the weakest (`-COOC2H5`) will have the highest (within this low-yield group).\n    The order of increasing para yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3):**\n    For these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. The para yield depends on factors like steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n    *   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making it more difficult for the incoming bromine to attack there. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered para position is favored. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n    *   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** Halogens are a special case. The chloro group (`-Cl`) is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but it directs ortho/para due to its electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The strong inductive effect significantly deactivates the adjacent ortho positions compared to the more distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high para-to-ortho product ratio for halobenzenes. In bromination, chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer (around 87-89%). This yield is typically higher than for activated rings like toluene or ethylbenzene.\n\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Orders:**\n    Now, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directing group comes first, followed by the ortho, para-directing group.\n    *   Meta-director order: `4 < 6 < 2`\n    *   Ortho, para-director order: `1 < 5 < 3`\n    *   Combined order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis final order matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires arranging six substituted benzenes in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the directing effect of the substituent (meta vs. ortho/para) and factors like steric hindrance and electronic effects that influence the ortho/para ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents into Directing Groups**\n\nFirst, we divide the substituents into two main categories: meta-directors and ortho/para-directors.\n*   **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer. The substituents `-NO2`, `-COOH`, and `-COOC2H5` fall into this category.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer. The substituents `-CH3`, `-C2H5`, and `-Cl` are ortho, para-directors.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nBased on this, the final sequence must have the meta-directing compounds (4, 6, 2) at the beginning, followed by the ortho/para-directing compounds (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the amount of the trace para-isomer formed is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at forcing meta-substitution, thus producing even less of the para product.\nThe order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   `-NO2` is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   `-COOC2H5` is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` due to the mild electron-donating nature of the ethyl group attached to the oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate.\n**Order: 4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor ortho/para-directors, we need to consider the factors that determine the ratio of para to ortho products.\n*   **Steric Hindrance (`-CH3` vs. `-C2H5`):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) in substance 5 is larger and more sterically bulky than the methyl group (`-CH3`) in substance 1. This increased bulk hinders the attack of bromine at the adjacent ortho positions, thereby favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. As a result, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer compared to toluene (1). So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Halogen Effect (`-Cl`):** The chloro group in substance 3 is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal but directs ortho/para due to electron donation via resonance. The powerful inductive effect strongly deactivates the ortho positions (which are closer) more than the para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high selectivity for the para position. The bromination of chlorobenzene yields approximately 87-89% para-isomer, which is significantly higher than that for toluene or ethylbenzene. Thus, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para yield in this group.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para yield for the ortho, para-directors is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n**Order: 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nBy combining the two groups, we get the complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.\n\n(Meta-Directors) < (Ortho, Para-Directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the electrophilic bromination of the given substances.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by their Directing Effects**\n\nThe substituent already present on the benzene ring dictates where the incoming bromine atom will attach. We can classify them into two main groups:\n\n*   **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they produce very little of the para-isomer. These compounds will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro group): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxyl group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester group): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. These compounds will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer and will have the highest yields.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl group): Activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro group): Deactivating, but ortho, para-director.\n\nFrom this classification, we know that the final ordered list must start with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the tiny amount of para product formed is inversely related to the strength of the group's deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more effective at directing meta, leading to an even smaller yield of the para product.\n\nThe deactivating strength of these groups follows this order: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   The `-NO2` group is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least para-isomer.\n*   The `-COOH` group is the next strongest.\n*   The `-COOC2H5` ester group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these compounds, we must consider the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho product.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (`-CH3` vs. `-C2H5`):** Both are activating ortho, para-directors. The key difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C2H5` in substance 5) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3` in substance 1). This larger size blocks the ortho positions, making it more favorable for the incoming bromine to attack the less crowded para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with the Halo Group (`-Cl`):** The chloro group in substance 3 is a special case. It is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect), but it directs ortho/para because of electron donation via resonance (+R effect). The strong inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor causes a very high preference for para substitution. The bromination of chlorobenzene yields an exceptionally high percentage of the para-isomer (around 87-89%), which is greater than that for either toluene or ethylbenzene.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups to get the final sequence:\n(Meta-Directors) < (Ortho, Para-Directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem asks us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic bromination. The key to solving this is understanding how each substituent directs the incoming electrophile and influences the product distribution.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents into Directing Groups:**\n    First, we must classify each substituent as either a meta-director or an ortho, para-director. This initial sort will separate the compounds into two groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n    *   **Meta-Directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low.\n        *   Substance 4: `-NO2` (Nitro group)\n        *   Substance 6: `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group)\n        *   Substance 2: `-COOC2H5` (Ester group)\n        These three compounds will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will be at the beginning of our ordered list.\n\n    *   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   Substance 1: `-CH3` (Methyl group)\n        *   Substance 5: `-C2H5` (Ethyl group)\n        *   Substance 3: `-Cl` (Chloro group)\n        These three compounds will have the highest para-isomer yields and will be at the end of our ordered list.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, and 2):**\n    For these compounds, the para-isomer is a very minor byproduct. The yield of this byproduct is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more efficient at directing the reaction to the meta position, leaving an even smaller fraction to form the para-isomer.\n\n    The order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n    `-NO2` (strongest) > `-COOH` (intermediate) > `-COOC2H5` (weakest of the three).\n\n    Therefore, the compound with the strongest deactivating group (`-NO2`) will have the lowest para-yield. The order of increasing para-yield is:\n    **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, and 3):**\n    For these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This ratio is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n    *   **Comparing `-CH3` (1) and `-C2H5` (5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size physically blocks the ortho positions, making it harder for the bromine electrophile to attack there. This favors substitution at the less hindered para position. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) produces a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n\n    *   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** Halogens are a special case. The chloro group is deactivating overall due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, but it directs ortho/para because its lone pairs can donate electron density through resonance. The strong inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than it deactivates the distant para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high selectivity for the para position. The bromination of chlorobenzene gives an exceptionally high yield of the para-isomer (around 87-89%), which is significantly higher than for either toluene or ethylbenzene.\n\n    Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n    **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n4.  **Combine the Orders into the Final Sequence:**\n    We now assemble the full sequence by placing the ordered meta-director group before the ordered ortho, para-director group.\n\n    (Lowest para-yields) < (Highest para-yields)\n    (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\n    The final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
