    "The user wants to find the value of the constant \"a\" in a given wave function.\n\n**1. Understand the concept of Normalization**\nIn quantum mechanics, the wave function ψ(x) describes the state of a particle. The probability of finding the particle in a given region of space is determined by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². Since the particle must exist *somewhere* in the space it's allowed to be, the total probability of finding it in that space must be 1 (or 100%). This is known as the normalization condition.\n\n**2. State the Normalization Condition Mathematically**\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the interval between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density function over this interval must be equal to 1.\n∫_1^3 |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**3. Determine the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²**\nThe given wave function is ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.\nThis is a complex number.

Set up the Normalization Integral**\nNow we substitute this expression back into the normalization equation:\n∫_1^3 (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**5. Solve the Integral**\nWe can solve the integral by splitting it into two parts:\n∫_1^3 (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫_1^3 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **First part:**\n    ∫_1^3 (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² ∫_1^3 (1 / (1 + x)) dx\n    The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.\n    So, a² [ln(1 + x)]_1^3 = a² (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)) = a² (ln(4) - ln(2))\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), this becomes:\n    a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2)\n\n*   **Second part:**\n    ∫_1^3 0.25 dx = [0.25x]_1^3 = 0.25(3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n**6.
