    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the concepts:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a moving particle (meson resonance X). This distance depends on the particle's speed and its lifetime in the laboratory frame. The lifetime in the lab frame is dilated due to relativistic effects compared to its proper lifetime (lifetime in its rest frame). The proper lifetime is related to the decay width of the particle.\n\n2.  **Relate Decay Width ($\\Gamma$) and Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):**\n    The decay width and the proper mean lifetime are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\Gamma = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_0}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    This gives the proper lifetime:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Effects (Time Dilation):**\n    The meson X is produced with high energy ($E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$), so it travels at a relativistic speed. Its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation:\n    $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\n    Given:\n    $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Distance ($L$):**\n    The mean decay distance is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame during its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n    where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    We can write $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$.\n    So, $L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression for $L$:**\n    It's more convenient to work with energy and momentum. We know that the relativistic momentum $p$ is given by $p = \\gamma m v$. We can write the term $\\beta \\gamma$ as:\n    $\\beta \\gamma = \\frac{v}{c} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}} = \\frac{\\gamma v}{c} = \\frac{p}{m_X c} = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2}$\n    The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$. We can find $pc$ from this:\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n    Substituting everything back into the equation for $L$:\n    $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\cdot (c \\tau_0) = \\left(\\frac{pc}{m_X c^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\\right) = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    So the final formula is:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    We need the value of $\\hbar c$, which is approximately $197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$.\n    Let's convert all energy units to MeV:\n    $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    $\\hbar c = 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m)\n\n    Now, let's plug these values into the formula.

This is described by the time dilation formula:\n    $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma = E_X / (m_X c^2)$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Use Quantum Mechanics (Uncertainty Principle):** The decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) of an unstable particle is related to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\Gamma_X = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_0}$\n    This means the proper lifetime is $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$.\n\n5.  **Combine the Formulas:** By substituting the expressions for $\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$ and $\\tau_0$ into the initial distance formula, we get:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}} = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = v\\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n6.  **Express in Terms of Momentum and Energy:** It is more convenient to work with relativistic momentum ($p$) and energy ($E$). The product $v\\gamma$ can be rewritten using the definition of relativistic momentum, $p = \\gamma m_X v$:\n    $v\\gamma = \\frac{p}{m_X}$\n    To work with standard high-energy physics units, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $c^2$:\n    $L = \\frac{p c}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    The momentum term $pc$ can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2 \\implies pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n\n7.  **Final Formula for Calculation:** Substituting the expression for $pc$, we arrive at the final formula:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will now insert the given values into this formula. It is crucial to use consistent units, so we convert everything to MeV.\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   The value of the physical constant $\\hbar c$ is approximately $197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\nTo ensure precision, we use a Python script to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Description of the problem: Calculate the mean decay distance of a meson resonance.\n# The formula L = (pc / m*c^2) * (hbar*c / Gamma) is used, derived from special relativity\n# and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\n# --- Input Values ---\n# All energies are converted to a consistent unit (MeV).\nE_X_MeV = 8000.0      # Production energy in MeV\nm_X_c2_MeV = 1200.0   # Rest mass energy in MeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0   # Decay width in MeV\n\n# --- Physical Constants ---\n# The product of the reduced Planck constant and the speed of light.\n# Units are MeV*fm, which is convenient for particle physics calculations.\nhbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# Step 1: Calculate the relativistic momentum term (pc) using the energy-momentum relation.\npc_MeV = math.sqrt(E_X_MeV**2 - m_X_c2_MeV**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay distance (L) using the final derived formula.\n# The result will be in femtometers (fm).\nL_in_fm = (pc_MeV / m_X_c2_MeV) * (hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV)\n\n# Step 3: Convert the distance from femtometers (fm) to meters (m) for the final answer.\n# Conversion factor: 1 fm = 1e-15 m.\nL_in_m = L_in_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation to match the format of the provided options.\nprint(f\"{L_in_m:.4e}\")\n```\n>>>\n4.0655e-15\nThe calculation yields a result of $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ meters.\n\nWhen we compare this value to the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe computed value matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
