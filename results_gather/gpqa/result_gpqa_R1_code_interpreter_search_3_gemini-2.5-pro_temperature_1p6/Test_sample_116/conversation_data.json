    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation about an axis, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomers), allenes, and spiranes.\nA molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a derivative of biphenyl, where two phenyl rings are connected by a carbon-carbon single bond.\n*   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'): two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The presence of these large groups at the ortho positions causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation is a condition for **atropisomerism**. The rings are forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation. In this twisted state, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Because it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, it is chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's focus on the central carbon atom (C2), which is the one bonded to the hydroxyl group. This carbon atom is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   Since the C2 atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon of the carbonyl group is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three entities (two phenyl groups and one oxygen atom), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, it has a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group and bisects the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar around the rigid C=C double bond. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (shows optical isomerism)\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (shows optical isomerism)\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (does not show optical isomerism)\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (does not show optical isomerism)\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine which of the organic moieties show optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, as in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n    *   The positions ortho to the connecting single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   The steric hindrance from these large ortho-groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central C-C single bond. This restricted rotation forces the rings into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   In this fixed, twisted conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, a type of axial chirality. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since the carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. Two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized, as it is part of a double bond. It is bonded to only three entities (one oxygen atom and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, the molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compound **1** (due to atropisomerism) and compound **2** (due to a chiral center) are chiral and show optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each of the given compounds for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. Usually, there is free rotation around this bond. However, in this specific molecule, all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are substituted with large groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The bulky nature of these substituents causes significant steric hindrance, preventing the free rotation of the phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one attached to the -OH group):\n    *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This carbon is sp² hybridized and is bonded to only three entities, so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule is planar due to the rigid double bond. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, the molecule has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.

The two phenyl rings are linked by a single bond. Typically, rotation around this bond is free. However, in this case, all four positions ortho to the bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with large, bulky groups (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups). These bulky groups clash with each other, preventing the rings from rotating freely. This restricted rotation is known as **atropisomerism**. It forces the rings into a twisted, non-planar conformation that lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.

The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.

The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry containing the molecule itself. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.
