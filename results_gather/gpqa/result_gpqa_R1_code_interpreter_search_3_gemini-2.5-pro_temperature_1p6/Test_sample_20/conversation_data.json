    "**Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two constitutional isomers, most commonly the keto and enol forms.

    "This problem requires us to apply our knowledge of tautomerism and optical isomerism to four different organic compounds.\n\n### **Part 1: Tautomerism in Benzoquinone vs. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n\n**Concept of Tautomerism:**\nTautomerism is a form of constitutional isomerism where two isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can be readily interconverted. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. This process typically requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). The acidic alpha-hydrogen moves from the alpha-carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, and a double bond shifts to form an enol (`-C=C-OH`).\n\n**Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n*   **Structure:** It is a cyclic molecule with a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). Its formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n*   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized.\n*   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** While these alpha-carbons are bonded to hydrogen atoms, these hydrogens are on sp²-hybridized carbons. They are not considered alpha-hydrogens in the context of standard keto-enol tautomerism because the C-H bond on an sp² carbon is much stronger and less acidic, making the proton transfer difficult.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not have the required sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens, so it **does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n**Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n*   **Structure:** It is a cyclic molecule with a six-membered saturated ring containing three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n*   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons to two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons has two hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the negative charge that results from their removal is stabilized by resonance with *two* adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has highly acidic alpha-hydrogens and readily undergoes tautomerization to form its extremely stable enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. Therefore, it **does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism in Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs. Dimethyl fumarate**\n\n**Concept of Optical Isomerism:**\nOptical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism shown by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n**Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** It is the *trans* isomer of an alkene, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The molecule contains no sp³-hybridized carbon bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are part of a double bond (sp²-hybridized). Therefore, there are no chiral centers.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center at the midpoint of the C=C bond). Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem has two parts. First, we must identify which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does not show tautomerism. Second, we must identify which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is an equilibrium phenomenon where two isomers, known as tautomers, readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   These α-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required structural feature (an sp³-hybridized α-carbon with H atoms) to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups at alternating positions (1, 3, and 5). The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   These -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are alpha to two carbonyl groups each. The hydrogen atoms on these carbons are acidic α-hydrogens.\n    *   Due to the presence of these α-hydrogens, this molecule readily undergoes tautomerization to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is a very stable aromatic compound.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's analyze the central carbon (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃.\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is H₃COOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Since the molecule is symmetric and superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a two-step analysis based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry: tautomerism and stereoisomerism.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two constitutional isomers, most commonly the keto and enol forms. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen** — a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone has a six-membered ring structure with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks the necessary sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with attached hydrogens, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to two carbonyl groups each.

Thus, it shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Achiral molecules cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem is divided into two parts. The first part asks to identify which compound out of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism. The second part asks to identify which compound out of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in a state of rapid equilibrium. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the interconversion between a keto form (containing a carbonyl group, C=O) and an enol form (containing a hydroxyl group attached to a double-bonded carbon, C=C-OH). For this type of tautomerism to occur, there must be an **alpha-hydrogen** — a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon with an attached hydrogen atom, it cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups (methylene groups).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** These methylene carbons are sp³-hybridized and are alpha (adjacent) to two carbonyl groups each. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to readily undergo tautomerism. It exists in equilibrium with its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus highly stable compound. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\nSo, for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism exhibited by chiral molecules.

It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** H₃COOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans* isomer of the molecule.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no sp³-hybridized carbons bonded to four different groups in this molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion (a type of symmetry element) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\nSo, for part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nCombining the results from both parts:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
