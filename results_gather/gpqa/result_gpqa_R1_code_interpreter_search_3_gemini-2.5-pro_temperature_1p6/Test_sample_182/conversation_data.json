    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to understand what will happen during the reaction.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** Cyclohex-3-ene. This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one double bond (C=C). A ring itself contributes 1 to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), and the double bond contributes another 1.\n*   **Functional Groups and Substituents:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This group is at position 1. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl group (-CHO):** This is an aldehyde group, at position 2. It also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2):** This group is at position 5. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), contributing 1 to the IHD.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Reactant (Optional but good for verification)**\n\nLet's find the molecular formula of the starting material.\n*   Ring: C6H7 (base C6H12, minus 2 for double bond, minus 3 for substituents)\n*   -COOH group: 1C, 1H, 2O\n*   -CHO group: 1C, 1H, 1O\n*   -CH=CH2 group: 2C, 3H\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Oxygens (O) = 2 + 1 = 3\n*   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\nThe IHD of the reactant can be calculated from its structure:\n*   IHD = (1 for the ring) + (1 for C=C in the ring) + (1 for C=O in COOH) + (1 for C=O in CHO) + (1 for C=C in vinyl group) = **5**.\n*   Using the formula IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = **5**. This confirms the structure.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus (Red P) and excess Hydroiodic Acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and sites of unsaturation (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all double bonds and all oxygen atoms, leaving behind a saturated hydrocarbon. The carbon skeleton remains intact.\n\n*   The **cyclohexene ring** becomes a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **-COOH group** at position 1 becomes a **-CH3 group**.\n*   The **-CHO group** at position 2 becomes a **-CH3 group**.\n*   The **-CH=CH2 group** at position 5 becomes a **-CH2CH3 group**.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, although the exact name is not required to solve the problem). The key is that it is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n\nThe number of carbon atoms remains 10. The product is a saturated cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a saturated cycloalkane is CnH2n.\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the definition**\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n    For the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane:\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated)\n    IHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    The formula for IHD is IHD = C + 1 - H/2\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = **1**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem asks for the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from a specific reaction. Let's break down the problem into three main steps:\n1.  Determine the structure of the starting material (reactant).\n2.  Understand the chemical transformation caused by the reagents (Red P and excess HI).\n3.  Determine the structure and IHD of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\nLet's identify the sources of unsaturation in this molecule. The IHD is calculated as the sum of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The C=C double bond within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl (-CHO):** This is an aldehyde functional group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl (-CH=CH2):** This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nAdding these up, the IHD of the reactant is:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus (Red P) with excess Hydroiodic Acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful and non-selective reducing agent. Its function is to reduce almost all sites of unsaturation and oxygen-containing functional groups completely to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n\nHere's how it affects the different parts of the reactant molecule:\n*   All **C=C double bonds** (in the ring and the vinyl group) will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   All **C=O double bonds** (in the carboxylic acid and formyl group) will be reduced.\n*   The **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** will be completely reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n*   The **formyl group (-CHO)** will be completely reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n*   The **vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** will be reduced to an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n*   The **cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a **cyclohexane ring**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product and its IHD**\n\nAfter the reaction, all double bonds are gone, and all oxygen atoms are removed. The original carbon skeleton is preserved, but it is now fully saturated. The product will be a substituted cyclohexane.\n\nThe structure of the product is a cyclohexane ring with three alkyl substituents.\n*   It has one ring.\n*   It has zero pi (π) bonds.\n\nThe IHD of a molecule is calculated by the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\nFor the product:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Alternative Method (Using Molecular Formula)**\n\n1.  **Reactant Formula:** The reactant (C10H12O3) has an IHD of 5.\n    IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = 5. (This confirms our structural analysis).\n\n2.  **Product Formula:** The reaction preserves all 10 carbon atoms but removes all oxygen and adds hydrogen to saturate the molecule. The resulting structure is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n    Since C = 10, the product's molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n3.  **Calculate Product IHD from Formula:**\n    IHD = C + 1 - H/2\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - 20/2\n    IHD = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency for the final product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
