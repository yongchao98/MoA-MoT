    "This problem requires a step-by-step determination of the products of a multi-step organic synthesis reaction, followed by an analysis of the final product's structure to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with Br2 to replace one of the alpha-hydrogens with a bromine atom. Since both alpha positions are equivalent, the product is uniquely **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n2-bromocyclohexanone is an alpha-halo ketone. When treated with a base like NaOH and heated, it can undergo several reactions. The most likely possibilities are E2 elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   **E2 Elimination Path**: Abstraction of the proton at the C6 position (the other α-position) would lead to the formation of cyclohex-2-enone.\n*   **Favorskii Rearrangement Path**: This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanone intermediate, which then undergoes ring-opening to form a cyclopentane derivative. The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-bromocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after neutralization of the sodium salt).\n\nTo decide which path is correct, we look at the subsequent reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\nThe reaction with SOCl2 and pyridine is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid (-COOH) into an acyl chloride (-COCl). If Product 2 were cyclohex-2-enone, its reaction with SOCl2 is not a standard, high-yield transformation. However, if Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, this reaction proceeds cleanly. This strongly suggests that the Favorskii rearrangement occurred in Step 2.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n*   The reaction of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid with SOCl2/pyridine converts the carboxylic acid group into an acyl chloride. So, **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3), forming product 4.**\nProduct 3 is an acyl chloride (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride). Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is well-known for reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at that stage without proceeding to the primary alcohol. This is in contrast to the more reactive LiAlH4, which would reduce it all the way to an alcohol.\nTherefore, the acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Final Analysis: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)?**\n\nLet's draw the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde and analyze its symmetry to count the number of sets of equivalent hydrogens. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n        O\n       //\n      C — H (a)\n     /\nH(b)—C(1)\n    /  \\\nH(c)-C(2)—C(5)-H(d)\nH(e)|      | H(f)\n    C(3)——C(4)\n    | \\    / |\nH(g) H(h)  H(i) H(j)\n\n\nDue to rapid ring flipping, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-H(b) bond and the entire CHO group, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes certain protons chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H(a))**: This proton is unique in its chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (H(b))**: This methine proton is attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5**: The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (e.g., H(c) and H(e)) are diastereotopic because one is 'cis' and the other is 'trans' to the aldehyde group, and they cannot be interchanged by symmetry operations. Thus, they are chemically distinct. The symmetry plane makes H(c) equivalent to H(d) and H(e) equivalent to H(f). This gives us two more sets of distinct protons: {H(c), H(d)} and {H(e), H(f)}. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4**: The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two geminal protons on C3 (H(g) and H(h)) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The symmetry plane makes H(g) equivalent to H(i) and H(h) equivalent to H(j). This gives us another two sets of distinct protons: {H(g), H(i)} and {H(h), H(j)}. (2 distinct types)\n\nSumming up the number of distinct types of hydrogens:\n*   1 (aldehyde H)\n*   1 (C1-H)\n*   2 (from C2/C5 protons)\n*   2 (from C3/C4 protons)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThis corresponds to 6 signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂).**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reaction:** α-bromination\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\nThis is a reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. The characteristic reaction under these conditions is the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n1.  A hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the other α-hydrogen (from C6), forming an enolate.\n2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, breaking the bond between C1 and C6 to relieve ring strain. This leads to the formation of a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n5.  This carbanion is protonated by water, and after neutralization of the basic mixture (an implied workup step), the final product is a carboxylic acid with a contracted ring.\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reaction:** Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n*Alternative Consideration:* An E2 elimination could also occur, which would yield cyclohex-2-enone. However, the subsequent reaction strongly suggests the Favorskii pathway is the correct one.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid (-COOH) into an acyl chloride (-COCl). The reaction of a carboxylic acid with SOCl₂ confirms that Product 2 was indeed cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Conversion of carboxylic acid to acyl chloride.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃).**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive carbonyl compounds like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reaction:** Partial reduction of an acyl chloride.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Now, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in its structure. We look for protons in different chemical environments. We can use the symmetry of the molecule to help.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      H(a)\n      |\n  O==C\n      |\nH(b)-C1\n   /   \\\nH(c)-C2---C5-H(d)\n    |     |\nH(e)-C3---C4-H(f)\n```\nLet's simplify the representation for analysis:\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon, the hydrogen attached to C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (H on CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Methine proton (H on C1):** This proton is attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group. It is also in a unique environment. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*), meaning they are chemically distinct from each other. The same is true for C5. Due to symmetry, the *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives us two distinct sets of protons from these four. (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the case above, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and thus distinct. The same is true for C4. By symmetry, one set of protons on C3/C4 is equivalent, and the other set is also equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of protons from these four. (2 types)\n\n**Counting the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde proton (1H)\n*   Type 2: C1 proton (1H)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 protons (2H total, one type)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 protons (2H total, another type)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 protons (2H total, one type)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 protons (2H total, another type)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the multi-step synthesis and the analysis of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis is an α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) to replace a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) with a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is a symmetric molecule, both α-positions are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reaction:** α-bromination\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\nProduct 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone, an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heated, it undergoes a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\nThe mechanism involves:\n1.  Deprotonation at the other α-carbon (C6) by the base.\n2.  The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bonded to the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate.\n4.  The intermediate collapses, breaking one of the bonds to the original carbonyl carbon, leading to a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n5.  After workup (neutralization), the final product is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reaction:** Favorskii rearrangement\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\nProduct 2, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, is a carboxylic acid. The reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard laboratory method for converting a carboxylic acid (-COOH) into a more reactive acyl chloride (-COCl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Conversion of carboxylic acid to acyl chloride.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\nProduct 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride, an acyl chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive derivatives like acyl chlorides to aldehydes (-CHO). It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol, unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reaction:** Mild reduction of an acyl chloride.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. A hydrogen atom's chemical environment determines its signal in an NMR spectrum. Atoms that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like a plane of symmetry) are chemically equivalent.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's count the sets of unique protons based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique electronic environment. (1 type of H)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached. It is also unique. (1 type of H)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is 'cis' (on the same side) and one is 'trans' (on the opposite side) relative to the aldehyde group in the time-averaged structure. The 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. This gives two more sets of distinct protons. (2 types of H)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two sets of distinct protons.

    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the reaction sequence and the final structural analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis is an acid- or base-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted with a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, both α-positions are identical.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a reaction known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid functional group (after an acidic workup, which is implied).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is reacted with thionyl chloride. This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid (-COOH) into an acyl chloride (-COCl), which is more reactive. Pyridine is added as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\nProduct 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for reducing highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, and importantly, it stops the reaction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Final Analysis: Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.

However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic (one is closer to the aldehyde group, one is further). The same is true for the protons on C5. By symmetry, the two \"closer\" protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"further\" protons are equivalent to each other. This creates two distinct sets of protons from these four hydrogen atoms. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on the remaining carbons (C3 and C4):** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent.

    "Here is the detailed step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction of cyclohexanone with bromine (Br₂).**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a cyclic ketone) and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction involves the substitution of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) with a bromine atom.\n*   **Structure of Cyclohexanone:** It is a symmetrical six-membered ring with a ketone group. The carbons on either side of the carbonyl group (the α-positions) are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction will place one bromine atom on an α-carbon. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction of Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat.**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (an α-halo ketone) and a strong base (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** When an α-halo ketone with at least one α'-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the other α-carbon) is treated with a strong base, it undergoes a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate followed by ring opening, which often leads to ring contraction.\n*   **Mechanism outline:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bonded to the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 fashion, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained intermediate, causing the ring to open. This breaks the original C1-C6 bond, resulting in a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) with a carboxylate group attached.\n    4.  A subsequent acidic workup (implied in such problems) protonates the carboxylate to form a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction of Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard and very common method for converting a carboxylic acid (-COOH) into an acyl chloride (-COCl).

Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄, it is selective for reducing highly reactive carbonyl compounds like acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Partial reduction of an acyl chloride to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** The acyl chloride group (-COCl) is reduced to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Final Task: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).**\nTo do this, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Chemically distinct hydrogens occupy unique positions that cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation (like rotation or reflection). These unique hydrogens will produce separate signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the bond between the opposite carbons (C3 and C4).\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton:** The single hydrogen atom in the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment.

However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic—one is 'cis' and one is 'trans' to the aldehyde group). By symmetry, the 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. This gives us **two** distinct types of hydrogens from these four positions. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also mirror images and equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives us another **two** distinct types of hydrogens.
