    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **Product Name:** 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (position 2). An ethyl group is attached to position 4.\n*   **Chirality:** The carbon at position 4, bonded to the ethyl group, is a chiral center. Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **2. Determine the Precursor for Lactonization**\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   To form a six-membered lactone (δ-lactone), the precursor must be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   Let's number the precursor that would form the product: `HOOC(C1)-CH2(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH2(C4)-CH2(C5)-OH`.\n*   Under acidic conditions (H+), the hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid on C1 to form the lactone ring.\n*   The chiral center in this precursor is at C3. The stereochemistry of this C3 center will directly determine the stereochemistry of the C4 center in the final lactone product. No bonds to the chiral center are broken during lactonization, so the configuration is retained. Therefore:\n    *   To form **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    *   To form **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe proposed starting material in the options is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   **Structure:** `HOOC(C1)-CH2(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH2(C4)-COO-iBu(C5)`. This molecule is a monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at C5.\n*   The chiral center is at C3, which can be either (R) or (S).\n\nThe goal of the reaction is to convert this starting material into the required 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid precursor. This involves reducing one of the carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the other intact.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Required precursor:** (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Transformation needed:** `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu` → `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n*   This transformation requires the **selective reduction of the ester group** to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride). LiBH₄ is a strong reducing agent that can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids. However, it is generally known to reduce esters *faster* than carboxylic acids (which, as carboxylate salts under the reaction conditions, are less electrophilic). Therefore, LiBH₄ can be used for the selective reduction of an ester in the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction requires the (R)-precursor and this reduction does not affect the chiral center at C3, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Required precursor:** (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Transformation needed:** The options imply B has the same base structure as A. Let's assume the reduction must produce the same 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid structure, but with (S) stereochemistry. This again requires **selective reduction of the ester group**.\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane). Borane is well-known for its high selectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids rapidly but typically does *not* reduce esters.\n*   **The Dilemma:** This creates a contradiction. To form the necessary 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid precursor, the ester must be reduced. However, BH₃ selectively reduces carboxylic acids, not esters.\n*   **Resolving the Contradiction:** We must re-examine the proposed starting materials and the reaction. All options provide the same type of starting material. Let's assume there's a different way to form the lactone. If BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid, the product would be `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` (a hydroxy-ester). This cannot form the product lactone.\n*   The most plausible explanation is that there is a misunderstanding in the standard textbook selectivity rules as applied to this specific problem, or the question implies a different, less common reaction pathway for BH₃. However, based on the overwhelmingly standard selectivity of BH₃, it should not produce the required precursor from the given starting material structure.\n*   Let's reconsider the problem from a multiple-choice perspective. We are highly confident that for Reaction 1, A is the (R)-isomer. This eliminates options A and B. We are left with C and D. Both C and D correctly identify A as the (R)-isomer. The only difference is the stereochemistry of B.\n*   Given that the reaction with BH₃ produces the (S)-lactone, it must have started from the (S)-precursor, which in turn must have come from the (S)-starting material. This assumes that BH₃, under the conditions of the problem, *does* selectively reduce the ester, even if this contradicts its usual known selectivity profile. Following this logic: Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** Must be the (R)-isomer to produce the (R)-lactone.\n    A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Starting Material B:** Must be the (S)-isomer to produce the (S)-lactone.\n    B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Precursors**\n\n*   Both reactions produce a lactone, specifically **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).\n*   Lactones are formed via intramolecular cyclization of hydroxycarboxylic acids. A six-membered lactone is formed from a **5-hydroxycarboxylic acid**.\n*   The specific precursor needed is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**. Let's draw it: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`.\n*   The chiral center in this precursor is the carbon bearing the ethyl group (C3). Upon cyclization, this carbon becomes C4 in the lactone.\n*   The cyclization step (lactonization) does not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   To form **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    *   To form **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options propose starting materials of the type **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   The structure is: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n*   This molecule is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu).\n*   The task is to selectively reduce one of these carbonyls to form the required 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid precursor. This requires reducing the **ester group** to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Goal:** Convert starting material **A** into **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids. However, it is known to reduce esters more readily than carboxylic acids (or, more accurately, the carboxylate salts formed under basic/neutral conditions). Therefore, LiBH₄ is suitable for the selective reduction of the ester group in the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction happens at the ester carbonyl, which is not the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is directly transferred to the product. To obtain the (R)-precursor, starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   This conclusion eliminates options A and B.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Goal:** Convert starting material **B** into **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a highly chemoselective reagent. It is well-known for rapidly reducing carboxylic acids but being unreactive towards esters. This presents a conflict: the desired transformation requires reducing the ester, but the given reagent (BH₃) should reduce the carboxylic acid instead.\n*   **Resolving the Conflict:** While there's a chemical inconsistency in the problem statement (BH₃ should not perform this specific transformation), we must deduce the intended answer from the options. The structure of the problem strongly implies a test of stereochemistry. The only way to produce the (S)-lactone product is to start with a precursor that has (S) stereochemistry. Since the reduction step does not affect the chiral center, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For reaction 1, to get the (R)-product, starting material **A** must be the **(R)-isomer**.\n*   For reaction 2, to get the (S)-product, starting material **B** must be the **(S)-isomer**.\n\nThis corresponds to the following pairing:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires an understanding of the stereochemistry of reactions and the selectivity of different reducing agents.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and the Necessary Precursor:**\n    *   The product in both reactions is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n    *   Lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group and a hydroxyl group.

In the final lactone product, it is carbon-4.\n    *   The lactonization process (ring formation) does not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained from the precursor to the final product.\n        *   To form the **(R)-lactone**, the precursor must be **(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n        *   To form the **(S)-lactone**, the precursor must be **(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material and the Required Transformation:**\n    *   The proposed starting material is **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`. This molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   To get the required 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor, we must selectively **reduce the ester group to an alcohol** (`-COOiBu` → `-CH₂OH`) while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) unchanged.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting material A):**\n    *   **Goal:** Form the **(R)-lactone**. This means starting material **A** must be converted into the **(R)-precursor**.\n    *   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that is strong enough to reduce esters but is known to be much slower at reducing carboxylic acids (which exist as carboxylate salts under non-acidic conditions). Therefore, LiBH₄ can be used to selectively reduce the ester group in the presence of a carboxylic acid, which is exactly the transformation needed.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the ester's carbonyl carbon, which is not the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.

This means starting material **B** must be converted into the **(S)-precursor**.\n    *   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n    *   **Selectivity:** This is the key point of contrast. Borane (BH₃) is a highly selective reagent known for reducing carboxylic acids much faster than esters. In fact, it is often used to selectively reduce an acid in the presence of an ester. This is the *opposite* of the selectivity required to form the lactone precursor from the given starting material.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Despite this apparent contradiction in reagent choice (which might be an error in the problem statement), the question's logic must be followed to find the best answer. The reaction is stated to produce the (S)-lactone. For this to happen, the precursor must have the (S) configuration. Since the reduction step does not affect the chiral center, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)-isomer**: **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer to produce the (R)-lactone.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer to produce the (S)-lactone.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1.

Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids (which exist as less reactive carboxylate salts under neutral/basic conditions).

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure and Required Precursor**\n\n*   Both reactions produce **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n*   A six-membered lactone is formed from a **5-hydroxycarboxylic acid** through an intramolecular esterification reaction, usually under acidic conditions (as indicated by the H⁺ in the workup).\n*   The specific precursor needed to form the product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. Let's draw its structure and number it:\n    `HOOC(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-CH₂(C5)-OH`\n*   The chiral center in the precursor is at C3. When the molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid on C1. This reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3. The C3 of the precursor becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n*   Therefore, the stereochemistry is conserved from the precursor to the final lactone:\n    *   To obtain the **(R)-lactone** (Reaction 1), the precursor must be **(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   To obtain the **(S)-lactone** (Reaction 2), the precursor must be **(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material and the Necessary Transformation**\n\n*   The options provide the starting material as **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.

Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Required precursor:** (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent.

Therefore, LiBH₄ is a suitable choice for selectively reducing the ester group in the presence of the carboxylic acid, which is precisely the transformation needed.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the carbonyl carbon of the ester, which is not the chiral center. Thus, the configuration of the starting material is retained in the precursor. To get the **(R)-precursor**, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.
