    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of the host star's spectral lines. The star \"wobbles\" as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be redshifted when it moves away from us and blueshifted when it moves towards us. The amount of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's line-of-sight velocity ($v_{rad}$). The maximum observed shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a relationship between the wavelength shifts and the RV amplitudes for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\n    Given:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n\n    So, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude ($K$) to Orbital Parameters:** The RV amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by a formula that connects it to the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the orbital period ($P$). A simplified version, which is sufficient here, starts with the conservation of momentum and Kepler's laws.\n\n    Let's assume the planet mass is much smaller than the star mass ($m_p \\ll M_{star}$), which is stated to be the case (Neptune-like planet, Sun-like star). The star's velocity amplitude $K$ is related to the planet's orbital velocity $v_p$ by:\n    $M_{star} \\cdot K \\approx m_p \\cdot v_p$\n    $K \\approx \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} v_p$\n\n    From Kepler's Third Law and the formula for orbital velocity ($v_p = 2\\pi a / P$, where $a$ is the orbital radius), we can find a relationship between the planet's velocity $v_p$ and its period $P$:\n    $v_p \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n    Combining these two relations, we get:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Periods:** The problem states that the two stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the two planets have the same mass ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). Therefore, the terms $m_p$ and $M_{star}$ are constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n    This means that $K \\cdot P^{1/3}$ is a constant. We can write this for both systems:\n    $K_1 \\cdot P_1^{1/3} = K_2 \\cdot P_2^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods ($P_2/P_1$):** We need to find \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation from the previous step:\n    $\\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $(\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    Now, cube both sides to solve for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the ratio of the RV amplitudes (which is the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3$\n\n    Now, we'll perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1 is related to the ratio of the RV amplitudes K1/K2.\n# The RV amplitudes are proportional to the observed wavelength shifts.\n\n# Wavelength shift for planet #1's host star\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5.0\n\n# Wavelength shift for planet #2's host star\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7.0\n\n# The ratio of RV amplitudes is K1/K2\nK1_over_K2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# The relationship derived from orbital mechanics is P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3\nP2_over_P1 = K1_over_K2 ** 3\n\nprint(P2_over_P1)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The relationship between the star's radial velocity amplitude (K), which is proportional to the observed spectral line shift, and the planet's orbital period (P) can be derived from Kepler's laws.

    "The user has asked for a solution to the problem. I will provide the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of the host star. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. This causes the star to \"wobble,\" moving towards and away from Earth.

In either case, the $\\sin i$ term would cancel out in the ratio.)\n\n**3.

The relationship simplifies to:\n\n$K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nThis implies that the product $K \\cdot P^{1/3}$ is constant.

    "The user wants a solution to the astronomy problem. The reasoning and calculation have been performed in the previous steps. I will now synthesize this into a final, clear answer.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity and Wavelength Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of the host star's spectral lines.
