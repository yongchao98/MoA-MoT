    "Here's my thinking process to solve this special relativity problem.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   I need to find the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta.\n    *   This distance must be measured from the perspective of the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   I'm given the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy.\n    *   I'm given the time that has passed in the ejecta's own reference frame.\n    *   This is a classic special relativity problem involving time dilation.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Reference Frames:** There are two inertial reference frames. Let's call them:\n        *   **S' (Ejecta's frame):** The frame of reference where the ejecta is at rest. The clock in this frame measures the *proper time*.\n        *   **S (Galaxy's frame):** The frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance. The clock in this frame measures the *dilated time*.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving clock runs slower as observed by a stationary observer. The time interval measured in the frame where events occur at the same place (the proper time, Δt₀) is shorter than the time interval measured in a frame moving relative to it (Δt).\n    *   **Formula for Time Dilation:** Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    *   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor quantifies the time dilation effect. It is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²), where 'v' is the relative velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n    *   **Distance Formula:** The distance traveled in a given reference frame is the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame (d = v * Δt).\n\n3.  **List the Given Variables:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v` = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Proper time in the ejecta's frame, `Δt₀` = 50 s.\n    *   Speed of light, `c` ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Step-by-Step Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ). To do this, I first need the ratio `v/c` and then `(v/c)²`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Use the time dilation formula to calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).\n    *   **Step 3:** Use the standard distance formula (d = v * Δt) to calculate the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan (Calculation):**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate γ**\n        *   `v/c` = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n        *   `(v/c)²` = (0.2)² = 0.04\n        *   `1 - (v/c)²` = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96\n        *   `γ` = 1 / √0.96\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate Δt**\n        *   `Δt` = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate Distance (d)**\n        *   `d` = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [ (1 / √0.96) * 50 s ]\n        *   `d` = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km\n        *   `d` = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km\n\n    This calculation looks a bit complex for mental math, so I'll use Python to compute the final value precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndt0 = 50   # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the beta squared term (v/c)^2\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d)\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * dt\n\nprint(distance_in_galaxy_frame)\n```",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   Frame S: The Galaxy's stationary reference frame.\n    *   Frame S': The ejecta's moving reference frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the ejecta's frame (S') is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.

    "This is a classic problem in special relativity that involves the concept of time dilation.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **The Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   **The ejecta's reference frame (Frame S'):** This is the moving frame.

    "The problem describes a classic scenario from special relativity involving time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **Frame S (The Galaxy):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n*   **Frame S' (The Ejecta):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time measured in the ejecta's frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is called the **proper time** because it's the time measured by a clock at rest in its own frame.\n*   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal:**\n*   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame (S). The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's.\n\n**4. Apply Time Dilation:**\nAccording to the principle of time dilation, a clock moving relative to an observer will appear to tick slower. This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`).\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Calculation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   Calculating the value: `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option A. A non-relativistic calculation would incorrectly give `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option B), but since time in the Galaxy's frame runs \"faster\" from the ejecta's perspective, the distance covered is greater.\n\n<<<A>>>"
