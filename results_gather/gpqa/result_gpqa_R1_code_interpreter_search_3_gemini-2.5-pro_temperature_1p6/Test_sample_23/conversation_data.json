    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: %H = (y * mass(H)) / (x * mass(C) + y * mass(H)).\n    *   Using atomic masses H ≈ 1 and C ≈ 12, we get: %H = y / (12x + y).\n    *   14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   Setting the equation: y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives: 7y = 12x + y.\n    *   Simplifying gives: 6y = 12x, which reduces to y = 2x.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   Z is described as a saturated hydrocarbon because it \"does not react further with hydrogen\". A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. Alkenes have the same general formula but are unsaturated.\n    *   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its components is substance Z. Let's call the other component D. So, Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means both Z (the cycloalkane) and D must be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n        *   `Z + H2 --> Z` (no reaction, as it's saturated).\n        *   `D + H2 --> Z`.\n    *   This implies D is a compound that can be hydrogenated to form Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it is most likely an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires severe conditions, which fits the description.\n    *   The most plausible pair for (D, Z) is (Benzene, Cyclohexane).\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits the CnH2n formula for n=6 and is a common solvent.\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6). It does not decolorize bromine water (without a catalyst) and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions (`C6H6 + 3H2 --> C6H12`).\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Benzene (C6H6) and Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. So, X = {A, B}.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds.\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (Cyclohexane). This means both A and B must be C6 hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. They are therefore C6 cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   The core reaction is the disproportionation of X to Y when heated with platinum: `X --(Pt, heat)--> Y`.\n    *   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written on a molecular level as: `A + B --> Z + D`.\n    *   Substituting the identified substances: `A + B --> Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   Let the formula for liquid A be C6Ha and for liquid B be C6Hb (since they both have a C6 skeleton).\n    *   The balanced chemical equation for the disproportionation is:\n        `C6Ha + C6Hb --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   For hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 12 + 6`.\n    *   Therefore, `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B, which is `a + b`.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n5.  **Final Check**\n    *   Can we find plausible structures for A and B? Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   `a = 10`, `b = 8`. So `a + b = 18`. This works.\n    *   Do they fit the other criteria?\n        *   Both are C6 liquids that decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexene has one double bond (no conjugation). This fits.\n        *   The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 --> C6H12 + C6H6` represents a hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) and is chemically sound.\n    *   The logic holds.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the final product Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer atomic masses: H=1, C=12.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 14.28 / 100`.\n    *   The fraction 14.28/100 is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7y = 12x + y`.\n    *   Simplifying, we get `6y = 12x`, which reduces to `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for substance Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is the final product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a common solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z. Let's call the other one D.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both Z and D are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under \"severe conditions\" yields only Z.\n        *   Z is already saturated, so it won't react with hydrogen (`Z + H2 -> Z`).\n        *   Therefore, substance D must hydrogenate to form Z (`D + H2 -> Z`).\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but reacts with hydrogen under severe conditions to form a cycloalkane (Z), D must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires such severe conditions.\n    *   For D to hydrogenate to Z, they must have the same number of carbon atoms. The most common aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6). If D is benzene, then Z must be cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits all our criteria for Z (CnH2n formula, cycloalkane, common solvent).\n    *   So, we can confidently identify:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means that both A and B are hydrocarbons with a six-carbon skeleton that can be converted to cyclohexane.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation of mixture X to mixture Y: `X -> Y`. Since the mixtures are equimolar, we can write the reaction on a per-molecule basis: `A + B -> Z + D`.\n    *   Substituting the identified substances for Z and D, the reaction is:\n        `A + B -> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n    *   Let the molecular formula for A be C6Ha and for B be C6Hb (we know they are C6 hydrocarbons).\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is:\n        `C6Ha + C6Hb -> C6H12 + C6H6`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms.**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be equal on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        *   Total hydrogens on the reactant side = a + b\n        *   Total hydrogens on the product side = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18\n    *   Therefore, `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B. This value is `a + b`.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n*Self-consistency check:*\nCan we find plausible structures for A and B?\nWe need two C6 hydrocarbons (A and B) that are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), have no conjugated double bonds, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The reaction `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6` must be a plausible hydrogen transfer.\nLet A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n- Hydrogen count: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches.\n- Hydrogenation: Both hydrogenate to C6H12. Correct.\n- Unsaturation: Both decolorize bromine water. Correct.\n- Conjugation: Cyclohexene has one double bond (no conjugation). 1,4-Cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (non-conjugated). Correct.\n- Reaction: The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a valid hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the hexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane. This is a plausible disproportionation.\n\nThe logic is sound.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(Total mass of hydrogen) / (Total mass of the molecule) * 100%`.\n    *   Using the atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), this is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) * 100% = 14.28%`.\n    *   The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.1428).\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   By cross-multiplication, we get `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated (cannot be hydrogenated further) must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent that fits the CnH2n formula (for n=6).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (which we've deduced is likely cyclohexane). Let's call the other component D.\n    *   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\", meaning both Z and D are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Mixture Y under \"severe conditions\" gives only substance Z.\n    *   The reaction is `Z + D + H₂ --(severe conditions)--> only Z`.\n    *   Since Z is already saturated, it does not react: `Z + H₂ -> no reaction`.\n    *   Therefore, substance D must react with hydrogen to form Z: `D + H₂ -> Z`.\n    *   For D to be converted into the cycloalkane Z, it must have the same number of carbon atoms. As D does not decolorize bromine water but is converted to a saturated compound under severe hydrogenation, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires such severe conditions.\n    *   If Z is Cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be Benzene (C6H6). The hydrogenation reaction is `C₆H₆ + 3H₂ -> C₆H₁₂`, which fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Benzene (D = C6H6) and Cyclohexane (Z = C6H12).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**:\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons (containing C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (Cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons that can be saturated to form cyclohexane.\n    *   The transformation from X to Y is a disproportionation reaction.
