    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle moving in a conservative potential field is conserved. This total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy $E = \\gamma mc^2$ and its potential energy $U(x)$.\n    The relativistic energy $E$ can be further broken down into the rest energy $E_0 = mc^2$ and the kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$. So, $E = K + E_0$.\n    The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F = -kx$) is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the conserved total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the mass of the oscillator, $v$ is its speed, $c$ is the speed of light, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude**\n    The oscillator reaches its maximum speed at the equilibrium position and is momentarily at rest at its maximum amplitude.\n    Let the maximum amplitude be $x = A$. At this point, the speed of the mass is $v = 0$.\n    When $v = 0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position**\n    At the equilibrium position, the displacement is $x = 0$. At this point, the speed of the mass is maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equating the Energies and Solving for $v_{max}$**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, we can equate the expressions for the total energy at the maximum amplitude and at the equilibrium position:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ into this equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Then, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$ by multiplying by $c^2$ and taking the square root:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The derived expression for the maximum speed is $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$. This matches option A.\n\n    As a sanity check, in the non-relativistic limit ($\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$), we can use the binomial approximation $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$. Let $x = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\n    Then $(1+x)^{-2} \\approx 1-2x$.\n    $v_{max}^2 \\approx c^2(1 - (1-2x)) = c^2(2x) = c^2(2 \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}) = \\frac{kA^2}{m}$.\n    So, $v_{max} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, which is the correct classical result derived from $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. This confirms our relativistic formula is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>",

    "The problem asks for the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. We can solve this by applying the principle of conservation of total energy.\n\n**1. Define the Total Energy**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy ($E_{total}$) of a particle in a potential field $U(x)$ is the sum of its relativistic energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and its potential energy. For a harmonic oscillator with a spring constant $k$, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nTherefore, the total energy of the system is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $m$ is the rest mass of the oscillator.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $v$ is the instantaneous speed of the oscillator.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nSince the spring force is a conservative force, this total energy $E_{total}$ remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n**2. Analyze the Energy at Two Key Points**\n\nWe can find the value of this constant total energy by considering the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude), and then use this value to find the speed at another point.\n\n*   **At the maximum amplitude ($x=A$):**\n    The oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position ($x=0$):**\n    The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    The kinetic energy is maximum, which means the speed is at its maximum value, $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n**3.

    "The problem requires us to determine the maximum speed ($v_{max}$) of a mass in a relativistic harmonic oscillator system. The key principle to solve this problem is the **conservation of total energy**.\n\n**1. Formulation of Total Energy**\n\nIn a relativistic system, the total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n- The relativistic energy is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n- The potential energy of a spring system obeying Hooke's Law is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium.\n\nThus, the total conserved energy of the oscillator is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**2. Energy Conservation at Key Points**\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, its value is the same at every point in the oscillation. We can equate the total energy at two specific points: the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and the point of maximum speed (the equilibrium position).\n\n*   **At the point of maximum amplitude, $x=A$:**\n    The oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    When $v = 0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position, $x=0$:**\n    The potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$.\n    The oscillator has its maximum kinetic energy, which corresponds to its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n**3. Solving for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n\nBy the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n$\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n1.  First, isolate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n2.
