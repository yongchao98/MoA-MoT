    "This problem requires us to relate the temperatures of two stars based on the relative populations of an atomic energy level. The key physical principle is the Boltzmann distribution, which is applicable here because the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in an excited state *j* to the number in a lower state *i*:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N_j and N_i are the number densities of atoms in states *j* and *i*, respectively.\n*   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n*   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this problem, we are comparing the same two energy levels of iron in two different stars, so the states *i* and *j* and their properties (g_i, g_j, ΔE) are the same for both stars.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations for Star 1 and Star 2**\n\nLet's define the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state population for each star:\n*   For star_1 (temperature T_1):  (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n*   For star_2 (temperature T_2):  (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n**3. Using the Information from the Problem**\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the population ratio in star_1 is double the population ratio in star_2:\n\n(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relation:\n\n(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, (g_j / g_i), is the same on both sides, so it cancels out:\n\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n**4. Solving for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2**\n\nTo solve for T_1 and T_2, we can use logarithms. Let's take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\nln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b), we get:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 ] = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the brackets by finding a common denominator (T_1 * T_2):\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n**5. Using the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference: ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\nWe know the value of the Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio ΔE / k:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nThe problem is designed such that this constant factor is numerically equal to 1. Substituting this value into our derived equation:\n\n(1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n[ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\nThis equation matches option A. While option A as written is dimensionally inconsistent (dimensionless on the left, 1/temperature on the right), it is the correct algebraic form derived from the physics after applying the specific numerical values given in the problem, which make the dimension-carrying constant equal to one.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The key assumption is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation**, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms among their various energy levels at a specific temperature.\n\n**2. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (let's call it state *j*) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (state *i*):\n\nNⱼ / Nᵢ = (gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   Nⱼ and Nᵢ are the number of atoms in states *j* and *i*, respectively.\n*   gⱼ and gᵢ are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the two states. These are constants for a given pair of energy levels.\n*   ΔE = Eⱼ - Eᵢ is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**3. Apply the Equation to Both Stars**\n\nWe need to write the Boltzmann equation for each star, keeping in mind that we are considering the same energy transition in iron atoms for both. This means that ΔE, gⱼ, and gᵢ are the same for both stars.\n\n*   For star_1 (with temperature T₁):\n    (Nⱼ / Nᵢ)₁ = (gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\n*   For star_2 (with temperature T₂):\n    (Nⱼ / Nᵢ)₂ = (gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nThe term (Nⱼ / Nᵢ) represents the \"excitation level\" or the population ratio of the excited state relative to the lower state.\n\n**4. Use the Information Given in the Problem**\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This translates to:\n\n(Nⱼ / Nᵢ)₁ = 2 * (Nⱼ / Nᵢ)₂\n\n**5. Substitute and Solve**\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions from step 3 into the relationship from step 4:\n\n(gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [ (gⱼ / gᵢ) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, (gⱼ / gᵢ), is present on both sides and can be canceled out:\n\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nTo solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, ln(eˣ) = x and ln(a * b) = ln(a) + ln(b), we get:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate the ln(2) term:\n\nΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term, (ΔE / k):\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ 1/T₂ - 1/T₁ ] = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the brackets using the common denominator T₁*T₂:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\n**6. Use the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides two key values:\n*   Energy difference, ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nLet's calculate the value of the constant factor (ΔE / k):\n\n(ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\n(1 K) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem presents the final equations without units, implying this constant factor is simply 1. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nThis result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in an excited state (N₂) to the number of atoms in a lower state (N₁) by the formula:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂/N₁ is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the lower state.
