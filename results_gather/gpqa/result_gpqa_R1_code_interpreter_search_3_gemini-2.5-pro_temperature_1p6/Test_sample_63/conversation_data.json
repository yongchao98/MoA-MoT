    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental setup and identify the gaseous products.**\n\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposes completely into a gas mixture when heated. This gas mixture is passed through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   To find the moles of water, we use its molar mass (M(H₂O) ≈ 18.02 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂, etc. A reaction would cause a change in mass (e.g., by forming a precipitate like CaCO₃).\n    *   The problem states the weight of this tube did not change.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information: it means **no acidic gases** were present in the decomposition products.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   To find the moles of oxygen, we use its molar mass (M(O₂) ≈ 32.00 g/mol).\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   The gas that remains after passing through all three tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This indicates it's a relatively inert gas. Given the likely elements in the original salts (see below), this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify the Product Identification and Quantities**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the products we've identified:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis calculated mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g), confirming that our identification and quantification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) are correct.\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nSince the salts completely decompose into H₂O, O₂, and N₂, they must be composed solely of hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O → 0.20 × 2 = 0.40 mol H atoms.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ → 0.10 × 2 = 0.20 mol N atoms.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (0.20 × 1) + (0.025 × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O atoms.\n\nSo, the total elemental mole ratio in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25.\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20: H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of two salts (salt A and salt B). Since they contain only N, H, and O, the cation is likely ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions are oxygen-containing ions of nitrogen (oxyanions). The most common examples are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n\nLet's hypothesize:\n*   Salt A is **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   Salt B is **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nNow, let's see if an equimolar (1:1 mole ratio) mixture of these two salts matches our derived elemental ratio. We sum the atoms from one formula unit of each:\n*   Total N atoms = 2 (from A) + 2 (from B) = 4\n*   Total H atoms = 4 (from A) + 4 (from B) = 8\n*   Total O atoms = 3 (from A) + 2 (from B) = 5\n\nThe combined atomic ratio is N:H:O = 4:8:5. This exactly matches the ratio we calculated from the experimental products. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.",
    "**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a 7.20 g mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are analyzed by passing them through a series of chemical traps.\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Mixture of Salt A and Salt B.\n    *   Total Mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   The mixture is \"equimolar,\" meaning moles of A = moles of B.\n\n*   **Decomposition:**\n    *   Heating to 200°C completely decomposes the salts into a gas mixture.\n\n*   **Gas Analysis:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂). The mass did not change, which is a crucial clue: **no acidic gases were formed**.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of gas remains at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure). At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with the desiccant, the base, or the hot copper, indicating it is a relatively inert gas. Given that salt decomposition often produces nitrogen, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify the Products and Conservation of Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the identified products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total Mass of Products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass, confirming that H₂O, O₂, and N₂ are the only products.\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition and Identify the Salts**\n\nSince the products are composed only of Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen, the original salts A and B must also be composed of only these three elements. Such salts typically consist of the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and a nitrogen-oxygen anion (oxyanion).\n\nLet's determine the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture from the products:\n*   **Total Moles of H:** from 0.20 mol of H₂O → 0.20 mol × 2 = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Total Moles of N:** from 0.10 mol of N₂ → 0.10 mol × 2 = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Total Moles of O:** from 0.20 mol of H₂O + 0.025 mol of O₂ → (0.20 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\nThe empirical mole ratio of the elements in the entire mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To simplify this to integers, we can multiply by 20, which gives a ratio of **8 : 4 : 5**.\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar (1:1 mole ratio) of Salt A and Salt B, the sum of the atoms in their chemical formulas must match this 8:4:5 ratio. Let's test common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂): Formula N₂H₄O₂\n*   Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃): Formula N₂H₄O₃\n\nLet's assume Salt A is NH₄NO₃ and Salt B is NH₄NO₂. If we have one formula unit of each:\n*   Total H atoms = 4 (from A) + 4 (from B) = **8**\n*   Total N atoms = 2 (from A) + 2 (from B) = **4**\n*   Total O atoms = 3 (from A) + 2 (from B) = **5**\n\nThe combined elemental ratio is H:N:O = 8:4:5, which perfectly matches our findings. Therefore, the salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n**Total Atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem states a 7.20 g mixture of salts decomposes completely into a gas mixture. This mixture is passed through a series of tubes, and the changes in mass tell us what the gaseous products were.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is the mass of water produced: **Mass H₂O = 3.60 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂.\n    *   The problem states the weight of this tube **did not change**. This is a crucial clue: **no acidic gases** were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) in the gas stream (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO).\n    *   The mass increase is the mass of oxygen that reacted: **Mass O₂ = 0.80 g**.\n    *   The molar mass of O₂ is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   The gas that doesn't react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol Gas C**.\n    *   Since this gas is inert to water absorption, a basic solution, and hot copper, and because the original materials are nitrogen-containing salts, Gas C is almost certainly **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n\n**2. Verify Conservation of Mass**\n\nLet's check if the masses of our identified products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) add up to the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015 # g/mol\nM_O2 = 31.998 # g/mol\nM_N2 = 28.014 # g/mol\n\n# Moles calculated from the problem statement\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = 0.80 / M_O2\nmoles_N2 = 2.24 / 22.4\n\n# Calculate mass of N2\nmass_N2 = moles_N2 * M_N2\n\n# Calculate total mass of products\ntotal_mass_products = 3.60 + 0.80 + mass_N2\n\nprint(f\"Total mass of products: {total_mass_products:.2f} g\")\n```\n<execute_python>\nTotal mass of products: 7.20 g\n</execute_python>\nThe calculated total mass of the products is 7.20 g, which perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms our identification of the products and their quantities is correct.\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition**\n\nThe products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts A and B could only contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the original mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** Found only in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    Moles H = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** Found only in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    Moles N = 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Found in H₂O and O₂.\n    Moles O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\nThe empirical mole ratio for the entire mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all numbers by 20, which gives **H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5**.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. Common examples are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions. The problem states it's an **equimolar mixture** (moles of A = moles of B). We are looking for two salts whose formulas, when added together, give the elemental ratio H:N:O = 8:4:5.\n\nLet's test the most likely candidates:\n*   Salt A: **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   Salt B: **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nLet's combine one formula unit of each:\n*   Total N atoms = 2 (from A) + 2 (from B) = **4**\n*   Total H atoms = 4 (from A) + 4 (from B) = **8**\n*   Total O atoms = 3 (from A) + 2 (from B) = **5**\n\nThe combined atomic ratio is N:H:O = 4:8:5. This is an exact match with the ratio derived from the experimental data. Therefore, the two salts are Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonium Nitrite.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means summing the atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   Number of atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Number of atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Products and Calculate Their Moles**\n\nThe problem describes the complete decomposition of a 7.20 g salt mixture into gases. We can identify these gases and their amounts from how they interact with the chemical traps.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases.\n    *   The mass did not change, which means **no acidic gases** (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas.\n    *   Mass of O₂ that reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The gas that passed through all tubes had a volume of 2.24 L at STP.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This gas is inert to the traps. Since the original salts must contain nitrogen (as they are salts), this gas is **Nitrogen (N₂) **.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nThe products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) tell us that the original salts A and B were composed only of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. We can calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n**3.

We can calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H:** from 0.20 mol of H₂O → 0.20 mol × 2 = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Total Moles of N:** from 0.10 mol of N₂ → 0.10 mol × 2 = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Total Moles of O:** from 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (0.20 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\nThe mole ratio of elements in the entire mixture is H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20, resulting in **H:N:O = 8:4:5**.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states it's an **equimolar mixture**, meaning there are equal moles of Salt A and Salt B. Therefore, the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B must correspond to the ratio H₈N₄O₅. Common salts containing H, N, and O are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids. Let's test the most likely candidates:\n\n*   Salt A: **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   Salt B: **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's sum the atoms from one formula unit of each hypothesized salt:\n*   Total H atoms = 4 (from A) + 4 (from B) = **8**\n*   Total N atoms = 2 (from A) + 2 (from B) = **4**\n*   Total O atoms = 3 (from A) + 2 (from B) = **5**\n\nThe combined atomic count is N₄H₈O₅, which perfectly matches our experimentally derived ratio. Therefore, the salts are indeed Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonium Nitrite.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means we sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of each of our identified salts.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
