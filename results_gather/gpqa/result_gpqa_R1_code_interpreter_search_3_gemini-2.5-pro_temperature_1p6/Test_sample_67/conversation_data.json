    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a vector in a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space.\n*   The magnetic moment **μ** is related to the spin operator **S** by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem states `mu (= gamma*Sz)`, which is likely a shorthand for the z-component, but the physics of the interaction with a vector magnetic field implies the vector relation **μ** = γ**S**.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is **B**_initial = B **k**, pointing in the +Z direction.\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is H₀ = -**μ** · **B**_initial = -γ**S** · (B **k**) = -γBS_z.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate where its magnetic moment points in the same direction as the magnetic field (+Z direction). The operator for the z-component of the magnetic moment is μ_z = γS_z. For μ_z to be positive, the expectation value of S_z must be positive.\n*   The eigenstates of S_z are spin-up |+z⟩ (or |↑⟩) and spin-down |-z⟩ (or |↓⟩), with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.\n*   To have a positive magnetic moment in the z-direction, the particle must be in the spin-up state, |+z⟩.\n*   So, the state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B**_new = B **j**, pointing in the +Y direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for t > 0 is H = -**μ** · **B**_new = -γ**S** · (B **j**) = -γBS_y.\n*   According to the \"sudden approximation\" in quantum mechanics, the state of the system does not change instantaneously. So, the state at the moment just after the switch (t=0⁺) is still the same as the state just before: |ψ(t=0⁺)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System (t > 0)\n\nThe state of the system will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian H. We want to find the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩. Since ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩, we need to find the time evolution of ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n\nThere are a few ways to solve this. A very direct and physical method is to use the concept of energy eigenstates.\n\n### Method: Using Energy Eigenstates\n\n1.  **Find the energy eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian.**\n    The new Hamiltonian is H = -γBS_y. The energy eigenvalues are determined by the eigenvalues of the spin operator S_y. The eigenvalues of any spin component operator (S_x, S_y, or S_z) for a spin-1/2 particle are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    The energy eigenvalues are therefore:\n    E₁ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2\n    E₂ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2\n\n2.  **Relate energy difference to oscillation frequency.**\n    When a quantum system is in a superposition of two energy eigenstates E₁ and E₂, any observable that is not diagonal in this energy basis will oscillate with an angular frequency ω given by the energy difference:\n    ω = |E₂ - E₁| / ħ\n    In our case:\n    ΔE = |E₂ - E₁| = |(γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2)| = |γBħ|\n    So, the oscillation frequency is:\n    ω = |γBħ| / ħ = |γ|B\n\n3.  **Check for superposition.**\n    This oscillation only occurs if the initial state is a superposition of the new energy eigenstates. The new energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y, which we denote as |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.\n    The initial state is |+z⟩. We need to express |+z⟩ in the S_y basis. The relationship between the S_z basis ({|+z⟩, |-z⟩}) and the S_y basis ({|+y⟩, |-y⟩}) is:\n    |+y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩)\n    |-y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)\n    Solving for |+z⟩, we get:\n    |+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)\n    Since the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ is an equal superposition of the two new energy eigenstates, |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, the system will indeed exhibit oscillations.\n\n4.  **Final Result for Frequency.**\n    The angular frequency of oscillation is ω = |γ|B. The options are given in terms of γ, not |γ|, which is common in problems where γ is treated as a positive constant. Assuming γ > 0, the frequency is:\n    ω = γB\n\nThis frequency is known as the **Larmor frequency**. It describes the precession of the spin's expectation value around the new magnetic field direction. The vector ⟨**S**⟩ rotates around the Y-axis, so its z-component, ⟨S_z⟩, oscillates sinusoidally.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩, oscillates with an angular frequency ω = γB.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state is described by a spinor vector.\n*   The magnetic moment operator is given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator vector.\n*   The Hamiltonian of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field **B** is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is **B**_initial = B**k** (pointing in the +Z direction). The Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**k**) = -γBS_z.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of H_initial. The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are E = -γB(±ħ/2). For the magnetic moment to be aligned with the field, the energy must be minimized. Assuming γ > 0 (which is standard for particles like the proton; for the electron γ < 0, but the physics is analogous), the lowest energy state corresponds to the spin being aligned with the field, i.e., the state with the highest positive eigenvalue for S_z.\n*   This is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as |+z⟩ or |↑⟩.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B**_new = B**j** (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t > 0 is H = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**j**) = -γBS_y.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution (t > 0)\n\nThe state of the system |ψ(t)⟩ for t > 0 is found by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. A standard way to do this is to express the initial state in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates.\n\n1.  **Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian:** The new Hamiltonian is H = -γBS_y. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of the S_y operator. Let's call them |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. Their eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of H are:\n        *   E₊ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2 (for eigenstate |+y⟩)\n        *   E₋ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2 (for eigenstate |-y⟩)\n\n2.  **Express Initial State in New Basis:** The initial state is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. We need to write this state as a superposition of the S_y eigenstates, |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. The relationship between the z-basis and y-basis states is:\n    *   |+y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩)\n    *   |-y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)\n    *   By adding these two equations, we can express |+z⟩:\n        |+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)\n\n3.  **Evolve the State in Time:** The time evolution of the state is given by:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e⁻ⁱᴴᵗ/ħ |ψ(0)⟩\n    Substituting the superposition for |ψ(0)⟩:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [e⁻ⁱᴴᵗ/ħ |+y⟩ + e⁻ⁱᴴᵗ/ħ |-y⟩]\n    Since |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are energy eigenstates with energies E₊ and E₋:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [e⁻ⁱᴱ₊ᵗ/ħ |+y⟩ + e⁻ⁱᴱ₋ᵗ/ħ |-y⟩]\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [e⁻ⁱ(-γBħ/2)ᵗ/ħ |+y⟩ + e⁻ⁱ(γBħ/2)ᵗ/ħ |-y⟩]\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [eⁱ(γB/2)ᵗ |+y⟩ + e⁻ⁱ(γB/2)ᵗ |-y⟩]\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:** We need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩. Let's first calculate ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n    It is easiest to switch back to the z-basis:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [eⁱ(γB/2)ᵗ * (1/√2)(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) + e⁻ⁱ(γB/2)ᵗ * (1/√2)(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)]\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ (eⁱ(γB/2)ᵗ + e⁻ⁱ(γB/2)ᵗ})|+z⟩ + i(eⁱ(γB/2)ᵗ - e⁻ⁱ(γB/2)ᵗ)|-z⟩ ]\n    Using Euler's formulas, cos(x) = (eⁱˣ+e⁻ⁱˣ)/2 and sin(x) = (eⁱˣ-e⁻ⁱˣ)/(2i):\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ 2cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + i(2isin(γBt/2))|-z⟩ ]\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩\n\n    Now we can compute ⟨S_z(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩\n    = [cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|] S_z [cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩]\n    Since S_z|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩ and S_z|-z⟩ = -(ħ/2)|-z⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = [cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|] [(ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩]\n    Using the orthogonality of the basis (⟨+z|+z⟩ = 1, ⟨-z|-z⟩ = 1, ⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0):\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos²(γBt/2) - (ħ/2)sin²(γBt/2)\n    Using the double-angle trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ):\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)\n    This expression describes an oscillation with an angular frequency ω. Comparing with the standard form Acos(ωt + φ), we can identify the angular frequency as:\n    ω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector ⟨**S**⟩ precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency ω = γB. As the vector precesses, its z-component oscillates.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "The problem describes a classic quantum mechanics scenario known as Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the physics involved to determine the oscillation frequency.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State (t < 0)\n1.  **System:** We have a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described in a 2D Hilbert space with basis states corresponding to spin-up and spin-down.\n2.  **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment operator **μ** is proportional to the spin operator **S**, given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n3.  **Hamiltonian:** The interaction energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**.\n4.  **Initial Field:** Initially, the magnetic field is **B**_initial = B**k**, pointing in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**k**) = -γBS_z.\n5.  **Initial State:** The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the eigenstate of the S_z operator where its spin points along the positive Z-axis. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The \"aligned\" state is the spin-up state, denoted as |+z⟩ or |↑⟩, which corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Change and Subsequent Evolution (t ≥ 0)\n1.  **New Field:** At t=0, the magnetic field is abruptly switched to **B**_new = B**j**, pointing in the +Y direction.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian governing the time evolution for t > 0 is now H = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**j**) = -γBS_y.\n3.  **Time Evolution:** According to the sudden approximation, the state of the system does not change instantaneously. Thus, the state at t=0⁺ is still |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. This state will then evolve according to the new Hamiltonian H. The time evolution of any observable will depend on the energy difference between the eigenstates of this new Hamiltonian.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThere is a very direct method to find the frequency without performing a full time-evolution calculation.\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian:** The new Hamiltonian is H = -γBS_y.

For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of any spin component operator (like S_y) are always +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n2.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n    *   E₁ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2\n    *   E₂ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2\n3.  **Frequency and Energy Difference:** When a quantum system's initial state is a superposition of two energy eigenstates with energies E₁ and E₂, any observable that is not diagonal in the energy basis will oscillate with an angular frequency (ω) given by the difference in energy:\n    ω = |E₂ - E₁| / ħ\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The energy difference is ΔE = |E₂ - E₁| = |(+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2)| = |γBħ|.\n    *   The oscillation frequency is ω = ΔE / ħ = |γBħ| / ħ = |γ|B.\n5.  **Condition Check:** This oscillation occurs because the initial state, |+z⟩, is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian (whose eigenstates are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩). In fact, |+z⟩ can be written as an equal superposition of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩: |+z⟩ = (1/√2)(|+y⟩ + |-y⟩). Since the initial state is a superposition of the new energy eigenstates, the system will exhibit oscillations at the frequency derived above.\n\nAssuming γ and B are positive constants, the oscillation frequency is **ω = γB**.

Its eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of the spin operator S_y, which we denote as |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues of S_y are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues are E = -γB(eigenvalue of S_y).\n        *   For state |+y⟩, the energy is E₊ = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2.\n        *   For state |-y⟩, the energy is E₋ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2.\n\n2.  **Frequency from Energy Difference:** A key principle in quantum dynamics is that if a system is in a superposition of two energy states E₁ and E₂, it will evolve with a characteristic angular frequency ω given by the energy difference:\n    ω = |E₂ - E₁| / ħ\n    In our case, the energy difference is:\n    ΔE = |E₋ - E₊| = |(γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2)| = |γBħ|\n    The oscillation frequency is therefore:\n    ω = ΔE / ħ = |γBħ| / ħ = |γ|B\n\n3.  **Confirming Oscillation:** This oscillation will occur only if the initial state |+z⟩ is a superposition of the new energy eigenstates (|+y⟩ and |-y⟩). The relationship between the z-basis and y-basis is:\n    |+z⟩ = (1/√2)(|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)\n    Since the initial state is indeed a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the expectation value of S_z (which is not diagonal in the y-basis) will oscillate.\n\n4.  **Final Result:** Assuming γ and B are positive quantities as is typical in such problems, the oscillation frequency is **ω = γB**. This is a well-known result called the **Larmor frequency**, which describes the precession of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field. As the expectation value of the spin vector ⟨**S**⟩ precesses around the new magnetic field axis (Y-axis), its projection onto the Z-axis, ⟨S_z⟩, oscillates sinusoidally with this frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct answer is γB.\n\n<<<B>>>"
