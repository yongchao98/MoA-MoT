    "This problem requires us to calculate the distribution of cobalt species in a solution containing a known concentration of thiocyanate ions. We need to find the percentage of the specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II), which is `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n\n**1. Define the System**\n\nThe formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺  ; β₁ = `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])` = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]  ; β₂ = `[[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) ` = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻  ; β₃ = `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) ` = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)` = 16\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given as `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M.\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nThe thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`, is given as 0.1 M. Since the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is significantly lower than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M), the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small. Thus, we can safely assume the equilibrium concentration of free thiocyanate ions is approximately equal to its initial concentration, `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Fraction of Each Species**\n\nThe fraction (αₙ) of any given complex `[Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants βₙ.\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe fraction of the desired dithiocyanato complex, `α₂`, is:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a general formula for the fraction of any species that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe will now substitute the given values into this formula to find `α₂`.\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a Python script is used.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator is the term for the Co(SCN)2 complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of terms for all species (including free Co2+, where beta0=1)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9%\n<<<\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction `α₂` is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9% of the total cobalt species.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "This problem requires calculating the distribution of cobalt species in a solution. Specifically, we need to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\nThe formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes from the free cobalt ion `Co²⁺` and the thiocyanate ligand `SCN⁻` is described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`  ;  `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` ;  `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻` ;  `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`;  `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free ion and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex. This is its fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100. The fraction is defined as:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants βₙ:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\nFactoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, let's substitute these expressions into the formula for the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term conveniently cancels out, leaving:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`) is much smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration (`[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M). This means that only a small fraction of the thiocyanate will be used to form complexes, so we can approximate the free equilibrium concentration of `[SCN⁻]` as its total concentration, which is 0.1 M.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula for `α₂`. A Python script is a reliable way to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the alpha2 fraction\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms)\n# The terms are: 1 (for free Co2+), beta1*[SCN-], beta2*[SCN-]^2, etc.\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of dithiocyanato cobalt(II) is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n\n```\n>>>\nThe percentage of dithiocyanato cobalt(II) is: 16.9%\n<<<\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 0.169, or 16.9%. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
