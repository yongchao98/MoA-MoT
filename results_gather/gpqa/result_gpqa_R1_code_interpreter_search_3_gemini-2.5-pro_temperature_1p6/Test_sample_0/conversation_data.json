    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt).\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n*   **Lifetime and Energy Width:** For a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ), this lifetime can be considered as the time uncertainty (Δt = τ). This means the energy level is not perfectly sharp but has an intrinsic energy width, or uncertainty, often denoted by Γ (Gamma). So, the relationship is Γ ≈ ħ/τ.\n*   **Calculating Energy Widths:** We need to calculate the energy width for each of the two states.\n    *   For the first state: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s. Its energy width is Γ₁ = ħ / τ₁.\n    *   For the second state: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. Its energy width is Γ₂ = ħ / τ₂.\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths: |E₁ - E₂| > Γ₁ + Γ₂. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, which is the primary factor limiting resolution.\n*   **Calculation:** Let's calculate the required energy difference and compare it with the given options.\n\nI will now use Python to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9  # sec\ntau2 = 1e-8  # sec\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state using the formula Gamma = hbar / tau\ngamma1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ngamma2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the widths.\n# The total width can be considered Gamma_total = gamma1 + gamma2.\n# So, the energy difference must be greater than Gamma_total.\nmin_energy_difference_eV = gamma1 + gamma2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (Gamma1): {gamma1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (Gamma2): {gamma2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required minimum energy difference |E1 - E2| must be > (Gamma1 + Gamma2) = {min_energy_difference_eV:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Given options\noption_A = 1e-9\noption_B = 1e-4\noption_C = 1e-11\noption_D = 1e-8\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nprint(f\"Option A (1e-9 eV): Is it greater than {min_energy_difference_eV:.4e} eV? {'Yes' if option_A > min_energy_difference_eV else 'No'}\")\nprint(f\"Option B (1e-4 eV): Is it greater than {min_energy_difference_eV:.4e} eV? {'Yes' if option_B > min_energy_difference_eV else 'No'}\")\nprint(f\"Option C (1e-11 eV): Is it greater than {min_energy_difference_eV:.4e} eV? {'Yes' if option_C > min_energy_difference_eV else 'No'}\")\nprint(f\"Option D (1e-8 eV): Is it greater than {min_energy_difference_eV:.4e} eV? {'Yes' if option_D > min_energy_difference_eV else 'No'}\")\n```\n**2.
