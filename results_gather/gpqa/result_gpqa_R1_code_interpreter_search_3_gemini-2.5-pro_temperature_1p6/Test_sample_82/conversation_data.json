    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during a weak acid-strong base titration.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Conditions and Dilution**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\nInitial concentration of acetic acid (C1) = 0.05 M\nInitial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm3 = 0.020 L\nVolume of water added = 20.00 cm3 = 0.020 L\nFinal volume of the diluted solution (V2) = V1 + V_water = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 0.040 L\n\nThe number of moles of acetic acid remains the same after dilution:\nMoles of CH3COOH = C1 * V1 = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol\n\nThe new concentration of the diluted acetic acid (C2) is:\nC2 = Moles / V2 = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm3 of 0.025 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\nThe titration reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COONa + H2O\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH3COOH) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. The solution at this point is a buffer, containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\npH = pKa + log([CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\nKa = 1.85 x 10^-5\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.73\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n[CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\nNow, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\npH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The number of moles of NaOH added is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol).\n\nFirst, find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (Veq):\nVeq = Moles of acid / Concentration of NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm3\n\nNext, calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\nTotal Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L\n\nNow, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH3COO-) in the solution. The moles of acetate are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n[CH3COO-] = Moles of acetate / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nAt the equivalence point, the acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\nCH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of OH-. We use the Kb for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.405 x 10^-10\n\nWe set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]\n\nLet x = [OH-] = [CH3COOH]. We can approximate [CH3COO-] as its initial concentration, 0.02 M.\nKb ≈ x^2 / 0.02\nx^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405 x 10^-10) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10^-11\nx = [OH-] = √(1.081 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.288 x 10^-6 M\n\nNow, calculate pOH:\npOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.288 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.483\n\nFinally, calculate pH (at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14):\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1e-14\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05  # M\ninitial_acid_vol = 0.020  # L\ndilution_water_vol = 0.020 # L\nnaoh_conc = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\n# Calculate moles of acid\nmoles_acid = initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol\n# Calculate concentration of diluted acid\ndiluted_acid_vol = initial_acid_vol + dilution_water_vol\ndiluted_acid_conc = moles_acid / diluted_acid_vol\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# pKa = -log10(Ka)\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\n# pH = pKa + log10(ratio)\nph_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point\nV_eq = moles_acid / naoh_conc\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_eq = diluted_acid_vol + V_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus_eq = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n# Kb = Kw / Ka\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-]^2 / [A-] = Kb  =>  [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# Assume x << [A-], where x = [OH-]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_eq)\n# pOH = -log10([OH-])\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n# pH = 14 - pOH\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {ph_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n<<<A>>>",

This means 75% of the acid remains unreacted. The resulting solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base] to [acid] is the same as the ratio of their moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the pH:\npH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3)\npH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate, which hydrolyzes in water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo calculate the pH, we first need the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point.\n*   Initial moles of acid = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence = moles_acid / concentration_NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Total volume at equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Concentration of acetate, [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nNext, we need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow we can set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻] concentration (let it be 'x'):\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\nx² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow calculate pOH:\npOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n\nFinally, calculate the pH:\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are 4.26 for 25% titration and 8.52 for the equivalence point, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
