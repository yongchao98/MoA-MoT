    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H bond stretch that is undergoing significant hydrogen bonding. The very broad nature strongly suggests the O-H of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. The presence of both this peak and the broad O-H peak is very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key fragment. Let's calculate its composition. The most common and stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio is the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragment is formed by cleavage of the bond next to the carboxyl group and is a definitive piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From the FTIR and Mass Spec, we have confirmed the presence of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group. A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   From the FTIR and 1H NMR, we have confirmed the presence of an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    We need to choose between the remaining options, C (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2), by calculating their Degrees of Unsaturation. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   The structural features we've identified require a certain DoU:\n        *   One C=O bond (in the carboxylic acid) accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C bond (in the alkene) accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For C (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n        *   **For D (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which would not have the C=C bond indicated by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that accommodates all the spectroscopic evidence (a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and a total DoU of 2) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the molecular formula of an unknown compound from a list of options.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer, where extensive hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be extremely broad.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak and a C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is very strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates an **alkene (C=C)** functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum confirms the existence of an **alkene** functional group, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group, -COOH.\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45.02\n    *   The fragment with m/z = 45 is the characteristic [COOH]⁺ ion, which provides definitive confirmation of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From all three techniques, we have confirmed the presence of two functional groups: a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** and an **alkene (C=C)**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This information allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C₆H₁₂O) and B (C₆H₁₀O), as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **C) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **D) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula for a compound CₓHᵧO₂ is: DoU = x - (y/2) + 1.\n    *   Our identified functional groups require a certain DoU:\n        *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **1** degree of unsaturation.\n        *   The C=C bond in the alkene accounts for **1** degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the total DoU of the molecule must be at least 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n            DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n        *   **For D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n            DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n    *   The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ has a DoU of 2, which perfectly matches the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n    *   The formula C₆H₁₂O₂ has a DoU of 1, which can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for an alkene.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic data (presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and a total degree of unsaturation of 2) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\n*   **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is the hallmark of an O-H bond stretch within a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n*   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of the very broad O-H peak and the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ provides very strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates an **alkene (C=C)** functional group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an **alkene**, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key diagnostic fragment. Let's determine its composition. The most common and stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio is the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass calculation: (1 × mass of Carbon) + (2 × mass of Oxygen) + (1 × mass of Hydrogen) = 12 + (2 × 16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** The presence of this fragment is definitive proof of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options\n\n1.  **Identify Required Features:** Based on the analysis, the unknown molecule must contain:\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   An alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Eliminate Options:** The requirement of two oxygen atoms immediately eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and B (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C (C₆H₁₀O₂) and D (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n\n3.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. The formula is:\n    DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules with C, H, and O)\n\n    The functional groups we identified require a certain DoU:\n    *   One C=O bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C bond (in the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the total required DoU for our molecule is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n        DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirements for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n    *   **For D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n        DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which would not have the C=C bond indicated by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that is consistent with all the provided evidence: the presence of a carboxylic acid (two oxygens, DoU=1), an alkene (DoU=1), and a total degree of unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
