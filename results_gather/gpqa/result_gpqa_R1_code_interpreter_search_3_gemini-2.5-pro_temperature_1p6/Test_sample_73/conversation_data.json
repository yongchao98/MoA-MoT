    "This is a problem about the probability of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless\".\n\n**1. Understand the Model of Radioactive Decay**\n\nThe probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (i.e., it survives past `t`) is given by the survival function:\n`P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that an atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n`P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nTo find `λ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n**3. Set up the Conditional Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability.\n\n*   Let A be the event that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 minutes (the next 150 minutes).\n*   Let B be the event that the atom has survived past t=50 minutes.\n\nWe want to find `P(A | B)`.\n\n**4. The \"Memoryless\" Property**\n\nA crucial feature of exponential decay is that it is memoryless. This means the probability of decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\nTherefore, the question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe calculate the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `λ` we found in Step 2:\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-(-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)`\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^((ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)`\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))`\n\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\nWe can now compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%\n# P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.32\n# This means exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# We want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes,\n# given it survived 50 minutes.

    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics and Mathematics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process. The probability of decay for a single atom doesn't change over time. This is a key concept known as the **memoryless property**. The fact that an atom has survived for a certain amount of time does not make it \"older\" or \"more likely to decay\" in the next instant. Its probability of decay in any given future interval is constant.\n\nThe time until decay, `T`, follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the atom survives past a time `t` is given by the survival function:\n`P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a positive number that characterizes how quickly the substance decays.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays *by* time `t` is therefore:\n`P(T ≤ t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Characterize the Decay**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\nWe can write this as:\n`P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n\nUsing our formula from step 1:\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nNow, let's find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n`e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `0.68`, represents the probability that the atom survives for 100 minutes. We don't need to calculate the exact value of `λ`; this relationship is sufficient.\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause of the memoryless property, the fact that it has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The question simplifies to: **\"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"**\n\n**4. Calculate the Desired Probability**\n\nWe need to find `P(T ≤ 150)`. Using the formula again:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nOur goal is to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)`. We can relate this to the value we found in step 2, `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`, using a property of exponents: `x^(a*b) = (x^a)^b`.\n\n`e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nNow we substitute the known value:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThis is the probability that the atom will *survive* for 150 minutes. The probability that it will *decay* within 150 minutes is:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**5. Compute the Final Result**\n\nWe can now compute this value using a calculator or a short script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# P_survival_100 = 0.68\n\n# We want to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes.\n# This is 1 minus the probability of survival for 150 minutes.\n# P_decay_150 = 1 - P_survival_150\n\n# P_survival_150 = (P_survival_100)^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5\nprob_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay within 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival probability.\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\nprint(prob_decay_150)\n\n```\n```output\n0.44023773177708575\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.4402, or 44.02%.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 40%\nB) 52%\nC) 44%\nD) 48%\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay**\n\nThe process of a single atom decaying is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and is inherently probabilistic. A key feature of this process is that it is **\"memoryless\"**. This means the atom's probability of decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes doesn't make it \"older\" or any more or less likely to decay in the next minute compared to a brand new atom.\n\n**2. Simplify the Problem Using the Memoryless Property**\n\nBecause of the memoryless property, the question:\n\"Given that the atom has survived for 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"\nis equivalent to the much simpler question:\n\"What is the probability that a new atom will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n**3. Set up the Mathematical Model**\n\nThe probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (its survival probability) is given by an exponential function:\n`P(survival_t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant for this specific type of atom.\n\nConsequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n`P(decay_t) = 1 - P(survival_t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom**\n\nWe are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find a key value for our calculation.\n\n`P(decay_100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n`P(survival_100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `0.68`, represents the probability of this atom surviving a 100-minute period. We don't need to find `λ` itself.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval (150 minutes)**\n\nWe need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(decay_150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\nWe can use the survival probability we found in the previous step. Using the properties of exponents:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value we found for the survival probability over 100 minutes:\n`P(survival_150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe final step is to calculate this value and find the corresponding decay probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the survival probability for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# P_survival_100 = 0.68\n\n# Due to the memoryless property, we need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval.\n# First, let's find the survival probability for 150 minutes.\n# P_survival_150 = (P_survival_100)^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5\nprob_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay within 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival probability.\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in 150 minutes is: {prob_decay_150}\")\n```\n```output\nThe probability of decay in 150 minutes is: 0.44023773177708575\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately `0.4402`, which is 44.02%.

    "This is a problem about the probability of radioactive decay, which is governed by the exponential distribution. The most important characteristic of this process for solving this problem is that it is **memoryless**.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Memoryless Property:** The memoryless property of radioactive decay means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the future. Therefore, the problem simplifies from \"What is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" to the much simpler \"What is the probability a new atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n2.  **Define the Probabilities:**\n    *   The probability of an atom *surviving* past time `t` is `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of an atom *decaying by* time `t` is `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    `P(T ≤ 100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    `P(T > 100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Desired Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n    `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    We can find `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the value we found in the previous step and the properties of exponents:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the known survival probability for 100 minutes:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    This is the probability of survival for 150 minutes.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principle: Memoryless Decay**\nThe cornerstone of solving this problem is understanding that radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means that an atom's probability of decaying in a future interval of time is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes gives us no information about its likelihood to decay in the next minute, hour, or day. It's not like a machine part that wears out over time. At any given moment, the atom is in the same \"state\" with the same probability of decay.\n\nTherefore, the question:\n*\"So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"*\nis equivalent to the simpler question:\n*\"What is the probability that a freshly obtained atom will decay within 150 minutes?\"*\n\n**2. Set up the Mathematical Model**\nThe probability of decay is described by an exponential function. Let's denote the probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` as `P_survival(t)`. This is given by:\n`P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n\nThe probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is then:\n`P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find a key parameter of our model.\n`P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this equation, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n`P_survival(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis tells us there is a 68% chance for the atom to survive any 100-minute period. We don't need to find `λ` explicitly; this relationship is all we need.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability for the Required Time Interval**\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay within 150 minutes, `P_decay(150)`.\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nWe can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using our result from step 3 and the properties of exponents:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value we found for `P_survival(100)`:\n`P_survival(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**5. Compute the Final Result**\nThe probability of decay within 150 minutes is `1` minus the probability of survival for 150 minutes.\n\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nWe can now compute this with a simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 0.32.\n# This implies the survival probability for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\np_survival_100 = 0.68\n\n# The memoryless property means we want to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\n# First, we find the survival probability for 150 minutes.\n# This can be calculated from the 100-minute survival probability.\n# p_survival_150 = (p_survival_100)^(150/100)\np_survival_150 = p_survival_100 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival.\np_decay_150 = 1 - p_survival_150\n\nprint(p_decay_150)\n```\n```output\n0.44023773177708575\n```\nThe result is approximately 0.4402, which corresponds to a 44.02% probability.
