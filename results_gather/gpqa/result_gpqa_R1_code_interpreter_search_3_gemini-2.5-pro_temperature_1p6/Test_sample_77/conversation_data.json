    "This problem asks for the scalar potential $V$ and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n*   A point charge $q$ is moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   Its velocity at any time $t'$ is $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}(t')/dt'$.\n*   We want to find the potentials at a specific field point $\\vec{r}$ at a specific time $t$.\n*   Due to the finite speed of light, $c$, the electromagnetic field experienced at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$.\n*   The position of the charge at this retarded time was $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The information (the field) traveled from $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to $\\vec{r}$ in a time interval $t - t_r$. The distance it traveled is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   Therefore, the retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the equation:\n    $c(t - t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n\n### 2. Defining the Vectors\nThe problem defines several vectors:\n*   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the field point $\\vec{r}$.\n    $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\nUsing these definitions, the retarded time condition can be written as $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Potentials (Conceptual)\nThe general solutions for the potentials from a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the **retarded potentials**:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving on trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ in the argument of the densities depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation of the integral (which can be found in standard electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' or Jackson's) involves accounting for the \"compression\" of the charge's apparent volume due to its motion. This evaluation leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$\\int \\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r) d^3r' \\rightarrow \\left[ \\frac{q}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nwhere the subscript \"ret\" indicates all quantities in the bracket ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 4. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nUsing this result, we can write down the potentials.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d} \\left[ \\frac{q}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\nThe calculation for the vector potential is analogous. The source is now $q\\vec{v}$ instead of just $q$.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{1}{d} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe term $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of retardation. The sign is negative, leading to a larger potential when the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), analogous to the Doppler effect.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\nLet's compare our derived results with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$:** Incorrect. This is the static potential, ignoring retardation.\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$:** Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong.\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$:** Correct. This matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly.\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$:** Incorrect. The scalar potential is the static form. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is actually true for the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for $V$ here is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the scalar potential $V$ and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at a point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, generated by a point charge $q$ moving on a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. These are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n### 1. Key Concepts\n*   **Retarded Time:** Due to the finite speed of light, $c$, the electromagnetic field observed at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$.\n*   The time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is $t-t_r$.\n*   The distance this field travels is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   Therefore, the retarded time $t_r$ is implicitly defined by the equation:\n    $c(t - t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n\n### 2. Notation from the Problem\nThe problem provides a specific notation which we must use:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the source's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the source's retarded position to the observation point.\n\nUsing this notation, the retarded time condition becomes $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Potentials\nThe potentials for a time-varying charge distribution are given by the retarded potential formulas. For a point charge, these integrals evaluate to:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d'} \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d'} \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\n\nThe term \"retarded\" means all quantities related to the source ($d'$, $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. However, a crucial point is that the effective distance, $d'$, is not simply the geometric distance $d$. Due to the motion of the source, the volume element of the charge appears compressed or expanded from the observer's point of view. This relativistic effect introduces a correction factor.\n\nThe correct evaluation of the integrals for a point charge yields:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nwhere $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\nLet's rewrite these expressions using the given notation:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = d(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this into the potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\nNow we compare these derived results with the given choices:\n*   A) Incorrect. These are static-like potentials that do not account for retardation effects.\n*   B) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive (`+`). The correct sign is negative (`-`), which accounts for the \"bunching up\" of the field lines when the charge moves toward the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), leading to a stronger potential.\n*   **C) Correct.** The expressions for both $V$ and $\\vec{A}$ exactly match the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   D) Incorrect. The expression for $V$ is the static potential. Although the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the true Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the given $V$ is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct formulas for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The derivation of these potentials is a standard topic in classical electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Identify the Retarded Potentials\nFor a localized, time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$, the general solutions for the scalar potential $V$ and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time, which signifies that the field at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ is determined by the state of the source at an earlier time $t_r$.\n\n### 2. Specialize for a Moving Point Charge\nFor a single point charge $q$ moving on a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are given by:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas is not trivial because the delta function's argument contains the retarded time, which itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation of the integral (often done using the property $\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$ where $g(x_i)=0$) leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n\n### 3. State the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe result of this integration gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Using the notation provided in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThe denominator term, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, accounts for the relativistic effect of retardation. The dot product $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ being positive means the charge is moving somewhat towards the observer, causing the potential to be larger, analogous to a Doppler effect. The minus sign is crucial.\n\n### 4. Match with the Given Options\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator of our expressions by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nNow let's compare these with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect. These are static or quasi-static potentials and ignore the full retardation effect.\n*   B) Incorrect. The denominator has $(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. The sign is wrong.\n*   **C) Correct.** These expressions exactly match our derived formulas for both $V$ and $\\vec{A}$.\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   D) Incorrect. While it is true that for Liénard-Wiechert potentials $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$, the expression given for $V$ is the static one, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, option C correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are fundamental quantities in electromagnetism known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:** The electromagnetic field does not propagate instantaneously. The field experienced at a position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ was generated by the source charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The information traveled from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the speed of light, $c$.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Variables:** The problem defines the necessary variables:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} \\big|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point, i.e., $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n\n3.  **The Retardation Condition:** The time it took for the field to travel from $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to $\\vec{r}$ is $(t - t_r)$. The distance traveled is $d$. Since the field propagates at speed $c$, this relationship is expressed as:\n    $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Potentials:** The general formulas for potentials from time-varying sources are the retarded potentials. For a point charge, the integration of these formulas leads to a specific form that accounts for relativistic effects (like length contraction of the volume element from the observer's perspective). The standard result from classical electrodynamics gives the potentials as:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\n\n    The term $[ \\dots ]_{\\text{retarded}}$ means all source-related quantities inside the brackets ($d, \\vec{d}, \\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n5.  **Reformatting the Expressions:** The provided options have a slightly different algebraic form.

We can get to that form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our standard expressions by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Final Comparison:** Now, we compare these final expressions with the given choices:\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are non-relativistic forms.\n    *   B) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of the correct `-`.\n    *   **C) Correct.** These expressions exactly match the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The scalar potential is given by the static formula, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
