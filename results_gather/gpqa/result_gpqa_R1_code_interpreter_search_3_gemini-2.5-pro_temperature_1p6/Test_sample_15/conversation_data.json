    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Unless this specific combination of stereocenters results in a meso compound (which is highly unlikely for such a complex, unsymmetrical structure), the molecule is chiral.\n    *   A single enantiomer is by definition chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   We need to check if the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Let's draw the Fischer projection for the (2R,3S) isomer:\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (R)\n             |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (S)\n              |\n            COOH\n        ```\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.

The notation (1s,3s,5s) refers to the stereoisomer where all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring (the cis isomer).\n    *   Let's check for chirality at C1. The two paths around the ring from C1 are C1-C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6-C1 and C1-C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2-C1. These two paths are identical. Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers (they are prochiral).\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, in a chair conformation where all OH groups are axial (or all are equatorial), there are three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers (a carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to one H, two identical methyl (-CH3) groups, and the `-CH2-` group.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `ClCH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The presence of the double bond means that the two carbon atoms of the double bond and the four atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) all lie in the same plane. A planar molecule always has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name itself provides the necessary information. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. By naming a specific stereoisomer (one out of several possibilities), it implies that this isomer is chiral. While it's theoretically possible for a molecule with R and S centers to be a meso compound (achiral), it is extremely unlikely for a complex, unsymmetrical structure like this one. A single, pure enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and `-CH(CH3)COOH`) are identical to those on C3. When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), there is an internal plane of symmetry between them. This type of compound is called a *meso* compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive** (it is a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two identical stereocenters, but both have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetrical molecule possesses several elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the average plane of the ring. It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposing C-H bond. Due to these symmetry planes, the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's look for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other potential chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the cyclopentyl ring, the carbonyl group, and the C2-C3 bond, bisecting the two methyl groups.

Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: How many of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity?\n\n(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nA) 5\nB) 2\nC) 4\nD) 3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
