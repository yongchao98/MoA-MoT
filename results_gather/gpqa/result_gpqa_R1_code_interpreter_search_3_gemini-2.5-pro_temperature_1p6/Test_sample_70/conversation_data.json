    "*   **1. Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula shows that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*), assuming other factors like stellar luminosity and albedo are constant.\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n*   **2. Formulate the Temperature Ratio**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet 4 ($T_4$) to that of Planet 2 ($T_2$).\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n    Since the problem states that the planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, all other factors in the full equilibrium temperature equation cancel out.\n\n*   **3. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (*a*).\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n*   **4. Express the Ratio of Orbital Distances in Terms of Orbital Periods**\n    Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, we can express the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_4$) in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods ($P_2/P_4$).\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n*   **5. Substitute the Period Ratio into the Temperature Ratio Equation**\n    Now, substitute the expression for $a_2/a_4$ back into our temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n*   **6. Calculate the Final Value**\n    The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, the ratio of the period of Planet 2 to Planet 4 is:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n    Now, plug this into our final equation for the temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    \n    Let's perform the calculation.\n```python\np_ratio = 2 / 3.5\ntemp_ratio = p_ratio**(1/3)\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the energy it receives from its host star. The amount of energy received is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (*a*) from the star (inverse square law for flux). The planet's temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to the fourth root of the power it radiates. Combining these, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance.\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    This relationship holds true because the problem states the planets orbit the same star (so stellar luminosity is constant) and have the same albedo (so the fraction of light reflected is the same for both).\n\n2.  **Formulate the ratio of the temperatures.**\n    We want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 ($T_4$) to that of Planet_2 ($T_2$). Using the proportionality from step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n    Here, $a_2$ and $a_4$ are the semi-major axes (orbital distances) of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to relate orbital distance to orbital period.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for any two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of the square of their orbital periods (*P*) is equal to the ratio of the cube of their semi-major axes (*a*).\n    $(\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^2 = (\\frac{a_2}{a_4})^3$\n    We can solve this for the ratio of the semi-major axes that we need for our temperature equation:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Combine the equations.**\n    Substitute the expression for the ratio of distances from step 3 into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}}$\n    Simplifying the exponent gives:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = ((\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3})^{1/2} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n    This shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is equal to the cube root of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerical value.**\n    The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods: $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the period of Planet_2 to Planet_4:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n    Now, plug this into our final equation:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n    To find the precise numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_2 to Planet_4\np_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemp_ratio = p_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.8299. This value is closest to the provided option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Here is the step-by-step derivation.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*), given that the stellar luminosity and the planet's albedo are constant. Since both planets orbit the same star and are assumed to have the same albedo, this condition is met.\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Temperature Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 ($T_4$) to Planet_2 ($T_2$). Based on the relationship above:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n    where $a_2$ and $a_4$ are the orbital distances of Planet_2 and Planet_4.\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law**: This law connects a planet's orbital period (*P*) to its orbital distance (*a*). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Relating Distance Ratio to Period Ratio**: Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, we can express the ratio of the orbital distances in terms of their orbital periods:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n5.  **Final Combined Equation**: Substitute the expression for the distance ratio ($a_2/a_4$) back into our temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$. We are interested in the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4.\n    *   Relative period of Planet_2, $P_2 = 2$\n    *   Relative period of Planet_4, $P_4 = 3.5$\n    \n    Now, we plug these values into our final equation:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8299$\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is an excellent orbital mechanics problem that combines Kepler's Third Law with the principles of thermal equilibrium. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which is $\\frac{T_4}{T_2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. Assuming the star is a black body and the planet has a uniform temperature, the relationship is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} (1 - \\text{albedo})^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the star's temperature and radius, and *a* is the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant) and have the same albedo, all terms are constant except for the orbital distance, *a*. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** Using the proportionality from step 2, we can write the ratio of the temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\n4.  **Introduce Kepler's Third Law:** We don't have the orbital distances (*a*), but we have the orbital periods (*P*). Kepler's Third Law provides the connection. For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n5.  **Relate Distance Ratio to Period Ratio:** From Kepler's Third Law, we can establish a ratio for our two planets:\n    $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_4}\\right)^3$\n    To use this in our temperature equation, we need to solve for the distance ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n6.  **Combine and Solve:** Now substitute the expression for the distance ratio (from step 5) into the temperature ratio equation (from step 3):\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}}$\n    Simplifying the exponents (by multiplying them: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$) gives us the final elegant relationship:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_2 is $P_2 = 2$.\n    *   The relative period for Planet_4 is $P_4 = 3.5$.\n\n    Plugging these values into our equation:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Let's compute the precise value using Python.\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital period of Planet_2 to Planet_4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The temperature ratio (T4/T2) is the cube root of the period ratio (P2/P4).\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.8299, which rounds to 0.83.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final calculated ratio is ~0.83, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a clear, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. The Physics of Equilibrium Temperature\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the energy it absorbs from its star. The energy received is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance (*a*) from the star. The temperature itself is related to the fourth root of this energy. This leads to the following relationship for planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n### 2. Formulating the Temperature Ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet 4 ($T_4$) to that of Planet 2 ($T_2$). Using the relationship from step 1, we can write:\n\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_4}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nwhere $a_2$ and $a_4$ are the orbital distances of Planet 2 and Planet 4, respectively.\n\n### 3. Using Kepler's Third Law\n\nWe are given the orbital periods (*P*), not the distances (*a*). Kepler's Third Law provides the link: for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance.\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nFrom this, we can form a ratio for our two planets:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_4}\\right)^3$\n\nSolving for the ratio of distances, $\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n### 4. Combining the Equations\n\nNow, we substitute the result from Kepler's Law (step 3) into our temperature ratio equation (step 2):\n\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}}$\n\nWe can simplify the exponents by multiplying them: $(\\frac{2}{3}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{3}$. This gives us our final equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nThe problem states the orbital period ratios are $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n*   The relative period for Planet 2 is $P_2 = 2$.\n*   The relative period for Planet 4 is $P_4 = 3.5$.\n\nPlugging these values into our final equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8299$\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives 0.83.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
