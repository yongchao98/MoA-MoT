    "This is a two-body decay problem of a stationary particle. We can solve this using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The positive pion (π⁺) is at rest.\n*   Initial momentum, p_initial = 0.\n*   Initial total energy, E_initial = m_πc², which is the rest mass energy of the pion.\n*   E_initial = 139.6 MeV.\n\n**2.

    "The problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). We can solve this using the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial pion (π⁺) is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. According to the principle of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero.\n\n*   `p_initial = 0`\n*   `p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0`\n\nThis means the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n*   `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n\n### 2. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\nWe are given:\n*   Rest mass energy of π⁺, `m_πc² = 139.6 MeV`\n*   Rest mass energy of μ⁺, `m_μc² = 105.7 MeV`\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to have a rest mass of zero (`m_ν = 0`).\n\n### 3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation\n\nFor any particle, the total energy (E) is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation:\n`E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`\n\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n    `E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n    So, `E_μ = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`\n\n*   **For the massless neutrino (ν):**\n    `E_ν² = (pc)² + (0)²`\n    So, `E_ν = pc`\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nNow we substitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_πc² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc`\n\nTo solve for the momentum `p`, we rearrange and square the equation:\n`m_πc² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`\n`(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n`(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n\nThe `(pc)²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²`\n\nNow, we solve for `pc`:\n`2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²`\n`pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`pc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`pc = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`pc ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n### 5. Finding the Kinetic Energies\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    `KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy (`KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²`). We can find the total energy of the muon from the initial energy conservation equation:\n    `E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν`\n    `E_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV`\n    Now we can find the kinetic energy:\n    `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc² = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, we get:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon ≈ **4.1 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\nThese values correspond to option D. The slight discrepancy from 4.12 to 4.1 is due to rounding during the calculation steps. Using a more precise calculation gives 4.12 MeV.\n\nFinal calculation results are:\n*   **KE of muon (μ⁺): 4.12 MeV**\n*   **KE of neutrino (ν): 29.8 MeV**\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **1. Principles of Conservation**\n\nThe decay of a stationary particle into two product particles is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n### **2. Initial State**\n\n*   The positive pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Initial Momentum, `p_initial = 0`.\n*   Initial Energy, `E_initial`, is the rest mass energy of the pion, `E_initial = m_πc²`.\n    *   `E_initial = 139.6 MeV`\n\n### **3. Final State**\n\n*   The products are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   Let the momentum of the muon be `p_μ` and the neutrino be `p_ν`.\n*   Let the total energy of the muon be `E_μ` and the neutrino be `E_ν`.\n\n### **4. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n*   `p_μ = p_ν = p` (in terms of magnitude)\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy equals the sum of the total energies of the products.\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n### **5. Using the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the formula `E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`.\n\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n    `E_μ = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`, where `m_μc² = 105.7 MeV`.\n\n*   **For the neutrino (ν):**\n    Neutrinos have a rest mass that is effectively zero in this context (`m_ν ≈ 0`).\n    `E_ν = sqrt((pc)² + 0) = pc`.\n    This also means the neutrino's entire energy is kinetic energy (`KE_ν = E_ν`).\n\n### **6. Solving for the Kinetic Energies**\n\n1.  Substitute the expressions for `E_μ` and `E_ν` into the energy conservation equation:\n    `m_πc² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc`\n\n2.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root and solve for `pc`:\n    `m_πc² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`\n    Square both sides:\n    `(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n    `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n\n3.  The `(pc)²` terms cancel. Now, solve for `pc`:\n    `(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)`\n    `pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]`\n\n4.  Plug in the given values:\n    `pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    `pc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    `pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **Neutrino:** As established, `KE_ν = E_ν = pc`.\n        `KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n    *   **Muon:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (`KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²`). We can find the total energy of the muon using the initial energy conservation:\n        `E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV`\n        `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc² = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.1 MeV (for the muon) and 29.8 MeV (for the neutrino). The more precise values from the computation are **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV** (when rounded).\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem can be solved using the principles of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** in the context of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a positive pion (π⁺) at rest.\n*   **Initial Momentum (`p_initial`)**: Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is `0`.\n*   **Initial Energy (`E_initial`)**: Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    *   `E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV`\n\n### 2.

Conservation of Momentum\n\nThe total momentum before must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   `p_initial = p_final`\n*   `0 = p_μ + p_ν`\nThis tells us that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.

Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): `E_μ = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): `E_ν = sqrt((pc)² + 0²) = pc`\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\n1.  Substitute the energy expressions into the conservation equation:\n    `m_πc² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc`\n\n2.  Now, we solve for the unknown momentum `p` (or more conveniently, the term `pc`). Rearrange the equation:\n    `m_πc² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)`\n\n3.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    `(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n    `(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²`\n\n4.  The `(pc)²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `pc`:\n    `(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)`\n    `pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]`\n\n5.  Plug in the given values:\n    `pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]`\n    `pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / [279.2]`\n    `pc = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n    `pc ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n### 6. Determine the Kinetic Energies (KE)\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (`KE_ν`)**:\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy (`E_ν = pc`) is equal to its kinetic energy.\n    `KE_ν = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (`KE_μ`)**:\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy: `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²`.
