    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` (knock-out of G2) results in 0% resistance, a complete loss of the resistance phenotype. This is the most severe phenotype observed.\n    *   The double mutants that include the `g2` mutation (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also show 0% resistance.\n    *   The phenotype of the `g2` mutant (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` mutant (75% resistance) and the `g3` mutant (50% resistance). When the phenotype of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another, this is called **epistasis**. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) that acts upstream of other genes. Since G2's absence completely shuts down the resistance pathway, it is the most logical candidate for this upstream transcription factor. It likely controls the expression of G1, G3, or other necessary resistance genes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance (a 25% drop from the 100% control).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance (a 50% drop from the control).\n    *   If their effects were purely additive, the double mutant `g1g3` would be expected to show a resistance drop of 25% + 50% = 75%, leaving 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the experimental result for the `g1g3` double mutant is 10% resistance, which is a 90% drop.\n    *   Since the observed effect in the double mutant (90% drop) is much greater than the sum of the individual effects (75% drop), this demonstrates a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   This synergy suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through pathways that are at least partially independent but converge on the same overall phenotype. The loss of both is much more detrimental than expected. This type of relationship, where two genes have overlapping or compensatory functions, is often described as **partial gene redundancy**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the provided options based on the analysis.**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n        *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": Incorrect. If G3 were epistatic, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would be identical to the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is the most plausible description among the choices for the observed synergistic interaction.\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect. If G1 were epistatic, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would be identical to the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Incorrect. The `g1` mutant has a milder phenotype than the `g2` mutant. G2 is the TF.\n        *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": This statement is correct (`g1g2` at 0% matches `g2` at 0%), but the first part of the option is wrong.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\": Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data on one trait (resistance), so this cannot be concluded.\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    All options contain at least one incorrect statement (specifically, the claims of epistasis between G1 and G3 are all contradicted by the data). We must choose the \"best fit\" option.\n    *   Options A, B, and D correctly identify G2 as the transcription factor. Option C is incorrect on this fundamental point.\n    *   Comparing the descriptions of the G1-G3 interaction in options A, B, and D:\n        *   A: \"same promoter\" - plausible but speculative.\n        *   B: \"gene redundancy\" - a reasonable biological description for the observed synergy.\n        *   D: \"pleiotropy\" - an unsupported claim.\n    *   Option B contains the most accurate and data-supported claims: G2 is the transcription factor, and the relationship between G1 and G3 is best described as a form of redundancy (leading to synergy). The final claim (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is an error in the question's options, but Option B is otherwise the strongest choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The knock-out mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of the resistance phenotype.\n    *   Any double mutant that includes `g2` (i.e., `g1g2` and `g2g3`) also shows 0% resistance.\n    *   This means the phenotype of the `g2` mutation completely masks the phenotypes of `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance).

Because the absence of G2 completely eliminates the resistance pathway, regardless of the status of G1 and G3, G2 is the most logical candidate for this upstream transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Gene G1 and Gene G3:**\n    *   We need to compare the single mutants (`g1` and `g3`) with the double mutant (`g1g3`).\n    *   Loss of G1 (`g1` mutant) causes a drop in resistance of 25% (from 100% to 75%).\n    *   Loss of G3 (`g3` mutant) causes a drop in resistance of 50% (from 100% to 50%).\n    *   If the genes acted in completely independent, additive pathways, we would expect the double mutant to have a combined drop of 25% + 50% = 75%, leaving 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant shows only 10% resistance, a drop of 90%.\n    *   Since the effect of the double mutant (90% loss) is much more severe than the sum of the individual effects (75% loss), this is a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   This synergy suggests that G1 and G3 have functions that are partially overlapping or compensatory. This relationship is best described as **partial gene redundancy**. While they have different individual contribution levels (G3 is more important than G1), losing both is nearly catastrophic to the pathway, much more so than a simple addition of their effects would predict.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. The data shows `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g3` (50%), so G3 is not epistatic to G1.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This is the best fit. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor. It correctly interprets the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. Although the final clause \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g1` phenotype of 75%), the first two points are the most accurate conclusions from the data. This appears to be a flaw in the question's options, but this option remains the best choice.\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. G1 is not the primary transcription factor; G2 is.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** Incorrect. Pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be concluded from this experiment, which only measures resistance. Also, G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option B provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions, despite one flawed clause.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a genetic interaction problem. Let's break it down by analyzing the functions of the genes based on the mutant phenotypes.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the role of Gene G2\n\n*   **Single mutant `g2`:** Resistance is 0%. This is the most severe phenotype, representing a total loss of the resistance trait being measured.\n*   **Double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3`:** Resistance is also 0% in both cases.\n*   **Conclusion:** The phenotype of the `g2` mutant (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` mutant (75% resistance) and the `g3` mutant (50% resistance). When a mutation in one gene (G2) masks the effect of a mutation in another gene (G1 or G3), this is the definition of **epistasis**. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n*   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Since the loss of G2 function completely abolishes the resistance pathway regardless of the status of G1 and G3, G2 is the most logical candidate for this upstream transcription factor. It likely controls the expression of G1, G3, and/or other genes essential for resistance.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the relationship between Gene G1 and Gene G3\n\n*   **Single mutant `g1`:** Resistance is 75%, meaning its product contributes about 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75% = 25% loss).\n*   **Single mutant `g3`:** Resistance is 50%, meaning its product contributes about 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50% = 50% loss).\n*   **Double mutant `g1g3`:** Resistance is 10%.\n*   **Analysis of interaction:** If the two genes acted in separate, additive pathways, the expected resistance of the double mutant would be 100% - (25% loss + 50% loss) = 25%. However, the observed resistance is only 10%, which is a much more severe phenotype than expected from simple addition. This phenomenon, where the double mutant shows a more severe phenotype than the sum of the individual mutants, is called a **synergistic interaction**.\n*   **Biological interpretation:** Synergy often implies that the genes have overlapping or compensatory functions. In this context, **gene redundancy** (or partial redundancy) is the best explanation. G1 and G3 likely function in partially parallel pathways that contribute to the same overall resistance trait. Losing both is significantly more detrimental than the simple sum of their individual losses would suggest.\n*   **Epistasis Check:** Neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other. If G1 were epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would match the `g1` phenotype (75%). It doesn't. If G3 were epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would match the `g3` phenotype (50%). It doesn't.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. It correctly identifies G2 as the TF, but incorrectly claims G3 is epistatic to G1.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This is the strongest option. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor and correctly interprets the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as a form of gene redundancy. The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is factually incorrect based on the data, but the first two statements are the most accurate conclusions. This appears to be an error in the construction of the answer choice, but it remains the best overall fit.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. G1 is not the primary transcription factor; G2 is.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** Incorrect. Pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple unrelated traits) cannot be determined from this experiment. It also incorrectly claims G1 is epistatic to G3.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B contains the most correct conclusions derived from the experimental data.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "This is a problem about interpreting genetic interactions from the phenotypes of single and double mutants. Let's break down the data to understand the roles of G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Gene Functions\n\n1.  **Analyze Gene G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows **0% resistance**. This is the most severe phenotype, indicating a complete loss of the resistance pathway.\n    *   The double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also show **0% resistance**.\n    *   This means the `g2` mutation's phenotype (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance).

This phenotype is much more severe than the expected additive effect. This is known as a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   Synergistic interactions often imply **gene redundancy** (or partial redundancy).
