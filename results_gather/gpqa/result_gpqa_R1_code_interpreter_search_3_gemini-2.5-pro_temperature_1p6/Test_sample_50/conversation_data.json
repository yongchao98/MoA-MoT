    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V=0). We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** This is a classic electrostatics problem that is most easily solved using the \"method of images.\" This method allows us to replace the complex problem of induced charges on the surface of the conductor with a simpler problem involving a fictitious \"image charge.\" The electric field *outside* the sphere is identical to the field that would be produced by the original charge `q` and an image charge `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Location:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge location: `b = R^2/d`\n    The image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the real charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. In this context, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential energy is zero) to the distance `d` from the sphere.\n\n    There's a key formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of conductors: `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges. In our case, \"other charges\" refers to the induced surface charge on the grounded sphere.\n\n5.  **Finding the Potential at `q`:** According to the method of images, the potential `V_other` at the location of `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The location of the real charge `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The location of the image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Now, calculate the potential `V_other` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n    `V_other = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d - b)`:\n    `V_other = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n    `V_other = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Energy:** Now we use the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *A note on the (1/2) factor:* This factor is crucial. It arises because the induced charges on the sphere are not a fixed source of potential. Their distribution and magnitude depend on the position of the charge `q`. The work done is `W = ∫ F ⋅ dr`, and performing this integration also yields the factor of 1/2. The formula `U = (1/2)qV` correctly accounts for the energy stored in the electric field of the entire system.\n\n7.  **Comparing with the Options:** The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given choices:\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    Our result matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>",

    "This problem is a classic example of using the **method of images** in electrostatics to calculate potential energy. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe core idea is to replace the complex system of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere with a simpler, equivalent system. The electric field *outside* the sphere can be exactly replicated by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere's original volume.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from its center, the image charge and its location are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Image charge (q'):** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge location (b):** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center)\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to assemble it. Specifically, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where potential and energy are zero) to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nA key formula for the interaction energy between a point charge and the charges it induces on a conductor is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere:\n*   `q` is the real point charge.\n*   `V_induced` is the electric potential at the location of the charge `q`, created by all the *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n*   The factor of **1/2** is essential. It arises because the induced charge distribution is not fixed; it builds up as the charge `q` is brought closer, so the force is not constant.\n\n### 3. Finding `V_induced`\n\nAccording to the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n1.  **Find the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.**\n    *   Distance = `d - b`\n    *   Distance = `d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential from `q'` at this distance.**\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and the distance:\n        `V_induced = k * [ -q * (R/d) ] / [ (d^2 - R^2) / d ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression for `V_induced`.**\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n    *   `V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4.

Conclusion\n\nThe final expression for the net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
