    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the components and their nature:**\n    *   `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid.\n    *   `Ba(OH)2` (barium hydroxide) is a strong base.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L)\n    *   Moles of `CH3COOH` = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of `HCl` = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol. Since `HCl` is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 mol of `H+` ions.\n    *   Moles of `Ba(OH)2` = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol. Since `Ba(OH)2` is a strong base, it dissociates into one `Ba2+` ion and two `OH-` ions. Therefore, moles of `OH-` ions = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n3.  **Simulate the neutralization reactions:**\n    *   Acid-base reactions are essentially instantaneous. The strongest acid will react with the strongest base first. In this case, the `H+` from `HCl` (strong acid) will react with the `OH-` from `Ba(OH)2` (strong base).\n        *   Reaction: `H+` + `OH-` → `H2O`\n        *   Initial moles `H+` (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n        *   Initial moles `OH-` (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n        *   `OH-` is in excess. All the `H+` from `HCl` will be consumed.\n        *   Moles of `OH-` remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (`OH-`) will react with the weak acid (`CH3COOH`).\n        *   Reaction: `CH3COOH` + `OH-` → `CH3COO-` + `H2O`\n        *   Initial moles `CH3COOH` = 0.050 mol\n        *   Moles of `OH-` available = 0.100 mol\n        *   Again, `OH-` is in excess. All the `CH3COOH` will be consumed.\n        *   Moles of `OH-` remaining after this second reaction = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the final composition and calculate the pH:**\n    *   After all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (`OH-`). The presence of a strong base will dominate the pH of the solution. The other major species in the solution is the acetate ion (`CH3COO-`), which is a weak base, but its contribution to the overall `OH-` concentration is negligible compared to the excess strong base.\n    *   Moles of excess `OH-` = 0.050 mol.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the final solution:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n    *   Calculate the final concentration of `OH-`:\n        *   [`OH-`] = Moles of excess `OH-` / Total Volume\n        *   [`OH-`] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M.\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log10([`OH-`])\n        *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   Calculate the pH:\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial moles\n# Moles = Molarity * Volume (in L)\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_ba_oh_2 = 0.3 * 0.300\n\n# Moles of acidic and basic species\nmoles_h_plus_strong = moles_hcl\nmoles_oh_minus_strong = 2 * moles_ba_oh_2\n\n# Step 2: Simulate neutralization reactions\n# a) Strong acid vs. strong base\nmoles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction = moles_oh_minus_strong - moles_h_plus_strong\n\n# b) Remaining strong base vs. weak acid\nmoles_oh_final = moles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 3: Calculate final pH\n# Calculate total volume\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n\n# Calculate final concentration of the excess species (OH-)\nconc_oh_final = moles_oh_final / total_volume_L\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npoh = -math.log10(conc_oh_final)\nph = 14 - poh\n\nprint(f\"{ph=:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves the reaction of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2).
