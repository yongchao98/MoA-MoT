    "The user wants to determine the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. System Identification and Hamiltonian**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The \"isotropic\" nature means the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along the x, y, and z axes.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere each $H_i$ is the Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator:\n$H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial q_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q_i^2$ for $q_i = x, y, z$.\n\n**2. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nFor the 3D isotropic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet the principal quantum number be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n\n**3. Determining the Third Excited State Energy**\n\nWe can find the energy for the first few levels:\n*   **Ground State:** $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4.

    "*   **1. Understanding the System and its Energy Levels**\n\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. The term \"isotropic\" means the restoring force (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three dimensions (x, y, z).\n\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates, effectively treating it as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_k = (k + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer quantum number.\n\n    For the 3D case, the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are the quantum numbers for the x, y, and z dimensions, respectively, and can take any integer value $0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\n    Combining the terms, we get the total energy formula:\n    $E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then determined by the value of $n$:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n\n*   **2. Calculating the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\n    We need to find the energy for the state labeled as the \"third excited state\". Let's list the energy levels starting from the lowest energy:\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the minimum value for $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is $0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$).\n        Energy of Ground State ($n=0$): $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level up, corresponding to $n=1$.\n        Energy of First Excited State ($n=1$): $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **Second Excited State:** The next level corresponds to $n=2$.\n        Energy of Second Excited State ($n=2$): $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **Third Excited State:** Finally, the third excited state corresponds to $n=3$.\n        Energy of Third Excited State ($n=3$): $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **3. Finding the Degeneracy (Number of Independent Eigenfunctions)**\n\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (in this case, different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find how many ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    We can list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — This gives 3 distinct states.\n    2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — This gives 6 distinct states (permutations of 2, 1, 0).\n    3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) — This gives 1 distinct state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, there is a general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Each of these 10 states corresponds to a unique, linearly independent eigenfunction, so there are 10 possible eigenfunctions for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n*   **4. Final Answer**\n\n    The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
