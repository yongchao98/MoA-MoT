    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and the types of bonds.\nThe given compound is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\nLet's break down the formula to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n-   **(CH3)2C=**: This part has 3 Carbon atoms and 6 Hydrogen atoms.\n-   **-CH-**: This part has 1 Carbon atom and 1 Hydrogen atom.\n-   **-CH2-**: This part has 1 Carbon atom and 2 Hydrogen atoms.\n-   **-CH(CH3)-**: This part has 2 Carbon atoms (one in the chain, one in the methyl group) and 4 Hydrogen atoms (1+3).\n-   **-CH2-**: This part has 1 Carbon atom and 2 Hydrogen atoms.\n-   **-CH=**: This part has 1 Carbon atom and 1 Hydrogen atom.\n-   **=C(CH3)2**: This part has 3 Carbon atoms and 6 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\nTotal number of Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **Step 2: Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, let's count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.\nThe structure can be visualized as a chain with methyl side groups.\n-   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds indicated by `C=C`. One at the beginning `(CH3)2C=CH-` and one at the end `-CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n-   **C-C single bonds**: For a non-cyclic molecule with 'n' carbon atoms, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages (single, double, or triple) is n-1. Here, n=12, so there are 11 C-C linkages. Since 2 of them are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Number of C-C single bonds = 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n-   **C-H bonds**: We already counted the hydrogen atoms, and since each is bonded to a carbon, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound. We can calculate this by summing the bond energies of all the bonds.\n\nΔHa(product) = (Number of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (Number of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (Number of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n\nUsing the given bond energies:\n-   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n-   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n-   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔHa(product) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔHa(product) = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔHa(product) = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to find the enthalpy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas) into gaseous atoms.\nΔHa(reactants) = (12 × Enthalpy of atomization of C) + (11 × Bond energy of H-H)\n\nUsing the given values:\n-   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol\n-   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔHa(reactants) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔHa(reactants) = 12000 + 1100\nΔHa(reactants) = 13100 kJ/mol\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of the compound can be calculated using the following relationship based on Hess's Law:\nΔHf = ΔHa(reactants) - ΔHa(product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 6: Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's convert this to kJ/g to see if it matches any of the options.\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of C12H22. Using integer atomic masses for consistency with the simplified data:\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n-   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22. Since each hydrogen is bonded to a carbon atom, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n-   **C-C single bonds**: For a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages (single, double, triple) is n-1, where n is the number of carbon atoms.

Using integer atomic masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) is appropriate given the simplified integer values for bond energies.\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value rounds to **11.44 kJ/g**, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to analyze the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and the types of bonds.\nThe given compound is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\nLet's determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms by summing the atoms in each part of the structure:\n-   **(CH3)2C=**: 3 Carbon atoms, 6 Hydrogen atoms\n-   **-CH-**: 1 Carbon atom, 1 Hydrogen atom\n-   **-CH2-**: 1 Carbon atom, 2 Hydrogen atoms\n-   **-CH(CH3)-**: 2 Carbon atoms (1 in the chain, 1 in the methyl group), 4 Hydrogen atoms (1+3)\n-   **-CH2-**: 1 Carbon atom, 2 Hydrogen atoms\n-   **-CH=**: 1 Carbon atom, 1 Hydrogen atom\n-   **=C(CH3)2**: 3 Carbon atoms, 6 Hydrogen atoms\n\nSumming these up:\n-   Total Carbon atoms (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12**\n-   Total Hydrogen atoms (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **Step 2: Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNext, we count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.\n-   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22. Each hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n-   **C=C bonds**: The chemical formula clearly indicates two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`). Thus, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n-   **C-C single bonds**: For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages (of any type) is always one less than the number of carbon atoms. With 12 carbon atoms, there are 12 - 1 = 11 total C-C linkages. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds.\n    Number of C-C single bonds = 11 (total linkages) - 2 (double bonds) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (Product)**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization (ΔHa) of the compound is the energy required to break all the chemical bonds in one mole of the compound in its gaseous state.

This is an application of Hess's Law.\n\nΔHf = ΔHa(reactants) - ΔHa(product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 6: Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.

Option C has the correct numerical value but incorrect units. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option D.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.

Since 2 are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of reactants (ΔHa(reactants)) is the energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms:\nΔHa(reactants) = (12 × Enthalpy of atomization of C) + (11 × Bond energy of H-H)\nUsing the given values:\nΔHa(reactants) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔHa(reactants) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the product (ΔHa(product)) is the sum of all bond energies in one mole of the gaseous compound:\nΔHa(product) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nUsing the bond counts and given bond energies:\nΔHa(product) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔHa(product) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the energy difference between atomizing the reactants and atomizing the product:\nΔHf = ΔHa(reactants) - ΔHa(product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 5: Compare with Options and Convert Units if Necessary**\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the ΔHa of the product, not ΔHf)\nC) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect units)\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nSince our value in kJ/mol (1900) doesn't match option A and option C has the wrong units, we should convert our answer to kJ/g to check option D.\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of C12H22 using integer masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol).\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, we convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n```python\nprint(1900 / 166)\n```\n11.44578313253012\n\nThe result is approximately 11.45 kJ/g, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
