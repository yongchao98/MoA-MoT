    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes a particle annihilation event. A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and are annihilated, creating four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. We need to find the velocity of these created particles.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    In any particle interaction, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved.\n\n    *   **Initial State:** The system consists of a proton and an antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This phrase is commonly used in such problems to imply that the annihilation occurs \"at rest,\" meaning the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible. In this frame of reference (the center-of-mass frame), the total initial momentum is zero.\n        *   Total Initial Momentum ($P_i$): $P_i = 0$.\n        *   Total Initial Energy ($E_i$): The initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n            *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$.\n            *   A proton and an antiproton have the same mass ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n            *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n            *   Therefore, $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n    *   **Final State:** The system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. The four final particles must be ejected in such a way that the vector sum of their momenta is zero.\n        *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four final particles. The most symmetric and simplest outcome is that the available energy is distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles. This means each of the four particles will have the same total energy ($E_A$) and thus the same velocity magnitude ($v$).\n        *   Total Final Energy ($E_f$): $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n        *   The energy of a single relativistic particle $A$ is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n        *   So, $E_f = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n3.  **Equate Initial and Final Energies:**\n    $E_i = E_f$\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v$):**\n    The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$, where $\\beta = v/c$. We need to solve for $\\beta$.\n    *   Square the equation: $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   Rearrange to solve for $\\beta^2$: $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   Solve for $\\beta$: $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Final Answer:**\n    The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$. This corresponds to option A.\n\nWe can use Python to perform the calculation with higher precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272088  # Proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0       # Particle A rest mass energy in MeV\nc = 1.0              # Speed of light in units of c\n\n# Initial Energy (Annihilation at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Final Energy is distributed among 4 particles A\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# E_initial = E_final\n# gamma = E_initial / (4 * m_A_c2)\ngamma = E_initial / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity of particle A (beta = v/c): {beta:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The velocity is approximately {beta:.2f}c\")\n\n```\nThe calculation confirms the result.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principles:** The problem involves a particle annihilation process. The fundamental principles that govern such interactions are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of total momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics problems where rest mass energies are very large, \"slowly moving\" is a standard phrase indicating that the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. We can approximate the process as happening with the proton and antiproton initially at rest.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum (Initial):** If the particles are considered to be at rest in the center-of-mass frame, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) of the system is zero.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy (Initial):** The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n        *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n        *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   Therefore, the total initial energy is $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$.\n        *   $E_i = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same rest mass, $m_A$.
