    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems.\n\n### **1. Identify the Goal and Given Information**\n\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_system1 / M_system2).\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n### **2. Select the Appropriate Physical Formula**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) can be determined using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n### **3. Simplify the Formula for a Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Let's write out the full expression for the ratio:\n\nRatio = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2πG * sin^3(i2)) ]\n\nSeveral terms can be simplified or canceled:\n\n*   The term `2πG` is a constant and appears in both the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out.\n*   The problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This is a critical piece of information, as it means the orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. For an eclipse to occur, the inclination angle `i` must be very close to 90 degrees. We can therefore assume `i ≈ 90°` for both systems, which means `sin(i) ≈ 1`. Thus, the `sin^3(i)` term for both systems is approximately 1 and also cancels out.\n\nThe simplified formula for the mass ratio becomes:\n\nRatio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3)\n\n### **4. Calculate the Ratio using the Given Values**\n\nNow, we substitute the values for each system into the simplified formula. It's not necessary to convert units (from years to seconds, or km/s to m/s) because we are calculating a ratio, and the units will cancel out.\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nLet's compute the ratio using a Python script for precision.\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_total = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_total = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the ratio: P1 * (K1_total)^3\nnumerator = P1 * (K1_total)**3\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the ratio: P2 * (K2_total)^3\ndenominator = P2 * (K2_total)**3\n\n# Compute the final mass ratio\nmass_ratio = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n### **5.

    "This problem requires us to compare the total masses of two binary star systems. The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be found using a form of Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**1. Underlying Physics**\n\nFor a binary system where the radial velocities of both stars can be measured (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), the total mass M_total = (m1 + m2) is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight (i=90° for an edge-on orbit).\n\n**2.

This is crucial information because eclipses only occur when the orbital plane is nearly aligned with our line of sight, meaning the inclination `i` is very close to 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. We can assume this for both systems, so the sin³(i) terms also cancel out.\n\nThe simplified formula for the ratio becomes:\n\nRatio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)\n\n**3.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2.\n\n**1. Identify the Relevant Physical Law**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2πG * sin³(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity amplitudes.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\n**2.

Since this is true for both systems, the `sin³(i)` term also cancels out from the ratio.\n\nThe simplified formula for the mass ratio becomes:\n\nRatio = (P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ᵦ)³) / (P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ᵦ)³)\n\n**3.
