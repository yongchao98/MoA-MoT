    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's break down the problem into different frames of reference.\n\n1.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's frame of reference. The observer is stationary in this frame. The glass is observed to be moving with a velocity `v`.\n    *   **S' (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame of reference in which the glass is stationary. The light beam propagates through the glass in this frame.\n\n2.  **Determine Velocities in Each Frame:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass's rest frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S).
