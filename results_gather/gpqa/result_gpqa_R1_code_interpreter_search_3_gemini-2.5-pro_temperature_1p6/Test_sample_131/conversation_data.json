    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nWe are given the following data for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets (except for potentially unresolved couplings) gives us crucial information about the symmetry and substitution patterns of the molecules. A singlet in the aromatic region means an aromatic proton has no adjacent protons. A singlet for a methyl group is standard unless it's attached to a chiral center or other complex environments.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectra of the Candidate Compounds\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 3 and 6. Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 4 and 6. The plane of symmetry makes them chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **one singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the symmetry plane and is unique. This gives **one singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also on the symmetry plane and is unique. This gives **one singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 5 and 6. They are adjacent to each other. They will be coupled and appear as **two doublets**, not singlets. This immediately rules out any mixture containing this compound.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** Two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incompatible with the \"two singlets\" description in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. This fits.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Four equivalent protons, giving a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show coupling. We expect a **quartet** (for the 2 x CH2) and a **triplet** (for the 2 x CH3). The problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incompatible with the \"all singlets\" description in the alkyl region.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nBased on the individual analysis, we can immediately eliminate options containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene or 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene - **Incorrect** (Prehnitene gives doublets).\n*   C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene - **Incorrect** (1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and a triplet).\n*   D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene - **Incorrect** (Prehnitene gives doublets).\n\nThis leaves only option B. Let's verify if it fits the data perfectly.\n\n### 4. Verify Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nLet's predict the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of Durene and Isodurene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 molar mixture and each signal corresponds to 2 protons, the integrals will be equal. The ratio will be **1:1**.\n    *   This is a perfect match with the problem description.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet of intensity 12H.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of intensity 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   In total, we have four potential signals with relative integrals of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states that the mixture shows only **three signals** with a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from Durene) + 12 (from Isodurene) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrals of:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   To get three signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H from the available signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), it must be that the two 3H signals from Isodurene have the same chemical shift (this is called accidental equivalence or isochrony) and thus appear as a single 6H peak.\n    *   With this reasonable assumption, the mixture spectrum would contain:\n        1.  The 12H singlet from Durene.\n        2.  The 6H singlet from Isodurene (from C1 and C3 methyls).\n        3.  A 6H singlet from the combined, isochronous C2 and C5 methyls of Isodurene.\n    *   This gives three signals with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This is a perfect match with the problem description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture is consistent with all the NMR data provided is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires us to determine which two of the four given aromatic compounds are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on its ¹H NMR spectrum. Let's analyze the predicted spectrum for each compound and then see which combination matches the observed data.\n\n**1. Analyze the given ¹H NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ (All four options have this formula).\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue, suggesting high symmetry or no adjacent protons.\n\n**2.

They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* One 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H alkyl singlet.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This will result in three separate **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* One 2H aromatic singlet, three alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple and appear as a pair of **doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   *Conclusion:* This compound can be eliminated as it does not match the \"singlet\" description for the aromatic signals.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The ethyl groups would show characteristic splitting. The -CH₂- group would be a **quartet**, and the -CH₃ group would be a **triplet**.\n    *   *Conclusion:* This compound can be eliminated as it does not match the \"all singlets\" description for the alkyl signals.\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n\n*   Options A and D can be immediately eliminated because they contain 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   Option C can be eliminated because it contains 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nThis leaves only Option B. Let's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of the compounds in Option B matches the data.\n\n**4. Analyze the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Since these are different molecules, their aromatic protons will have slightly different chemical shifts. The result is **two singlets**. Because the mixture is 1:1 and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet with a relative intensity of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets with relative intensities of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 + 12 = 24H.\n    *   The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. For a total of 24 protons, these integrals correspond to:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   We can match these required signals (12H, 6H, 6H) with the signals from our compounds:\n        *   The 12H signal comes from the four equivalent methyl groups of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   The first 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   The second 6H signal must arise from the accidental overlap (accidental isochrony) of the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It is very plausible for these two signals to have identical or very similar chemical shifts.\n    *   This combination perfectly accounts for the observed three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to identify two compounds from a list of four based on the ¹H NMR spectrum of their 1:1 mixture.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   For an acyclic, saturated alkane, the formula would be C₁₀H₂₂(₂n+₂).\n    *   The degree of unsaturation = ( (2 * 10 + 2) - 14 ) / 2 = (22 - 14) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds). This is consistent with the compounds being aromatic.\n    *   Let's verify the formula for the options:\n        *   Tetramethylbenzene: C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₆H₂ + C₄H₁₂ = C₁₀H₁₄. Correct.\n        *   Diethylbenzene: C₆H₄(C₂H₅)₂ = C₆H₄ + C₄H₁₀ = C₁₀H₁₄. Correct.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. A singlet means an aromatic proton has no adjacent protons (H-C-C-H). The two singlets indicate two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and their equal ratio suggests that the two compounds contribute equally to these signals (since it's a 1:1 mixture).\n    *   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. Singlets for alkyl groups (like methyl) are common unless they are part of a larger, coupled system (like an ethyl group). Three signals mean there are three different chemical environments for the alkyl protons.\n\n3.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound:**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n        *   *Summary:* One aromatic singlet (2H), one alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through the C2-C5 axis.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n            1.  The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry -> **one singlet (6H)**.\n            2.  The methyl at C2 is unique -> **one singlet (3H)**.\n            3.  The methyl at C5 is unique -> **one singlet (3H)**.\n        *   *Summary:* One aromatic singlet (2H), three alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. They will be coupled and appear as **two doublets**, not singlets.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **not** in the mixture because the observed aromatic signals are singlets.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** An ethyl group consists of a -CH₂- group coupled to a -CH₃ group. This gives a characteristic quartet and triplet pattern, not singlets.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **not** in the mixture because the observed alkyl signals are all singlets.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Mixture Options:**\n\n    *   Based on the analysis above, both 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene are eliminated.\n    *   This eliminates options A, C, and D.\n    *   The only remaining possibility is **Option B**: a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if this combination matches the data.\n\n5.  **Verify Option B:**\n\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   In the mixture, we expect **two distinct singlets**. Since the molar ratio is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: one singlet of relative intensity 12H.\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: three singlets of relative intensities 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The problem states we observe **three signals** with a **2:1:1 ratio**. Let's see how this can happen. The total number of alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 + 12 = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrals of:\n            *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n            *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n            *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Let's match these required signals (12H, 6H, 6H) to our predicted signals:\n            *   The **12H** signal is from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n            *   The **6H** signal is from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n            *   The remaining **6H** signal must arise from the **accidental overlap** of the two 3H signals (from C2 and C5 methyls) of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   This combination gives three peaks with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.

    "This question asks us to identify two compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their combined ¹H NMR spectrum.

These are not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture\n\nSince 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene are eliminated, the mixture must consist of the other two compounds: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of these two would match the data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   A mixture of the two will show **two singlets**. Since the molar ratio is 1:1, the integration ratio of these two signals will be 2H:2H, or **1:1**. This perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: We get one singlet with a relative intensity of 12H.\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: We get three singlets with relative intensities of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states the mixture has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the integrals are 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This is explained by:\n        1.  The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        2.  The 6H singlet from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        3.  The two 3H singlets from the C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene overlapping (having the same chemical shift), creating a single 6H peak.\n    *   This gives a total of three peaks with a 12H:6H:6H ratio, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.

Predicting the Spectra of the Candidate Compounds\n\nLet's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** There are three distinct environments for the methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent: **one singlet (6H)**.\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n        (Total of 3 alkyl singlets).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They would couple and split each other into a pair of **doublets**. This contradicts the observation that all aromatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound cannot be in the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are coupled. The -CH₂- group would appear as a **quartet**, and the -CH₃- group as a **triplet**. This contradicts the observation that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound cannot be in the mixture.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Correct Mixture\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can eliminate 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. This means the mixture must consist of the remaining two compounds: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's verify this conclusion:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** A 1:1 mixture of these two compounds would show the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and the 2H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**, which matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The problem states we see three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. In our 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This is perfectly explained if:\n        1.  The 12H singlet is from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        2.  The 6H singlet is from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        3.  The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene happen to have the same chemical shift (accidental equivalence), appearing as a single combined 6H peak.\n    *   This gives three total signals with a 12H:6H:6H ratio, which simplifies to **2:1:1**, matching the data exactly.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds present in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
