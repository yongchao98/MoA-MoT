    "*   **Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n        *   The reaction is: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`.\n        *   This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n        *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This attack forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   To form the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated.\n        *   Reagent A's role is to provide this proton (H⁺). An acid is required for this step.\n        *   Looking at the options for A, we have `H3O+` and `NaHSO3`.\n        *   `H3O+` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acidic medium, which is a suitable source of protons for the final step.\n        *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) is used to form bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones, which is a different reaction and not what's happening here.\n        *   Therefore, reagent A must be `H3O+`. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the second reaction:**\n        *   The reaction is: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`.\n        *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   Nitrile hydrolysis is typically carried out under strong acidic or strong basic conditions with heating.\n        *   Reagent B, along with water, is the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n        *   We are left with options A and B. The choices for reagent B are `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) and `HCl` (hydrochloric acid).\n        *   `CH3COOH` is a weak acid. While it can technically catalyze the hydrolysis, it is not very effective, and the reaction would be extremely slow.\n        *   `HCl` is a strong acid and is a standard, effective reagent used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds efficiently in the presence of a strong acid like HCl and water upon heating.\n        *   Therefore, reagent B must be `HCl`.\n\n    3.  **Conclusion:**\n        *   From our analysis, A is `H3O+` and B is `HCl`.\n        *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

In this reaction, a ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with cyanide.\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   To obtain the final product, the negatively charged oxygen atom in the alkoxide intermediate must be protonated (gain an H⁺) to form the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Reagent A must therefore be a source of protons, i.e., an acid.\n    *   Looking at the options for A, we have `H3O+` and `NaHSO3`.\n    *   `H3O+` represents an acidic aqueous solution, which is a suitable proton source to complete the reaction.\n    *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) undergoes a different type of addition reaction with ketones and is not used to provide a proton in this context.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be H3O+**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile functional group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis is typically carried out under strong conditions, either with a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water, usually with heating.\n    *   We are choosing between `CH3COOH` (acetic acid, a weak acid) and `HCl` (hydrochloric acid, a strong acid) for reagent B.\n    *   For the hydrolysis of a nitrile to be efficient, a strong acid is required to catalyze the reaction. `HCl` is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for this purpose. `CH3COOH` is a weak acid and would not be effective enough to drive the reaction to completion in a reasonable time.\n    *   Therefore, **B must be HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A is `H3O+` and reagent B is `HCl`.

It reacts with the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n        *   The mechanism begins with the nucleophilic attack of the CN⁻ ion on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, creating a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n        *   To form the final product, `2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`, the negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated (gain a proton, H⁺) to become a neutral hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   Therefore, reagent A must be a source of protons, which is an acid.\n        *   Looking at the options for A, `H3O+` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acidic solution and is a suitable proton source. `NaHSO3` is sodium bisulfite and is used for forming bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction.\n        *   Thus, reagent **A must be H3O+**.

    "*   **Analysis of the First Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. A ketone (butan-2-one) is converted into a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the cyanide ion (`CN⁻`) from `NaCN` acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. Second, this negatively charged alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final neutral hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide a proton (H⁺) for the second step. Therefore, A must be an acid.\n    *   **Evaluating the Options for A:**\n        *   `H3O⁺`: This represents a hydronium ion in an aqueous acidic solution. It is a suitable source of protons for the reaction.\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: This is sodium bisulfite, which is used in a different addition reaction with carbonyls and is not an appropriate proton source here.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Reagent A must be `H3O⁺`. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile functional group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This process is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism/Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires a catalyst, water, and often heat. It can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B is the catalyst for the hydrolysis. We need to choose between `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) and `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) from the remaining options.\n    *   **Evaluating the Options for B:**\n        *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. It is not a strong enough catalyst to efficiently drive the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. Strong acids are required to facilitate the multiple steps of hydration and tautomerization that lead to the final carboxylic acid product.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Reagent B must be `HCl`.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A is `H3O⁺` and reagent B is `HCl`.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
