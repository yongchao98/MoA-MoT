    "This problem requires us to calculate the change in the population ratio of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in a star's photosphere when its effective temperature changes. The population ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation, assuming the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, an upper level (j) and a lower level (i), is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n-   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n-   E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels.\n-   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n-   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio N2/N1 as R(T).\nR(T) = (g2 / g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T))\n\n### 2. The Factor of Change\n\nWe are asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. Let's call this factor 'F'.\n\n-   T_nospots = 6000 K (temperature without spots)\n-   T_spots = 5500 K (effective temperature with spots)\n\nThe factor F is the ratio of the population ratios at these two temperatures:\n\nF = R(T_nospots) / R(T_spots)\n\nF = [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe statistical weight term (g2 / g1) cancels out:\n\nF = exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T_spots))\n\nUsing the property of exponents (exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)), we get:\n\nF = exp( [-(E2 - E1) / k * (1 / T_nospots)] - [-(E2 - E1) / k * (1 / T_spots)] )\nF = exp( (E2 - E1) / k * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) )\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy Difference (E2 - E1)\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å. The relationship is:\n\nE2 - E1 = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n-   h is the Planck constant.\n-   c is the speed of light.\n-   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\nSo, the expression for the factor F becomes:\n\nF = exp( (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) )\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\nNow we plug in the values and calculate F. We can use a Python script for precision.\n\n**Variables:**\n-   λ = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n-   T_spots = 5500 K\n-   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\n**Constants:**\n-   h (Planck constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n-   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n-   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nThe extraneous information (stellar radius, mass, spot coverage percentage) is not needed for this specific calculation, as the initial and final effective temperatures of the photosphere are given.\n\nLet's execute the calculation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk_B = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nwavelength_angstrom = 1448\nwavelength_meters = wavelength_angstrom * 1e-10\nT_nospots = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in Kelvin\nT_spots = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (E2 - E1) from the wavelength\nenergy_difference = h * c / wavelength_meters\n\n# Calculate the factor F = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots\n# This simplifies to exp( (E2 - E1 / k_B) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) )\nexponent = (energy_difference / k_B) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n4.50\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms over various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this equation is applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n-   **g₂** and **g₁** are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the upper and lower levels, respectively.\n-   **ΔE** is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n-   **k** is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n-   **T** is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Ratio of Ratios\n\nWe are asked to find the factor by which this population ratio changes. Let's define the population ratio at a given temperature T as R(T).\n\n-   The ratio without spots (T₁ = 6000 K) is: R(T₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n-   The ratio with spots (T₂ = 5500 K) is: R(T₂) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio of R(T₁) to R(T₂):\n\nFactor = R(T₁) / R(T₂) = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nUsing the exponent rule exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b), we get:\n\nFactor = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T₁)] - [-ΔE / (k * T₂)] )\nFactor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) )\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the transition wavelength λ = 1448 Å. We can calculate this using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n-   **h** is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n-   **c** is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n-   **λ** is the wavelength, which must be in meters: 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\n\nWe now have all the components to calculate the factor.
