    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the State and Parameters\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n\nWe are given the specific parameters:\n*   `phi = -pi / 4`\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n\nFirst, let's determine the specific form of the state `|psi>` for `phi = -pi / 4`.\n*   `cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`\n\nSubstituting these into the state equation:\n`|psi> = ( (1/sqrt(2))|alpha> - (1/sqrt(2))|-alpha> ) / N = (|alpha> - |-alpha>) / (sqrt(2) * N)`\n\nNow, let's calculate the normalization constant `N`.\n`N^2 = 1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2)`\n`sin(2*phi) = sin(2 * -pi/4) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`\n`N^2 = 1 - exp(-2*alpha^2)`\n\nSubstituting this back into the state expression:\n`|psi> = (|alpha> - |-alpha>) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - exp(-2*alpha^2))) = (|alpha> - |-alpha>) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-2*alpha^2)))`\nThis state is a pure quantum state, specifically an \"odd cat state\".\n\n### 2. Understanding the Non-Gaussianity Measure\n\nThe non-Gaussianity (nG) is given by the relative entropy `del_b = S(rho || tau)`. The standard definition, consistent with the provided formula, is:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\nwhere:\n*   `S(sigma) = -trace(sigma * ln(sigma))` is the von Neumann entropy.\n*   `rho = |psi><psi|` is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state.\n*   `tau` is the reference Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n\nSince `|psi>` is a pure state, its density matrix `rho` has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all others equal to 0. The entropy of any pure state is:\n`S(rho) = - (1 * ln(1) + 0 * ln(0) + ...) = 0`\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### 3. Finding the Reference Gaussian State `tau`\n\nTo find `S(tau)`, we first need to characterize `tau`. A Gaussian state is completely defined by its first moments (displacement vector) and second moments (covariance matrix). `tau` must match these moments with `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** `d = <a> = <psi|a|psi>`\n    Let's calculate this (assuming `alpha` is real):\n    `a|psi> = (a|alpha> - a|-alpha>) / C = (alpha|alpha> - (-alpha)|-alpha>) / C = alpha(|alpha> + |-alpha>) / C` (where C is the normalization denominator)\n    `<a> = (1/C^2) * (<alpha| - <-alpha|) * (alpha(|alpha> + |-alpha>))`\n    `<a> = (alpha/C^2) * [ <alpha|alpha> + <alpha|-alpha> - <-alpha|alpha> - <-alpha|-alpha> ]`\n    Using the overlap `<beta|gamma> = exp(-0.5|beta|^2 - 0.5|gamma|^2 + beta* * gamma)`, we get `<alpha|-alpha> = <-alpha|alpha> = exp(-2*alpha^2)`.\n    `<a> = (alpha/C^2) * [ 1 + exp(-2*alpha^2) - exp(-2*alpha^2) - 1 ] = 0`\n    The displacement is zero, so `tau` is a centered Gaussian state (a squeezed thermal state).\n\n*   **Second Moments:** A centered Gaussian state is defined by the average photon number `n = <a^†a>` and the squeezing parameter `m = <a^2>`.\n    *   **Calculating `m = <a^2>`:**\n        `a^2|psi> = a(alpha(|alpha> + |-alpha>)/C) = (alpha/C) * (a|alpha> + a|-alpha>) = (alpha/C) * (alpha|alpha> - alpha|-alpha>) = (alpha^2/C) * (|alpha> - |-alpha>) = alpha^2|psi>`\n        `<a^2> = <psi|a^2|psi> = <psi|alpha^2|psi> = alpha^2 <psi|psi> = alpha^2`\n        So, `m = alpha^2`.\n\n    *   **Calculating `n = <a^†a>`:**\n        We use `<a^†a> = <a*psi|a*psi>` (inner product).\n        `|a*psi> = alpha(|alpha> + |-alpha>) / C`\n        `<n> = (alpha^2/C^2) * (<alpha| + <-alpha|) (|alpha> + |-alpha>)`\n        `<n> = (alpha^2/C^2) * [ 1 + exp(-2a^2) + exp(-2a^2) + 1 ] = (2*alpha^2/C^2) * (1 + exp(-2a^2))`\n        Substituting `C^2 = 2 * (1 - exp(-2a^2))`:\n        `<n> = (2*alpha^2 / (2*(1-exp(-2a^2)))) * (1 + exp(-2a^2)) = alpha^2 * (1 + exp(-2*alpha^2)) / (1 - exp(-2*alpha^2))`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Entropy of `tau`\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode centered Gaussian state `tau` is given by:\n`S(tau) = (v + 1/2)ln(v + 1/2) - (v - 1/2)ln(v - 1/2)`\nwhere `v` is the symplectic eigenvalue, related to `n` and `m` by:\n`v^2 = (n + 1/2)^2 - |m|^2`\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation\n\nNow we plug in the numbers using a Python script.\n`alpha = 0.5`\n`alpha^2 = 0.25`\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Problem Parameters\nalpha = 0.5\n\n# Calculate moments for the reference Gaussian state tau\nalpha_sq = alpha**2\nexp_val = np.exp(-2 * alpha_sq)\n\n# m = <a^2>\nm = alpha_sq\n\n# n = <a^dag a>\nn = alpha_sq * (1 + exp_val) / (1 - exp_val)\n\n# Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue v\nv_sq = (n + 0.5)**2 - m**2\nv = np.sqrt(v_sq)\n\n# Calculate the entropy S(tau), which is the non-Gaussianity nG\n# S(tau) = (v + 0.5) * ln(v + 0.5) - (v - 0.5) * ln(v - 0.5)\nterm1 = (v + 0.5) * np.log(v + 0.5)\nterm2 = (v - 0.5) * np.log(v - 0.5)\nnG = term1 - term2\n\nprint(f\"{nG:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n1.39\n<<<\n\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity (nG) is approximately 1.39.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to determine the amount of non-Gaussianity.\n\n### 1. Simplify the State Vector\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n\nWe are given the parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`. Let's substitute these into the state expression:\n*   `cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2`\n*   `sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\n\nSo, the state vector becomes:\n`|psi> = ( (1/√2)|alpha> - (1/√2)|-alpha> ) / N = (|alpha> - |-alpha>) / (√2 * N)`\n\nThe normalization constant `N` is given by `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2))`.\n*   `sin(2*phi) = sin(2 * -pi/4) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25`\n*   `N^2 = 1 - exp(-2 * 0.25) = 1 - exp(-0.5)`\n\nThe denominator `(√2 * N)` squared is `2 * N^2 = 2 * (1 - exp(-0.5))`. This corresponds to the correct normalization factor for the state `|alpha> - |-alpha>`, which is known as an \"odd cat state\".\nSo, `rho = |psi><psi|` represents a pure quantum state.\n\n### 2. Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure\n\nThe non-Gaussianity measure is the relative entropy between the state `rho` and its reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(rho || tau)`\n\nThe problem provides the formula `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]`. Let's relate this to the von Neumann entropy, `S(σ) = -trace(σ ln σ)`.\n`del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\nThis is a well-known result for this measure: the non-Gaussianity `nG` is the difference between the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau` and the entropy of the state `rho` itself.\n\nSince `|psi>` is a pure state, its density matrix `rho` has one eigenvalue of 1 and all others of 0. The entropy of any pure state is:\n`S(rho) = - (1 * ln(1)) = 0`\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### 3. Determine the Reference Gaussian State `tau`\n\nThe reference Gaussian state `tau` is the unique Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):**\n    The average amplitude `<a> = <psi|a|psi>` is zero due to the symmetry of the odd cat state. This can be explicitly calculated: `<a> = 0`. This means `tau` is a centered Gaussian state (a squeezed thermal state).\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):**\n    A centered Gaussian state is defined by two parameters: the average photon number `n_ph = <a†a>` and the squeezing parameter `m = <a^2>`.\n    1.  **Squeezing parameter `m`:**\n        For the odd cat state, `m = <psi|a^2|psi> = alpha^2`.\n        With `alpha = 0.5`, `m = 0.5^2 = 0.25`.\n    2.  **Average photon number `n_ph`:**\n        For the odd cat state, `n_ph = <psi|a†a|psi> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n        `n_ph = 0.25 * coth(0.25) = 0.25 * (exp(0.25) + exp(-0.25)) / (exp(0.25) - exp(-0.25))`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Entropy of `tau`\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of a single-mode centered Gaussian state `tau` is given by:\n`S(tau) = (v + 1/2)ln(v + 1/2) - (v - 1/2)ln(v - 1/2)`\nwhere `v` is the symplectic eigenvalue, which is determined by the moments `n_ph` and `m`:\n`v^2 = (n_ph + 1/2)^2 - |m|^2`\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the numerical calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the parameter alpha\nalpha = 0.5\n\n# Calculate the second moments of the state\nalpha_sq = alpha**2\nm = alpha_sq  # Squeezing parameter <a^2>\n\n# Calculate n_ph = <a^dagger a> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)\nn_ph = alpha_sq * (np.exp(alpha_sq) + np.exp(-alpha_sq)) / (np.exp(alpha_sq) - np.exp(-alpha_sq))\n\n# Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue v\nv_sq = (n_ph + 0.5)**2 - np.abs(m)**2\nv = np.sqrt(v_sq)\n\n# Calculate the entropy of the reference Gaussian state S(tau), which equals the non-Gaussianity nG\n# S(tau) = (v + 0.5) * ln(v + 0.5) - (v - 0.5) * ln(v - 0.5)\nterm1 = (v + 0.5) * np.log(v + 0.5)\nterm2 = (v - 0.5) * np.log(v - 0.5)\nnG = term1 - term2\n\nprint(f\"{nG:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n1.39\n<<<The calculation yields a non-Gaussianity value of approximately `1.386`, which rounds to `1.39`.

For the odd cat state, these moments are given by well-established formulas:\n    *   `n = <a†a> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n    *   `m = <a^2> = alpha^2`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `tau`\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode centered Gaussian state `tau` is calculated in two steps:\n1.  Find the symplectic eigenvalue `v` using the moments `n` and `m`:\n    `v^2 = (n + 1/2)^2 - |m|^2`\n\n2.  Calculate the entropy using the formula:\n    `S(tau) = (v + 1/2)ln(v + 1/2) - (v - 1/2)ln(v - 1/2)`\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation\n\nWe have `alpha = 0.5`. Let's plug this into the formulas.\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25`\n*   `m = alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `n = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2) = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n\nWe can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the parameter alpha\nalpha = 0.5\n\n# Calculate the square of alpha\nalpha_sq = alpha**2\n\n# Calculate the second moments, n and m, for the odd cat state.\n# m is the squeezing parameter\nm = alpha_sq\n\n# n is the average photon number\n# coth(x) = 1/tanh(x)\nn = alpha_sq / np.tanh(alpha_sq)\n\n# Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue v for the reference state tau\nv_sq = (n + 0.5)**2 - np.abs(m)**2\nv = np.sqrt(v_sq)\n\n# The non-Gaussianity nG is the entropy of the reference state S(tau)\n# S(tau) = (v + 0.5) * ln(v + 0.5) - (v - 0.5) * ln(v - 0.5)\nterm1 = (v + 0.5) * np.log(v + 0.5)\nterm2 = (v - 0.5) * np.log(v - 0.5)\nnG = term1 - term2\n\n# Print the final result\n# The calculation gives ~1.386, which is very close to 1.38 and rounds to 1.39\nprint(f\"{nG:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n1.39\n<<<\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`. When rounded to two decimal places, this is `1.39`.\n\nComparing this result to the options provided:\nA) 2.48\nB) 1.38\nC) 0.25\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated value of `1.386` is extremely close to `1.38`. The small difference (less than 0.5%) is acceptable and likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
