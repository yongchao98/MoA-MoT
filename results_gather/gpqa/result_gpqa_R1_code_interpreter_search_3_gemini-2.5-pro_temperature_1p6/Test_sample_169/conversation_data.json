    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the expectation value of the spin operator in the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`, for a given spin state.\n\n2.  **State the Formula:** The expectation value of an operator `A` for a quantum state `|ψ>` is given by the formula:\n    `<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n    In our case, the operator `A` is `S_y`, so we need to calculate:\n    `<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n\n3.  **Define the Components of the Formula:**\n    *   **The spin state (ket vector) `|ψ>`:** The state is given as `(3i, 4)`. We write this as a column vector:\n        `|ψ> = [ 3i ]`\n              `[ 4  ]`\n    *   **The bra vector `<ψ|`:** This is the conjugate transpose (also known as the Hermitian conjugate) of the ket vector `|ψ>`.\n        -   First, take the complex conjugate of each element: `3i` becomes `-3i`, and the real number `4` remains `4`.\n        -   Then, take the transpose of the column vector to get a row vector.\n        `<ψ| = [ -3i, 4 ]`\n    *   **The spin operator `S_y`:** The spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices (`σ`) by the equation `S_k = (ħ/2)σ_k` for k = x, y, z. We are given the Pauli-y matrix `σ_y`:\n        `σ_y = [ 0  -i ]`\n              `[ i   0 ]`\n        Therefore, the spin operator `S_y` is:\n        `S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]`\n                       `[ i   0 ]`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the denominator `<ψ|ψ>` (the normalization factor).**\n        This is the inner product of the state with itself.\n        `<ψ|ψ> = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ 3i ]`\n                              `[ 4  ]`\n        `<ψ|ψ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n        `<ψ|ψ> = -9(i²) + 16`\n        Since `i² = -1`, the expression becomes:\n        `<ψ|ψ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`.**\n        It is often easier to first apply the operator to the ket vector (`S_y|ψ>`) and then take the inner product with the bra vector (`<ψ|`).\n\n        *   **First, find `S_y|ψ>`:**\n            `S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n                           `[ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n            Perform the matrix-vector multiplication:\n            `[ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ] = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = [ -4i ]`\n            `[ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`   `[ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)   ]   [ 3i² ]`\n            Again, using `i² = -1`, `3i² = -3`.
