    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System Properties:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by both its spatial quantum number (n) and its spin quantum number (m_s).\n    *   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   **Spin States:** For spin-1/2 particles, there are two possible spin states: spin up (m_s = +1/2) and spin down (m_s = -1/2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because of the two possible spin states, each energy level `n` of the potential well can hold a maximum of two particles (one with spin up, one with spin down).\n\n2.  **Determine the Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle of mass `m` in a 1D infinite potential well of length `L` are given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n        where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The problem conveniently defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n        E_n = n² * E\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   The ground state is the lowest possible total energy state for the system. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with our four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   **Level n=1:** We place the first two fermions in this level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed by these two particles is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1² * E) = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two fermions in this level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed by these two particles is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies of all four particles.\n        E_ground = 2E₁ + 2E₂ = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_first_excited):**\n    *   The first excited state corresponds to the lowest possible energy greater than the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   **Ground state configuration:** Particles occupy levels n=1 and n=2.\n    *   **Excitation:** Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   **First excited state configuration:**\n        *   Two particles in level n=1 (Energy: 2 * E₁ = 2E)\n        *   One particle in level n=2 (Energy: 1 * E₂ = 4E)\n        *   One particle in level n=3 (Energy: 1 * E₃ = 1 * (3² * E) = 9E)\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        E_first_excited = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_second_excited):**\n    *   The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n    *   We have already found the first excited state energy is 15E. Let's find other possible excitation energies and identify the next lowest one.\n    *   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   **Comparing the excited state energies:** The ground state is 10E. The possible excited state energies are 15E, 18E, 20E, and so on.\n    *   The lowest energy above the ground state is 15E (the first excited state).\n    *   The next lowest energy is 18E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** E_second_excited = 18E.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
