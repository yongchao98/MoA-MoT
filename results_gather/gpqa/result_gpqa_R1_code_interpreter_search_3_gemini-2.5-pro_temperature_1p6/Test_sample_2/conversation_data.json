    "An elegant and systematic way to solve this problem is by using linear algebra and the principles of quantum mechanics. Here is a step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the State Vector**: The problem states that the spin-half particle is in a linear superposition given by the state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`. In quantum mechanics, the basis states `|↑⟩` (spin-up) and `|↓⟩` (spin-down) are represented by column vectors.\n    *   `|↑⟩` corresponds to the vector `[1, 0]ᵀ`.\n    *   `|↓⟩` corresponds to the vector `[0, 1]ᵀ`.\n\n    Therefore, the state vector `|ψ⟩` can be written in matrix form as:\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]ᵀ + (√3/2) * [0, 1]ᵀ = [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ`.\n\n2.  **Define the Operators**: The problem involves the Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x`. Their standard matrix representations in the `σ_z` basis (`|↑⟩`, `|↓⟩`) are:\n    *   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\n    The operator whose expectation value we need to find is `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. We can construct the matrix for this operator:\n    `O = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    `O = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\n    `O = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value**: The expectation value of an operator `O` for a given state `|ψ⟩` is calculated using the formula `⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`.\n\n    *   First, we need the \"bra\" vector `⟨ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" vector `|ψ⟩`. Since the components of `|ψ⟩` are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose:\n        `⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\n    *   Now, we can perform the matrix multiplication `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. It's often easier to first calculate `O|ψ⟩`:\n        `O|ψ⟩ = [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ`\n        `O|ψ⟩ = [(10 * 0.5) + (5 * √3/2), (5 * 0.5) + (-10 * √3/2)]ᵀ`\n        `O|ψ⟩ = [5 + 2.5√3, 2.5 - 5√3]ᵀ`\n\n    *   Finally, we multiply `⟨ψ|` by the resulting vector `O|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [5 + 2.5√3, 2.5 - 5√3]ᵀ`\n        `⟨O⟩ = 0.5 * (5 + 2.5√3) + (√3/2) * (2.5 - 5√3)`\n        `⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 1.25√3 + 1.25√3 - (5*3)/2`\n        `⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 2.5√3 - 7.5`\n        `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**: To get the final numerical answer, we use the value of `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n    `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n    `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 4.33`\n    `⟨O⟩ = -0.67`\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: The calculated expectation value is approximately -0.67. Rounding to one decimal place, we get -0.7. This corresponds to option C.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the arithmetic, especially with matrix operations, a simple Python script can be used for verification.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the state vector |ψ⟩\n# |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩\npsi = np.array([0.5, np.sqrt(3)/2])\n\n# Define the Pauli matrices\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n\n# Define the operator O\nO = 10 * sigma_z + 5 * sigma_x\n\n# The state vector |ψ⟩ as a column vector for matrix multiplication\npsi_ket = psi.reshape(2, 1)\n\n# The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of the ket\npsi_bra = psi_ket.conj().T\n\n# Calculate the expectation value ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩\nexpectation_value = np.dot(psi_bra, np.dot(O, psi_ket))\n\n# The result is a 1x1 matrix, so we extract the scalar value\nresult = expectation_value[0, 0]\n\n# Print the result rounded to one decimal place\nprint(f\"{result:.1f}\")\n```\n-0.7\n\nThe code confirms the manually calculated result.
