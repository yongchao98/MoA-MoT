    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to completely disrupt the function of this gene, which means creating a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Understanding Gene Expression and Mutations:**\n    1.  The DNA sequence of a gene is first transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA).\n    2.  The mRNA is then translated into a protein. The translation process reads the mRNA in three-nucleotide units called codons.\n    3.  Translation starts at the `ATG` start codon and continues until it reaches a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`).\n    4.  A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence. The impact of a mutation depends on how it affects the final protein.\n        *   **Silent Mutation:** The change in a codon does not change the resulting amino acid. No effect on the protein.\n        *   **Missense Mutation:** The change in a codon results in a different amino acid. This may or may not affect protein function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid.\n        *   **Nonsense Mutation:** The change in a codon creates a premature stop codon. This leads to the production of a shortened (truncated) and usually non-functional protein.\n        *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons, altering every subsequent amino acid and usually leading to a premature stop codon, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Gene and Mutants:**\n    Let's break down the intact gene's initial sequence into codons and translate it. The genetic code will tell us what amino acid each codon represents.\n\n    **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   `ATG`: Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC`: Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT`: Alanine (Ala)\n    *   **Protein sequence:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-...\n\n    Now let's examine each mutant in the same way.\n\n    **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` changes to `TAC`. `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr).\n    *   **Change:** Leucine (Leu) is replaced by Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**. The resulting protein has one amino acid changed. It might still be functional.\n    *   **Protein sequence:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-...\n\n    **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC` (silent mutation, Phe -> Phe).\n    *   The third codon `CTC` changes to `TAA`. **`TAA` is a stop codon.**\n    *   **Change:** Translation will stop prematurely after the second amino acid. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Protein sequence:** Met-Phe. The resulting protein is only two amino acids long and will be completely non-functional. This is the most likely candidate to eliminate the synthesis of the compound.\n\n    **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` changes to `TAC`. This is a missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   The sixth codon `ACT` changes to `GTC`. This is another missense mutation (Thr -> Val).\n    *   **Change:** The protein will have two amino acids changed. While this is more disruptive than Mutant 1, it is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing to the intact sequence `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`, we can see two changes:\n        1.  A missense mutation: the third codon `CTC` (Leu) is changed to `TAC` (Tyr).\n        2.  A deletion: the fifth codon `GGT` is completely missing. A deletion of three bases removes one amino acid without changing the reading frame (an in-frame deletion).\n    *   **Change:** The protein has one amino acid changed (missense) and is missing another one (in-frame deletion). This will likely affect protein structure and function, but it is not as certain to cause complete loss of function as a premature stop codon very early in the sequence.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    To eliminate the compound, the goal is to create a knockout mutation that completely destroys the protein's function. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) that introduces a stop codon near the very beginning of the gene is the most effective and reliable way to achieve this, as it prevents the synthesis of almost the entire protein.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that eliminates an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective way to eliminate the compound is to create a mutation that renders the protein non-functional (a \"knockout\" mutation).\n\n*   **Analysis of Gene Translation:** Protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon (start codon) and continues by reading the DNA sequence in groups of three called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. This process stops when a \"stop codon\" (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`) is reached.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Mutations:** To find the most effective mutation, we need to translate the initial part of each gene sequence into its amino acid sequence and see how the mutation affects the final protein.\n\n    1.  **Intact Gene:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Translation:\n            *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n            *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n            *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n        *   Initial Protein: Met-Phe-Leu-...\n\n    2.  **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid in the protein. The resulting protein might have reduced function or be unaffected; it is not guaranteed to be non-functional.\n        *   Initial Protein: Met-Phe-Tyr-...\n\n    3.  **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. When the ribosome encounters this codon, it will stop translation.\n        *   Result: Only a very short peptide (Met-Phe) will be produced. A protein this severely truncated at the very beginning of its sequence will be completely non-functional. This will reliably prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n    4.  **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’` (as interpreted from the messy sequence provided, this is the most likely intended change)\n        *   Changes: This mutant contains at least two missense mutations compared to the intact gene (`CTC`->`TAC` and `ACT`->`GTC`).\n        *   Mutation Type: Multiple **missense mutations**. While this is more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is still not guaranteed to completely eliminate protein function.\n\n    5.  **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Changes: This sequence has changed `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr) and deleted the entire `GGT` codon (Glycine).\n        *   Mutation Type: This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (deletion of exactly 3 nucleotides). The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another one changed. This is very likely to disrupt function, but it's possible some function could remain.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the choices, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and most certain to result in a completely non-functional protein. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it prevents the synthesis of virtually the entire protein. This makes it the most probable mutation to achieve the goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a problem of molecular genetics. The goal is to find a mutation that will most likely lead to the production of a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of an unwanted compound. To solve this, we must analyze the type of mutation in each mutant line and predict its effect on the protein.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Gene Expression**\n- A gene's DNA sequence is transcribed into mRNA.\n- The mRNA is read in three-base units called codons.\n- Translation starts at the start codon (`ATG`, which codes for Methionine) and stops at a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`).\n- A mutation that creates a premature stop codon (a **nonsense mutation**) or shifts the entire reading frame (a **frameshift mutation**) is most likely to produce a non-functional, truncated protein. A mutation that only changes one amino acid (a **missense mutation**) might not be sufficient to completely destroy protein function.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene's Sequence**\nLet's break the start of the intact gene into codons to establish a baseline:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n- Codon 1: `ATG` (Methionine, Start)\n- Codon 2: `TTT` (Phenylalanine)\n- Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine)\n- Codon 4: `GCT` (Alanine)\n- ...and so on.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    - Comparison: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    - Mutation Type: This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this can sometimes disable a protein, it's not guaranteed. The protein might still be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    - Comparison: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    - Mutation Type: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will terminate at this point.\n    - Result: Only a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Methionine-Phenylalanine) will be made. A protein truncated this early is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCTGGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    - Comparison: This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` is changed to `TAC` (Leucine -> Tyrosine) and `ACT` is changed to `GTC` (Threonine -> Valine).\n    - Mutation Type: This represents two separate **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon for knocking out function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    - Comparison with intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    - The sequence shows that the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    - Mutation Type: This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly 3 bases, which removes an amino acid without shifting the reading frame). While this is a major change that will likely disrupt protein structure and function, it is not as guaranteed to cause complete loss of function as the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nTo eliminate the function of a gene, the most effective mutation is one that prevents the creation of a full-length protein. A nonsense mutation (creating a premature stop codon) is the most reliable way to achieve this. Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position in the coding sequence, ensuring that only a useless two-amino-acid fragment is produced. This is the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot carry out its role in synthesizing the compound. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence.\n\nThe process of creating a protein from a gene is called translation, where the DNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. This process starts at the `ATG` codon and ends when a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`) is reached.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Sequence Analysis**\n\nLet's break the start of the intact gene into its codons:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ...-3’`\n- `ATG`: Codes for Methionine (this is the Start codon).\n- `TTT`: Codes for Phenylalanine.\n- `CTC`: Codes for Leucine.\n- The protein begins: Met-Phe-Leu-...\n\n**2. Mutant Analysis**\n\n*   **Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’**\n    - The original third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    - This type of mutation, which substitutes one amino acid for another, is called a **missense mutation**. The resulting protein is full-length but has one amino acid changed. This might reduce or alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’**\n    - The original third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n    - The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n    - When the cellular machinery encounters this stop codon, it will terminate protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting product would only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). Such a severely truncated protein is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCTGGT GTC ACT...-3’**\n    - This sequence appears to have multiple single-nucleotide changes, resulting in at least two **missense mutations** (e.g., `CTC` to `TAC`, and `ACT` to `GTC`). While multiple amino acid changes are more likely to disrupt function than a single change, it's still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’**\n    - Comparing this to the intact gene reveals two changes: a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    - A deletion of three nucleotides is an **in-frame deletion**, meaning one amino acid is removed from the protein without shifting the rest of the sequence. This is a significant structural change but, like a missense mutation, does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate a protein's function is to prevent it from being made in its full length. The **nonsense mutation** in **Mutant 2** introduces a stop codon very early in the gene sequence. This will halt protein synthesis and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide. This is the most certain way among the given options to knock out the gene's function and thereby eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To identify the mutation that is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. A protein's function is dictated by its three-dimensional structure, which is determined by its sequence of amino acids. Let's analyze the genetic changes in each mutant.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the genetic code and translation**\nThe genetic code is read in three-base units called codons. Translation starts at the `ATG` codon and stops when one of three stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`) is reached. A mutation that creates a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) is the most likely to produce a severely truncated and non-functional protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nFirst, let's break down the beginning of the intact gene into codons:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n- `ATG`: This is the start codon, coding for the amino acid Methionine (Met).\n- `TTT`: Codes for Phenylalanine (Phe).\n- `CTC`: Codes for Leucine (Leu).\nThe protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-...\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each mutant sequence**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, meaning it swaps one amino acid for another. While this can affect protein function, it does not guarantee the protein will be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. This mutation causes the protein synthesis to stop after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting protein product will be extremely short (only Met-Phe) and completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’` (based on the provided string)\n    This mutant contains multiple changes, including at least one missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`). Like Mutant 1, it results in amino acid substitutions, which may or may not eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    This sequence contains a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the three nucleotides `GGT` further downstream. This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. While this will certainly alter the protein's structure by changing one amino acid and removing another, it's not as certain to cause complete loss-of-function as the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon very early in the gene's coding sequence. This leads to the production of a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most definitive way to \"knock out\" the gene's function and therefore is the most probable to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
