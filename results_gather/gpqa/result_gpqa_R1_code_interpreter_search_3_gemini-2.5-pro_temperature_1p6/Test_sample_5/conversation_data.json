    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThis potential couples the r and θ coordinates, making it difficult to solve the Schrödinger equation directly in polar coordinates. However, the terms `r^2` and `r^2 cos^2(θ)` suggest that converting to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) might simplify the problem.\n\n**2. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these, we can see that:\n*   r^2 cos^2(θ) = (r cos(θ))^2 = x^2\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\n\nGroup the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**3. Recognize the Separable Potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis is the potential for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent 1D Schrödinger equations, one for the x-motion and one for the y-motion.\n\n**4. Solve the 1D Schrödinger Equations**\n\nThe standard potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2, and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    We compare V_x(x) = 2kx^2 with the standard form 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2.\n    1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n    mω_x^2 = 4k\n    ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    We compare V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2 with the standard form 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2.\n    1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n    mω_y^2 = k\n    ω_y^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**5. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E of the 2D system is the sum of the energies from the independent x and y motions:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThis expression gives the energy spectrum, where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur derived energy spectrum E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m) matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>",

    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Transform the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe problem is given in polar coordinates (r, θ), which makes it appear complex because the variables are coupled. The key is to convert the potential V(r, θ) into Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\nThe relationships are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these, we can identify a key term in the potential:\n*   r^2 cos^2(θ) = (r cos(θ))^2 = x^2\n\nNow substitute these into the given potential:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\n\nGroup the x and y terms separately:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**2.
