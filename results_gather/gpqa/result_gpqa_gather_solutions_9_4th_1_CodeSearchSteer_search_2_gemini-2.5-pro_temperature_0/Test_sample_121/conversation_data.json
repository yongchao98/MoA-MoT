The structure of the product from each step is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:** This is a tandem dialkylation and cyclization. The key is the use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base.\n    *   First, NaH removes one of the acidic protons from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano and ester groups).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing a bromide ion.\n    *   The excess NaH then removes the second, and now only, proton on that α-carbon.\n    *   This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to displace the second bromide ion, forming a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The observed ¹H NMR spectrum is a time-average of these conformations.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1. Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same CH₂ group are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid rotation, they are chemically distinct (diastereotopic). This is a crucial concept for cyclohexane rings, where axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Proton Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (e.g., C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get the total number of observable signals:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis result is confirmed by all 15 candidate answers, which, despite using slightly different analytical models, all converge on the same number. The number 8 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product of the four-step synthesis. All candidate answers unanimously and correctly identified the reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid undergoes α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction) with Br₂, pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 undergoes Fischer esterification with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 undergoes an Sₙ2 reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN), where the cyanide nucleophile displaces the bromide.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 undergoes a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base ensures both acidic α-protons are used for two successive alkylations, the second of which is an intramolecular ring closure.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key principles.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring is not static; it undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure resulting from this rapid flipping.\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid flipping creates an *effective plane of symmetry* in the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group. Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon atom (geminal protons) are not always equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by symmetry or rotation, they are diastereotopic and give rise to separate NMR signals. This is particularly important for the protons on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nBased on the principles above, we can systematically count the signals.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Subtotal for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Subtotal for cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of distinct hydrogen signals is the sum of the signals from each part of the molecule:\n\nTotal Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from cyclohexane ring) = **8**\n\nThis result is robust, as more rigorous analyses that account for the molecule's inherent chirality also converge on the same answer of 8 signals. All the provided candidate answers correctly performed this analysis and arrived at the number 8.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 12\nC) 8\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the information from all candidate answers to establish a consensus on the chemical reasoning.

The structure of the final product is determined by following this sequence:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a sulfuric acid catalyst is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The use of *excess* NaH is crucial. It ensures the second, remaining proton on the α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   The resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4):** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Careful Points for NMR Analysis:**\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure.\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis result is confirmed by a more rigorous analysis that considers the molecule's inherent chirality, which also leads to 8 signals. The calculated number of signals is 8. Matching this to the provided options:\n\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 8\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe synthesis involves four sequential reactions. All candidate answers correctly identified the product of each step, and their consensus is accurate.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.

This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization reaction. The strong base (NaH) first deprotonates the acidic α-carbon. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base removes the second α-proton, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack to close a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4):** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.

In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other.

The unanimous consensus from all 15 candidate answers confirms this result.\n\nMatching the calculated number of signals (8) to the provided options:\nA) 10\nB) 8\nC) 12\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an α-bromination reaction, analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification, converting the carboxylic acid into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a straightforward Sₙ2 nucleophilic substitution where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic due to being flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt). The use of **excess** NaH is critical; it ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two separate alkylation steps. The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The second deprotonation is followed by an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe second step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Dynamics.** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Molecular Symmetry.** The rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry for the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the carbon opposite it), the cyano group, and the ester group. Protons that can be interchanged by reflection through this plane are chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereotopicity.** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent.\n    *   In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are **diastereotopic** and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   The effective symmetry plane can make pairs of protons on different carbons equivalent (e.g., the axial proton on C2 becomes equivalent to the axial proton on C6).\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\nBased on the time-averaged structure with its effective plane of symmetry:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation.

In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThe number of observable hydrogen signals is 8. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, incorporating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly trace the four-step synthesis. The process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**: The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an **α-bromination**, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**: The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and sulfuric acid is a **Fischer esterification**, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**: The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a **nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2)**, where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**: The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a **tandem alkylation-cyclization**. The excess NaH ensures both acidic protons on the central carbon are used in two successive alkylations, leading to the formation of a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key principles.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry and Stereotopicity**: The final product has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on carbon C1. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole is chiral. This lack of true symmetry means that protons on the same CH₂ group (geminal protons) are often diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n*   **Analytical Models**: As shown in the candidate answers, there are two valid models for analyzing this molecule, both of which reassuringly lead to the same conclusion.\n\n    *   **Model A (The \"Effective Symmetry Plane\" Approach):** This common textbook method assumes that rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n        *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent (1 signal). The two -OCH₂- protons are enantiotopic due to the effective plane and are equivalent in an achiral solvent (1 signal). Total = **2 signals**.\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring:** The plane makes C2/C6 and C3/C5 equivalent pairs. On each pair, the axial-like and equatorial-like protons are distinct. The protons on C4 are also distinct from each other. This gives 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **6 signals**.\n        *   **Total (Model A): 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\n    *   **Model B (The \"Rigorous Chirality\" Approach):** This model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral from the start.\n        *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent (1 signal). The two -OCH₂- protons are adjacent to a chiral center, making them diastereotopic and thus distinct (2 signals). Total = **3 signals**.\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring:** The lack of symmetry means all five CH₂ groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments. Rapid flipping averages the axial and equatorial protons for each carbon, resulting in **5 distinct signals** for the five unique CH₂ groups.\n        *   **Total (Model B): 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth chemically sound methods of analysis converge on the same result: there are **8** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product. All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at this number.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 12\nD) 5\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence. All candidate answers have correctly deduced this sequence.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst (pyridine/acetic anhydride) is an α-bromination, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction. This yields **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. This yields **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide. This yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The acidic protons on the carbon between the -CN and -COOEt groups are removed sequentially by excess sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanions react first with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane and then intramolecularly with the other end to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of molecular symmetry and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to this rapid flipping, the molecule possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry for NMR purposes. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid rotation, they are diastereotopic and give distinct NMR signals. This is a critical feature of the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\nWe can count the signals by analyzing the two main parts of the molecule based on the effective symmetry model.\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecule's effective plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from the cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Part 3: Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we arrive at the total number of observable signals:\n\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis result is robust and is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers, confirming its correctness.

The key is the use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base. It first deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which then attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base then deprotonates the same carbon again, allowing the resulting carbanion to perform an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1**: The final product, **4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product.

The structure of the product from each step is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction Type**: This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + ethanol, H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction Type**: This is a Fischer esterification.

This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry at room temperature, where the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion.\n\n**Key Concepts for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging**: Due to rapid ring flipping, the NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure. This creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence & Stereotopicity**: Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like the effective plane) or by rapid rotation are chemically equivalent. Protons on the same CH₂ group can be chemically distinct if they are diastereotopic.

In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent. C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon of the ring (e.g., C2), the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic). Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial in any given conformation) are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. Therefore, they give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion: Total Number of Signals**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThis result is confirmed by a more rigorous analysis that considers the molecule's chirality, which also leads to 8 signals.

The key points are the acidity of the α-protons in ethyl cyanoacetate and the use of *excess* base (NaH) with a dihaloalkane (1,5-dibromopentane). The excess base ensures two sequential deprotonations, allowing for an initial alkylation followed by an intramolecular cyclization to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.

This makes C1 a stereocenter, and the molecule is therefore chiral.\n2.  **Conformational Dynamics**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, which simplifies the analysis.\n3.  **Symmetry and Stereotopicity**: Due to the rapid ring-flipping, the molecule can be analyzed as having an *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4. Protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry or by rapid rotation are chemically distinct (diastereotopic).\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals based on the time-averaged structure:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    3.  **Protons on C2 and C6**: The effective symmetry plane makes these two carbons equivalent. On each carbon, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    4.  **Protons on C3 and C5**: The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    5.  **Protons on C4**: This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Total Signals = (Signals from Ethyl Group) + (Signals from Cyclohexane Ring)\n*   Total Signals = 2 + 6 = **8**\n\nThe number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8. Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) 5\nB) 12\nC) 10\nD) 8\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and the chemical principles involved, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly trace the four-step reaction sequence. There is a unanimous consensus on the identity of the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: α-Bromination.** Acetic acid is brominated at the alpha-carbon to yield **Product 1: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Step 2: Fischer Esterification.** Bromoacetic acid is esterified with ethanol to form **Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution.** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) in an Sₙ2 reaction to give **Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Step 4: Tandem Alkylation and Cyclization.** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice by excess sodium hydride (NaH) and reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. This results in a double alkylation that closes to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **Product 4: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Dynamics.** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring is not static. It undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion, meaning the ¹H NMR spectrum shows a time-averaged signal for the ring protons.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Molecular Symmetry.** The substituents on carbon C1 (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole is chiral, meaning it lacks a true plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereotopicity.** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid process, they are called diastereotopic and give rise to separate NMR signals. This is a crucial concept for cyclohexane rings and for CH₂ groups adjacent to a chiral center.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nThere are two valid models to analyze the molecule, both of which reassuringly lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Model A: The \"Effective Symmetry Plane\" Approach (Standard Textbook Method)**\nThis common approach assumes that the rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged \"effective\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH₃** group are equivalent due to free rotation. (**1 signal**)\n    *   The two protons of the **-OCH₂-** group are rendered enantiotopic by the effective symmetry plane. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. (**1 signal**)\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2/C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on these carbons are diastereotopic. The two axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3/C5:** The same logic applies, giving **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and not interchangeable, giving **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count (Model A):** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Rigorous Chirality\" Approach**\nThis model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral from the start.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the **-CH₃** group are equivalent. (**1 signal**)\n    *   The **-OCH₂-** group is adjacent to the chiral center (C1), making its two protons diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (**2 signals**)\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Due to the lack of symmetry, all five CH₂ groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid ring-flipping averages the axial and equatorial protons for each of these carbons into a single signal *for that specific carbon*. This results in **5 distinct signals** from the five unique CH₂ groups.\n\n*   **Total Count (Model B):** 1 + 2 + 5 = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth chemically sound methods of analysis converge on the same result: the final product has **8** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms. The candidate answers unanimously agree on this number, although they show confusion in matching it to the provided options.\n\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) 8\nB) 5\nC) 10\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing that structure to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms for its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence must be analyzed step-by-step to identify the final product.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1**: The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2**: The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3**: The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4**: This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction. The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of these protons. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The problem specifies *excess* NaH, which is a critical detail; it ensures the second, remaining proton on the α-carbon is also removed. This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4 is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1. Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same CH₂ group are not necessarily equivalent. If they are in different chemical environments (e.g., axial vs. equatorial in a ring, or adjacent to a chiral center), they are diastereotopic and give distinct signals.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\nWe will analyze the structure based on the effective plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group: 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1.

The excess base ensures both acidic α-protons are used for two successive alkylations, the second of which is an intramolecular ring closure.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key principles.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring is not static; it undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure resulting from this rapid flipping.\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid flipping creates an *effective plane of symmetry* in the time-averaged molecule. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group. Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon atom (geminal protons) are not always equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by symmetry or rotation, they are diastereotopic and give rise to separate NMR signals. This is particularly important for the protons on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nBased on the principles above, we can systematically count the signals.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Subtotal for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Subtotal for cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of distinct hydrogen signals is the sum of the signals from each part of the molecule:\n\nTotal Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from cyclohexane ring) = **8**\n\nThis result is robust, as more rigorous analyses that account for the molecule's inherent chirality also converge on the same answer of 8 signals. All the provided candidate answers correctly performed this analysis and arrived at the number 8.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 12\nC) 8\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the information from all candidate answers to establish a consensus on the chemical reasoning.

The structure of the final product is determined by following this sequence:\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and a sulfuric acid catalyst is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted into its corresponding ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The protons on the CH₂ group of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The use of *excess* NaH is crucial. It ensures the second, remaining proton on the α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   The resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4):** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Careful Points for NMR Analysis:**\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure.\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. In a cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on a given CH₂ group are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the effective plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the symmetry plane. However, its two protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis result is confirmed by a more rigorous analysis that considers the molecule's inherent chirality, which also leads to 8 signals. The calculated number of signals is 8.

All candidate answers correctly identified the product of each step, and their consensus is accurate.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification, converting the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem alkylation and cyclization reaction. The strong base (NaH) first deprotonates the acidic α-carbon. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base removes the second α-proton, and the new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack to close a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product (4):** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton. All candidate answers correctly concluded there are 8 signals, and their reasoning is sound.\n\n**Key Concepts for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The observed NMR spectrum is a time-average of these conformations.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons that are not interchangeable by symmetry or rapid processes are chemically distinct. Protons on the same CH₂ group are often distinct (diastereotopic) in cyclic systems or chiral molecules.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective plane of symmetry makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and positions C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the effective symmetry plane. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis conclusion is robust, as alternative rigorous models that account for the molecule's chirality also converge on the answer of 8 signals.

The use of **excess** NaH is critical; it ensures that both acidic protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two separate alkylation steps. The first deprotonation is followed by an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.

This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, incorporating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly trace the four-step synthesis. The process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**: The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an **α-bromination**, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1**: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**: The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and sulfuric acid is a **Fischer esterification**, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2**: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**: The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a **nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2)**, where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3**: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**: The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a **tandem alkylation-cyclization**. The excess NaH ensures both acidic protons on the central carbon are used in two successive alkylations, leading to the formation of a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key principles.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry and Stereotopicity**: The final product has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on carbon C1. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole is chiral. This lack of true symmetry means that protons on the same CH₂ group (geminal protons) are often diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n*   **Analytical Models**: As shown in the candidate answers, there are two valid models for analyzing this molecule, both of which reassuringly lead to the same conclusion.\n\n    *   **Model A (The \"Effective Symmetry Plane\" Approach):** This common textbook method assumes that rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n        *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent (1 signal). The two -OCH₂- protons are enantiotopic due to the effective plane and are equivalent in an achiral solvent (1 signal). Total = **2 signals**.\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring:** The plane makes C2/C6 and C3/C5 equivalent pairs. On each pair, the axial-like and equatorial-like protons are distinct. The protons on C4 are also distinct from each other. This gives 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **6 signals**.\n        *   **Total (Model A): 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\n    *   **Model B (The \"Rigorous Chirality\" Approach):** This model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral from the start.\n        *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The three -CH₃ protons are equivalent (1 signal).

All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at this number.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 12\nD) 5\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe first step is to correctly identify the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence. All candidate answers have correctly deduced this sequence.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst (pyridine/acetic anhydride) is an α-bromination, a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction. This yields **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. This yields **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide. This yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The acidic protons on the carbon between the -CN and -COOEt groups are removed sequentially by excess sodium hydride (NaH). The resulting carbanions react first with one end of 1,5-dibromopentane and then intramolecularly with the other end to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of molecular symmetry and dynamics.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to this rapid flipping, the molecule possesses an *effective* plane of symmetry for NMR purposes. This plane passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid rotation, they are diastereotopic and give distinct NMR signals. This is a critical feature of the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\nWe can count the signals by analyzing the two main parts of the molecule based on the effective symmetry model.\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are rendered enantiotopic by the molecule's effective plane of symmetry. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry plane makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from the cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Part 3: Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we arrive at the total number of observable signals:\n\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis result is robust and is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers, confirming its correctness. Comparing this number to the provided options:\n\nA) 10\nB) 5\nC) 12\nD) 8\n\nThe calculated number of 8 distinct hydrogen signals corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the careful points to consider.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure**\n\nAll candidate answers unanimously and correctly identified the structure of the final product by analyzing the four-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid)**\n    *   The reaction of acetic acid with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction), which brominates the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate)**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to its ethyl ester using ethanol and an acid catalyst.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n    *   This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The key is the use of *excess* sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base. It first deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which then attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base then deprotonates the same carbon again, allowing the resulting carbanion to perform an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, closing a six-membered ring.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1**: The final product, **4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product.

The symmetry makes the axial proton on C2 equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for these four protons (one signal for the axial pair, one for the equatorial pair).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1.

The excess base ensures two sequential deprotonations, allowing for an initial alkylation followed by an intramolecular cyclization to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4**: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of molecular symmetry and stereochemistry.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Structure and Chirality**: The final product has two different substituents (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) on carbon C1 of the cyclohexane ring. This makes C1 a stereocenter, and the molecule is therefore chiral.\n2.  **Conformational Dynamics**: At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, which simplifies the analysis.\n3.  **Symmetry and Stereotopicity**: Due to the rapid ring-flipping, the molecule can be analyzed as having an *effective* plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4. Protons that are not interchangeable by this symmetry or by rapid rotation are chemically distinct (diastereotopic).\n\n**Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\nWe can systematically count the signals based on the time-averaged structure:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.

Matching this result with the provided options:\nA) 5\nB) 12\nC) 10\nD) 8\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and the chemical principles involved, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly trace the four-step reaction sequence. There is a unanimous consensus on the identity of the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: α-Bromination.** Acetic acid is brominated at the alpha-carbon to yield **Product 1: Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Step 2: Fischer Esterification.** Bromoacetic acid is esterified with ethanol to form **Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Step 3: Nucleophilic Substitution.** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) in an Sₙ2 reaction to give **Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Step 4: Tandem Alkylation and Cyclization.** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated twice by excess sodium hydride (NaH) and reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. This results in a double alkylation that closes to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **Product 4: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Conformational Dynamics.** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring is not static. It undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion, meaning the ¹H NMR spectrum shows a time-averaged signal for the ring protons.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Molecular Symmetry.** The substituents on carbon C1 (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole is chiral, meaning it lacks a true plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereotopicity.** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. If they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid process, they are called diastereotopic and give rise to separate NMR signals. This is a crucial concept for cyclohexane rings and for CH₂ groups adjacent to a chiral center.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nThere are two valid models to analyze the molecule, both of which reassuringly lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Model A: The \"Effective Symmetry Plane\" Approach (Standard Textbook Method)**\nThis common approach assumes that the rapid ring-flipping creates a time-averaged \"effective\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH₃** group are equivalent due to free rotation.

The two axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3/C5:** The same logic applies, giving **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and not interchangeable, giving **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count (Model A):** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\n**Model B: The \"Rigorous Chirality\" Approach**\nThis model correctly identifies the molecule as chiral from the start.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the **-CH₃** group are equivalent. (**1 signal**)\n    *   The **-OCH₂-** group is adjacent to the chiral center (C1), making its two protons diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (**2 signals**)\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Due to the lack of symmetry, all five CH₂ groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Rapid ring-flipping averages the axial and equatorial protons for each of these carbons into a single signal *for that specific carbon*. This results in **5 distinct signals** from the five unique CH₂ groups.\n\n*   **Total Count (Model B):** 1 + 2 + 5 = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth chemically sound methods of analysis converge on the same result: the final product has **8** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms. The candidate answers unanimously agree on this number, although they show confusion in matching it to the provided options.\n\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) 8\nB) 5\nC) 10\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing that structure to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms for its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence must be analyzed step-by-step to identify the final product.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1**: The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This reaction replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2**: The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3**: The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3 is Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4**: This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction. The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) groups are acidic. The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of these protons. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane. The problem specifies *excess* NaH, which is a critical detail; it ensures the second, remaining proton on the α-carbon is also removed. This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4 is Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure.\n*   **Symmetry:** This rapid flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1. Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same CH₂ group are not necessarily equivalent. If they are in different chemical environments (e.g., axial vs. equatorial in a ring, or adjacent to a chiral center), they are diastereotopic and give distinct signals.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\nWe will analyze the structure based on the effective plane of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group: 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent. Likewise, C3 and C5 are equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** On any single carbon (like C2), the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals** (one for the two axial-like protons, one for the two equatorial-like protons).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from the cyclohexane ring: 6 signals.*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule, we get:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is 8. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly trace the four-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This yields **bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)**.\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification, converting the carboxylic acid to an ethyl ester. This yields **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion. This yields **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** The reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane is a tandem alkylation-cyclization. The excess base ensures both acidic α-protons are removed sequentially, allowing for two alkylations. The final intramolecular alkylation closes a six-membered ring. This yields **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product**\n\nThe central task is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. This requires careful consideration of several key points.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The ¹H NMR spectrum reflects a time-averaged structure, not a single static conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** The rapid ring-flipping creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the substituted carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the two substituents on C1. Protons that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Stereotopicity:** Protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) are not necessarily equivalent. In the cyclohexane ring, the axial-like and equatorial-like protons on any given CH₂ group are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic) and thus give distinct signals.\n\n### **Part 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals**\n\nWe can count the signals by analyzing each part of the molecule based on the time-averaged structure.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-OCH₂-**) are related by the effective plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The effective symmetry plane makes the ring positions C2 and C6 equivalent, and C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The four protons on these two carbons are divided into two sets. The two axial-like protons are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these two carbons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. They are not interchangeable and are therefore chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from the cyclohexane ring = 6 signals.*\n\n### **Part 4: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 8**\n\nThis result is robust, as alternative and more rigorous analyses that explicitly consider the molecule's chirality also converge on the same answer of 8 signals.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 5\nB) 12\nC) 8\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
