The agents unanimously agree on the chemical structure but differ on the final letter choice due to variations in the option lists they were given. The following analysis will determine the structure and match it to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out structures that are not primary amines. A secondary amine or amide (like option A) would show only one N-H band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option C, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option D, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** represent a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most diagnostic signal in the spectrum. This highly downfield shift confirms the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to the highly electronegative oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (D), where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This rules out the meta-substituted option C.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Decision\n\nAssembling all the pieces of evidence:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis combination leads to only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (isomer; NMR quartet would be ~2.5 ppm).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation suggests an additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O), especially given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as option **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the functional group type. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option C), which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹, and too low for a phenyl ester (like option A), which is typically above 1750 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. This significant downfield shift means the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly contradicts option **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out option **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted. The chemical shifts also confirm the arrangement: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons (upfield at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons (downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect.\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct.**\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the candidate answers to establish a consensus on the chemical structure and understand the reason for their conflicting final letter choices. Then, I will conduct my own detailed, step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data (Degree of Unsaturation, IR, and 1H NMR), highlighting the most critical data points that confirm the structure and rule out the alternatives.

Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. For example, a secondary amine or amide (like option B) would show only one N-H band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing between carbonyl types. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option D) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option A, Ar-O-COR, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most critical piece of data for determining the connectivity. This very downfield position indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of evidence rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (A), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out the meta-substituted option D. The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nAssembling all the evidence:\n1.

This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond.

The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. This eliminates option C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (a secondary amide), and makes option D, 3-ethoxybenzamide (a primary amide), less likely due to the C=O frequency.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the functional group type. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This provides strong evidence for an ester and against an amide or a phenyl ester isomer.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most critical piece of data for determining the molecule's connectivity. A methylene group (-CH₂-) this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom. This specific shift is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃). This single piece of data definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (-CO-CH₂CH₃), and the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out the meta-substituted option **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer ruled out by the NMR chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect.

The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. Option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing between carbonyl types. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹), making option A (3-ethoxybenzamide) unlikely. It is also too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR), which would appear at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹), making option D (4-aminophenyl propionate) unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most diagnostic signal in the spectrum. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group (-CH₂-) is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly confirms the structure is an ethyl ester (Ar-COOCH₂CH₃) and rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (Option D), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out the meta-substituted option A (3-ethoxybenzamide). The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Structure and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Structure Assembly:** The combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement.

There is a unanimous consensus among all candidates that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent, not due to any error in the chemical reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which equals `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly part of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. Option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band, so it is incorrect.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl functional group. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option A, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like in option C, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester like that in option D the most likely candidate.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly rules out the isomer, option C (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl and appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is meta-substituted. The chemical shifts also confirm the arrangement: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation points to one additional pi bond, which, given the two oxygen atoms, is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation is highly diagnostic. It immediately rules out any structure that is not a primary amine. For example, it excludes **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is key to identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic triplet-quartet pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most crucial piece of evidence in the spectrum. A methylene group (-CH₂-) is shifted this far downfield only when it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the structure is an **ethyl ester**. This single data point definitively rules out the isomer **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This substitution pattern rules out **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted and would give a more complex splitting pattern. The chemical shifts also confirm the substituent identities: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (Isomer with wrong NMR shift).\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (Secondary amide, not primary amine/ester).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (Meta-substituted amide).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - **Correct**.

A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option C, which would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option D, Ar-O-COR, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. A methylene group (-CH₂-) is shifted this far downfield only when it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment and definitively rules out the isomer, option D (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out the meta-substituted option C. The difference in their chemical shifts confirms that one substituent is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group, shifting its ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, shifting its ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAll pieces of evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect (isomer with incorrect NMR shift for the ethyl group).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A Degree of Unsaturation of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* bands is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This observation immediately rules out any structure that is not a primary amine, such as **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption indicating a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is key to identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which would be <1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data rules out the isomer **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is a typical feature of exchangeable protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out any meta-substituted structures like **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts confirms that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (isomer with a different ester linkage, inconsistent with NMR).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a consensus of the candidate answers and a detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. Option C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band, so it is incorrect.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl group. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option D, which would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option A, Ar-O-COR, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester structure the most likely candidate.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) represents the 3 protons of the methyl group, and the quartet (q) represents the 2 protons of the methylene group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most critical piece of data for determining the structure. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly rules out the isomer **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This para-substitution pattern rules out the meta-substituted **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Structure and Final Decision**\n1.  **Structure Assembly:** The combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n2.  **Option Evaluation:** Matching this identified structure to the provided options:\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect.

The agents unanimously agree on the chemical structure but differ on the final letter choice due to variations in the option lists they were given. The following analysis will determine the structure and match it to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond.

IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out structures that are not primary amines. A secondary amine or amide (like option A) would show only one N-H band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option C, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option D, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** represent a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most diagnostic signal in the spectrum. This highly downfield shift confirms the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to the highly electronegative oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (D), where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm. This rules out the meta-substituted option C.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Decision\n\nAssembling all the pieces of evidence:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis combination leads to only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (isomer; NMR quartet would be ~2.5 ppm).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation suggests an additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O), especially given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region.

A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option C), which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹, and too low for a phenyl ester (like option A), which is typically above 1750 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. This significant downfield shift means the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.

The chemical shifts also confirm the arrangement: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons (upfield at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons (downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.

The chemical reasoning itself is sound across all answers.\n----------------------------------------\n### Step 2: Independent Verification of Spectral Data ###\n\n--- Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2) and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) ---\nDoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 5.\nCareful Point: A DoU of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond, likely a C=O group (1 degree).\n\n--- IR Spectrum ---\nBands at 3420 & 3325 cm-1: This pair of peaks is a definitive signature of a primary amine (-NH2).\nCareful Point: This rules out secondary amides like option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide), which would have only one N-H band.\nBand at 1720 cm-1: This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) in a conjugated ester.\nCareful Point: This frequency is too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm-1, ruling out A) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm-1, ruling out D).\n\n--- 1H NMR Spectrum ---\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H) & 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): This is a classic ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\nCareful Point: The quartet's chemical shift at 4.5 ppm is the most critical piece of data. This highly deshielded position confirms the -CH2- is attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3). This definitively rules out the isomer D (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the -CH2- next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for 2 protons confirms the primary amine (-NH2).\n7.0 ppm (d, 2H) & 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This pattern of two doublets indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\nCareful Point: This para-substitution pattern rules out meta-substituted compounds like option A (3-ethoxybenzamide). The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group, and the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n----------------------------------------\n### Step 3: Assembling the Final Structure ###\nThe combined evidence from all data points unequivocally points to the structure being a para-substituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group.\nThe correct chemical name is: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n----------------------------------------\n### Step 4: Matching Structure to the Original Options ###\nThe options provided in the user's question are:\n  Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide\n  -> This is incorrect based on the spectral analysis.\n  Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n  -> This is incorrect based on the spectral analysis.\n  Option C: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n  -> This matches our identified structure.\n  Option D: 4-aminophenyl propionate\n  -> This is incorrect based on the spectral analysis.\n\n### Final Decision ###\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which corresponds to option C in the provided list.\nThe final answer is C\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. For example, a secondary amine or amide (like option B) would show only one N-H band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing between carbonyl types. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option D) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option A, Ar-O-COR, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most critical piece of data for determining the connectivity. This very downfield position indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of evidence rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (A), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out the meta-substituted option D. The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nAssembling all the evidence:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these pieces of evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this identified structure to the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shift for the ethyl group's CH₂ would be wrong.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this extra pi bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines.

A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl (-CH₃) group, and the quartet (q) is the methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out any meta-substituted structures like **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the identity of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Structure and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Structure Assembly:** The combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n2.  **Option Evaluation:** Now, we match this identified structure to the options provided in the question.\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. (meta-substituted amide)\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. (Isomer with wrong NMR shift for the ethyl group)\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. (Secondary amide)\n    *   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring, which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation suggests an additional pi bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O), especially given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. This eliminates option C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (a secondary amide), and makes option D, 3-ethoxybenzamide (a primary amide), less likely due to the C=O frequency.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the functional group type. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This provides strong evidence for an ester and against an amide or a phenyl ester isomer.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most critical piece of data for determining the molecule's connectivity. A methylene group (-CH₂-) this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom. This specific shift is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃). This single piece of data definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (-CO-CH₂CH₃), and the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out the meta-substituted option **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.

This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect.

This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data for an ester and the NMR data for para-substitution.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.

A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹), making option A (3-ethoxybenzamide) unlikely. It is also too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR), which would appear at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹), making option D (4-aminophenyl propionate) unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most diagnostic signal in the spectrum. This very downfield position indicates the methylene group (-CH₂-) is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.

There is a unanimous consensus among all candidates that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent, not due to any error in the chemical reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which equals `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly part of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. Option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band, so it is incorrect.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl functional group. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option A, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like in option C, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester like that in option D the most likely candidate.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This directly rules out the isomer, option C (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl and appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is meta-substituted. The chemical shifts also confirm the arrangement: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds).

The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation is highly diagnostic. It immediately rules out any structure that is not a primary amine. For example, it excludes **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is key to identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic triplet-quartet pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most crucial piece of evidence in the spectrum. A methylene group (-CH₂-) is shifted this far downfield only when it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the structure is an **ethyl ester**. This single data point definitively rules out the isomer **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This substitution pattern rules out **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted and would give a more complex splitting pattern. The chemical shifts also confirm the substituent identities: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (Isomer with wrong NMR shift).\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (Secondary amide, not primary amine/ester).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (Meta-substituted amide).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - **Correct**. This name and structure perfectly match all spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the provided answers and a comprehensive analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown to identify the correct compound.\n\n### **Analysis of Candidate Answers**\nAll candidate answers perform a correct and consistent chemical analysis. There is a unanimous consensus that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) across the different answers is due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order to each agent, not due to any error in the chemical reasoning itself.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structure that is not a primary amine. It specifically eliminates **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. This highly downfield shift confirms the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to the highly electronegative oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data definitively rules out the isomer **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern. The chemical shifts also confirm the substituent identities: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons (upfield at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons (downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAll pieces of evidence from the molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR spectra converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is a definitive signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures containing secondary amines (-NH-) or amides that do not have an -NH₂ group. This eliminates option **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing between carbonyl types. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester structure highly likely and an amide (like option A) or a phenyl ester (like option B) less likely.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is highly significant. Such a downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were part of a propionate chain (as in option B, -CO-CH₂CH₃), the quartet would appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm). This definitively rules out **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out any meta-substituted isomers like **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the electronic nature of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this identified structure to the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect (isomer with wrong NMR shift).\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect (secondary amide).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough, independent analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct compound can be determined.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nAll 15 candidate answers perform a correct and consistent chemical analysis. There is a unanimous consensus that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order to each agent. The underlying chemical reasoning is sound and identical across all answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond.

The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm). This confirms the para arrangement and rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe combined evidence from the molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR spectra unequivocally points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds.

The remaining degree of unsaturation points to one additional pi bond, which, given the two oxygen atoms, is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This observation is crucial as it immediately rules out structures that are not primary amines. For example, option A, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H band.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption indicating a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of the C=O stretch is highly diagnostic. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option C, which would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option D, Ar-O-COR, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. A methylene group (-CH₂-) is shifted this far downfield only when it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment and definitively rules out the isomer, option D (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out the meta-substituted option C. The difference in their chemical shifts confirms that one substituent is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group, shifting its ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, shifting its ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAll pieces of evidence converge on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.

A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option D, which would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option A, Ar-O-COR, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹).
