The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the agents are due to inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options they were presented with. The following analysis synthesizes their collective reasoning to arrive at the definitive answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When taking the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and having the same albedo ($A$ is constant), these terms cancel out, leaving a simplified relationship dependent only on the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**, which justifies assuming the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Rearranging the simplified formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. We can now find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Calculate:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation. The square root cancels the squared terms:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific spectral line wavelength. This information is not needed to calculate the final ratio and is included to test conceptual understanding of which physical quantities are relevant.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is crucial. The transit detection justifies the key assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), which simplifies the RV formula and makes the problem solvable.\n*   **Index Consistency:** It is critical to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the derivation. The final formula correctly combines the inverse mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) with the direct Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** The calculation consistently yields a result of ~0.536. This numerical result must be correctly matched to the corresponding lettered option from the original question's list.\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical derivation and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options in the candidate responses. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Goal**: The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\n    For two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and having the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies significantly as these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplify and Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The RV formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n    Rearranging this to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Equation**: Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    The square root cancels the squares, yielding the final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass (1.5 M_Sun), radius (1.2 R_Sun), and temperature (6300 K), as well as the planets' radii (1.7 and 1.3 R_Earth). This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out. They are included to test a conceptual understanding of the relevant physics.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method**: The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is critical. The transit detection justifies the key assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this, the problem would be unsolvable with the given information.\n*   **Index Consistency**: It is crucial to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the derivation. The final formula correctly shows that the temperature ratio is proportional to the *inverse* of the mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) but the *direct* ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Doppler Shift Interpretation**: The problem states a \"periodic shift of up to...\" a certain value. This phrase refers to the maximum Doppler shift, which is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), allowing their ratios to be used interchangeably.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and unanimously yields a value of approximately 0.5357. Comparing this result to the options provided in the original question:\n\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value of 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the correct physical derivation that is consistently used across all the provided candidate answers. I will then identify the key assumptions and potential pitfalls, such as irrelevant information or misinterpretation of the problem statement. Finally, I will use a Python script to perform the definitive calculation based on the consensus-derived formula and determine the correct option from the choices provided in the original question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Goal Definition**: The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and sharing the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the formula simplifies significantly. This is a point of universal agreement among all candidate answers.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Final Formula Derivation**: We substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation. The square root cancels the squares:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, their ratios are equal: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: As all candidate answers correctly point out, the mention of the **transit method** is crucial. It justifies the assumption that both orbits are edge-on ($i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90^\\circ$), which means $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$. The inclination term cancels out, leaving the final formula for calculation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not required to solve for the temperature ratio. They are included as contextual details that cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Significance of Transit Method**: The problem states that the planets were detected using both transit and RV methods. The mention of the transit method is essential because it justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical relationship and perform the calculation to arrive at the numerical result of ~0.5357.

The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left(1/a_1\\right)^{1/2}}{\\left(1/a_2\\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $$ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We rearrange the simplified formula to solve for $a$:\n    $$ K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2} $$\n    Now, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants $G$ and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas to Find the Final Equation:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root cancels the squares, leading to the final, simple formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Use Doppler Shift Data for the Final Calculation:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.

For two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and having the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the ratio of their temperatures simplifies to a function of their semi-major axes ($a$) only:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. A critical piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**, which justifies assuming the orbital inclination is nearly edge-on ($i \\approx 90^\\circ$), so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Rearranging the simplified RV formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Expression:** Substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes back into the temperature ratio equation.

Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). This gives the final formula for calculation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** Plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed to calculate the final ratio, such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature, and the planets' radii. These values cancel out when forming the ratio, and their inclusion tests the ability to identify the relevant physical quantities.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using the transit method is crucial. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.

The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\n    For two planets orbiting the same star, the stellar parameters ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A$). When we form the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, these constant terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplify Using Problem Constraints:** A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Therefore, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, and the term can be removed. The simplified formula is:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n5.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Rearranging the simplified formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$.

Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass (1.5 M_Sun), radius (1.2 R_Sun), and temperature (6300 K), as well as the planets' radii.

The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    We rearrange this formula to solve for $a$:\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants $G$ (gravitational constant) and $M_*$ (star's mass) will cancel out.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Simplify:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) $$\n    Using the careful points below, this simplifies further. The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so their ratios are equal ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). The inclination terms also cancel, leading to the final formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    A) ~ 0.53\n    B) ~ 1.05\n    C) ~ 1.30\n    D) ~ 0.98\n    The calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out in the derivation. They are included to test a complete understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **Significance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is crucial. The transit method only works if the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on (inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$). This justifies the key assumption that $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, which causes the inclination term to cancel out and makes the problem solvable.\n*   **Index Consistency:** Throughout the derivation, it is critical to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent to avoid inverting a ratio by mistake. The final formula correctly combines the inverse mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) with the direct Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$) relative to the temperature ratio ($T_{eq,1}/T_{eq,2}$).\n*   **Doppler Shift vs. RV Amplitude:** It is essential to recognize that the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). This allows the direct use of the ratio of the given Doppler shifts in place of the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes.\n*   **Clerical Errors in Final Selection:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the physics and calculation were performed correctly by all, several made a simple clerical error by matching the correct numerical result (~0.536) to the wrong letter option due to shuffled option lists. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final selection against the original list of options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, there is a clear consensus on the physical principles and the numerical result.

The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A$). When forming the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, these constant terms cancel out, leaving a much simpler relationship:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**: The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star.

The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out. As explained in the \"Careful Points\" below, the $\\sin(i)$ term also cancels.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Final Formula Derivation**: Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: We plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii.

The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: Rearranging the simplified formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Substitute Doppler Shift Data**: Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation.

For two planets orbiting the same star, the star's effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and radius ($R_*$) are constant. The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A$). When we form the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, these constant terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options in the candidate responses. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Goal**: The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\n    For two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and having the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies significantly as these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplify and Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**.

Finally, I will use a Python script to perform the definitive calculation based on the consensus-derived formula and determine the correct option from the choices provided in the original question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Goal Definition**: The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and sharing the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the formula simplifies significantly. This is a point of universal agreement among all candidate answers.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Final Formula Derivation**: We substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation. The square root cancels the squares:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, their ratios are equal: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: As all candidate answers correctly point out, the mention of the **transit method** is crucial. It justifies the assumption that both orbits are edge-on ($i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90^\\circ$), which means $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$. The inclination term cancels out, leaving the final formula for calculation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not required to solve for the temperature ratio. They are included as contextual details that cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Significance of Transit Method**: The problem states that the planets were detected using both transit and RV methods. The mention of the transit method is essential because it justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical relationship and perform the calculation to arrive at the numerical result of ~0.5357.

The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left(1/a_1\\right)^{1/2}}{\\left(1/a_2\\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $$ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**.

For two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and having the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the ratio of their temperatures simplifies to a function of their semi-major axes ($a$) only:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star.

Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). This gives the final formula for calculation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** Plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed to calculate the final ratio, such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature, and the planets' radii. These values cancel out when forming the ratio, and their inclusion tests the ability to identify the relevant physical quantities.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using the transit method is crucial.

When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the star's properties ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states the planets have the same albedo ($A$).

This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The RV formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n    Rearranging this formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The physical constants ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Equation:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root cancels the squared terms, yielding the final, simplified formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass (1.5 M_Sun), radius (1.2 R_Sun), and effective temperature (6300 K), as well as the planets' radii (1.7 and 1.3 R_Earth). This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out in the derivation. They are included to test a conceptual understanding of the relevant physics.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is critical. The transit detection justifies the key assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this, the problem would be unsolvable with the given information.\n*   **Index Consistency:** It is crucial to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the derivation. An error, such as inverting one of the ratios (e.g., using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$ instead of $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$), would lead to an incorrect result. The final formula correctly combines the inverse mass ratio with the direct Doppler shift ratio.\n*   **Doppler Shift and RV Amplitude:** It is essential to recognize that the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). This allows the direct use of the ratio of the given Doppler shifts in place of the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and unanimously yields a value of approximately **0.5357**.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) stem from inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options presented to each agent, not from any error in the scientific reasoning.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal Definition**: The objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When calculating the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the star's properties ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Simplification and Derivation of the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the planets' orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the orbital inclination $i$ is approximately 90° for both. This justifies the assumption that $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The RV formula simplifies to $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Final Formula Derivation**: We substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation. The square root cancels the squared terms:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Using Doppler Shift Data**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, their ratios are equal: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: We plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass Ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler Shift Ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii.

An error, such as inverting one of the ratios (e.g., using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$ instead of $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$), would lead to an incorrect result.
