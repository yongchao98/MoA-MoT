This complex will dissociate slightly to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$), which corresponds to the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we can either use the $K_f$ expression directly or calculate the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of $K_f$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track concentrations.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem starts with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions. The relevant reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nWe are given the *formation* constant (K_f) for the reaction Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻, which is K_f = 5x10¹⁰.\nSince we are analyzing the *dissociation* of the complex, we can either work with the K_f expression or calculate the dissociation constant (K_d).\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nUsing the K_f expression is more direct and avoids an intermediate calculation. The expression is:\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table**\nWe can track the concentrations as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [CaY]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n**4. Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant (K_f) expression:\n5x10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nA very large K_f value (5x10¹⁰) indicates that the complex is extremely stable and will barely dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the valid approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentration of Calcium Ions (x)**\nRearrange the equation to solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7. Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The calculation must be based on the dissociation of the complex since the initial solution contains the complex, not the free ions.\n*   The approximation (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is valid and necessary for a straightforward calculation. The result (x ≈ 6.3x10⁻⁷) confirms the validity, as it is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02.\n*   The \"ideal pH\" condition is a critical piece of information that allows the direct use of the given formation constant without needing to adjust for the protonation of free EDTA.\n*   Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to match the numerical result to the correct letter option from the original prompt. The calculation consistently and correctly yields ~6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this chemical equilibrium problem by following these steps:\n1.  **Identify the core chemical reaction:** The problem starts with a Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). The reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻.\n2.  **Set up the equilibrium expression:** We are given the formation constant (K_f), which is for the reverse reaction. The expression is K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]).\n3.  **Define equilibrium concentrations:** Using an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table approach, let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium. Then, [Y⁴⁻] will also be 'x', and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus 'x'.\n4.  **Apply a simplifying approximation:** Since the formation constant K_f (5x10¹⁰) is extremely large, the complex is very stable, and the amount that dissociates ('x') will be negligible compared to the initial concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the complex as its initial concentration, 0.02 M.\n5.  **Solve for 'x':** With the approximation, the equilibrium expression simplifies to K_f ≈ 0.02 / x².

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as $[CaY]^{2-}$, where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, the relevant reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nThe problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which corresponds to the formation reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n$K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nFor the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**3.

Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nWe can use either the $K_f$ or $K_d$ expression. Using the $K_d$ expression is slightly more direct:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nA crucial point is that the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, which means the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the valid approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\nThe simplified equation becomes:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n**6.

Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nThe formation constant (K_f) is extremely large, which means the dissociation constant (K_d) is extremely small. This indicates that the complex is very stable and only a tiny fraction will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the valid approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**6.

To find the concentration of free calcium ions, `Ca²⁺`, we must consider the dissociation of this complex. The relevant equilibrium reaction is:\n    `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:** The problem provides the formation constant, `K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰`. This constant applies to the formation reaction, which is the reverse of the dissociation:\n    `Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻`\n    The expression for `K_f` is:\n    `K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])`\n    We can use this expression directly, or we can calculate the dissociation constant, `K_d`, which is the inverse of `K_f`:\n    `K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹`\n\n3.  **Set up an Equilibrium Table (ICE Table):** We can track the concentrations as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of `Ca²⁺`.\n    *   **Initial:** `[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]` = 0.02 M; `[Ca²⁺]` = 0; `[EDTA⁴⁻]` = 0\n    *   **Change:** `[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]` decreases by x; `[Ca²⁺]` increases by x; `[EDTA⁴⁻]` increases by x.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** `[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]` = 0.02 - x; `[Ca²⁺]` = x; `[EDTA⁴⁻]` = x\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:** Using the formation constant `K_f`:\n    `K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)`\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²`\n\n5.  **Apply a Valid Approximation:** The formation constant `K_f` is extremely large. This indicates that the complex is very stable and the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be negligibly small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** The equation simplifies to:\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²`\n    Rearranging to solve for `x²`:\n    `x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹² = 4 x 10⁻¹³`\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    `x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, `[Ca²⁺]`, is equal to x.\n    `[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    The calculated value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct Equilibrium:** The calculation must be based on the dissociation of the complex, as that is the source of the free `Ca²⁺` ions.\n*   **Correct Use of K:** One must either use the `K_f` expression correctly or calculate and use the `K_d` for the dissociation. Both methods lead to the same result.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` is valid because `6.3 x 10⁻⁷` is many orders of magnitude smaller than `0.02`.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\":** This phrase is crucial as it allows the direct use of the given `K_f` without needing to account for the protonation of EDTA, which would introduce a pH-dependent conditional formation constant.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** A common error in the candidate answers was correctly calculating the numerical value but then assigning it to the wrong letter option. The value `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M` correctly corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as $[CaY]^{2-}$. This complex is very stable, but it will dissociate to a small extent to establish an equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and the EDTA anion ($Y^{4-}$).

    "My plan is to solve this chemical equilibrium problem by following a systematic approach, which is consistently demonstrated across the provided candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Reaction:** The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. To find the concentration of free calcium ions, we must analyze the dissociation of this complex:\n    `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`\n\n2.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** We are given the formation constant (`K_f`), which is for the reverse reaction. The expression for `K_f` is:\n    `K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])`\n\n3.  **Define Equilibrium Concentrations:** I will use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table logic. Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of `Ca²⁺`. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of `EDTA⁴⁻` will also be 'x'. The concentration of the complex will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus the amount that dissociated ('x').\n\n4.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The formation constant (`K_f = 5x10¹⁰`) is extremely large. This means the complex is very stable and only a tiny amount, 'x', will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' is negligible compared to the initial concentration, allowing the approximation `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ≈ 0.02 M`.\n\n5.  **Solve for 'x':** With the approximation, the equilibrium expression simplifies to `K_f ≈ 0.02 / x²`. I will write a Python script to rearrange this equation and solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I will compare the calculated value of 'x' to the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct Equilibrium:** The calculation must be based on the dissociation of the complex, as the initial solution contains the complex, not the free ions.\n*   **Correct Use of K_f:** The formation constant is used, but it's applied to the equilibrium state resulting from dissociation. The expression `K_f = (initial_complex - x) / x²` is the correct setup.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` is justified because `K_f` is very large, indicating `x` will be very small.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem starts with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions. The relevant reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nWe are given the *formation* constant (K_f) for the reaction Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻, which is K_f = 5x10¹⁰.\nSince we are analyzing the *dissociation* of the complex, we can either work with the K_f expression or calculate the dissociation constant (K_d).\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nUsing the K_f expression is more direct and avoids an intermediate calculation. The expression is:\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table**\nWe can track the concentrations as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [CaY]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n**4. Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant (K_f) expression:\n5x10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nA very large K_f value (5x10¹⁰) indicates that the complex is extremely stable and will barely dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the valid approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentration of Calcium Ions (x)**\nRearrange the equation to solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7. Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.

The result (x ≈ 6.3x10⁻⁷) confirms the validity, as it is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02.\n*   The \"ideal pH\" condition is a critical piece of information that allows the direct use of the given formation constant without needing to adjust for the protonation of free EDTA.\n*   Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to match the numerical result to the correct letter option from the original prompt. The calculation consistently and correctly yields ~6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this chemical equilibrium problem by following these steps:\n1.  **Identify the core chemical reaction:** The problem starts with a Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). The reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻.\n2.  **Set up the equilibrium expression:** We are given the formation constant (K_f), which is for the reverse reaction. The expression is K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]).\n3.  **Define equilibrium concentrations:** Using an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table approach, let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium. Then, [Y⁴⁻] will also be 'x', and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus 'x'.\n4.  **Apply a simplifying approximation:** Since the formation constant K_f (5x10¹⁰) is extremely large, the complex is very stable, and the amount that dissociates ('x') will be negligible compared to the initial concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the complex as its initial concentration, 0.02 M.\n5.  **Solve for 'x':** With the approximation, the equilibrium expression simplifies to K_f ≈ 0.02 / x².

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as $[CaY]^{2-}$, where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, the relevant reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nThe problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which corresponds to the formation reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n$K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nFor the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**3.

Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nWe can use either the $K_f$ or $K_d$ expression.

Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nA crucial point is that the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, which means the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the valid approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\nThe simplified equation becomes:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n**6.

Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nThe formation constant (K_f) is extremely large, which means the dissociation constant (K_d) is extremely small. This indicates that the complex is very stable and only a tiny fraction will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.

To find the concentration of free calcium ions, `Ca²⁺`, we must consider the dissociation of this complex. The relevant equilibrium reaction is:\n    `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:** The problem provides the formation constant, `K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰`. This constant applies to the formation reaction, which is the reverse of the dissociation:\n    `Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻`\n    The expression for `K_f` is:\n    `K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])`\n    We can use this expression directly, or we can calculate the dissociation constant, `K_d`, which is the inverse of `K_f`:\n    `K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹`\n\n3.  **Set up an Equilibrium Table (ICE Table):** We can track the concentrations as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of `Ca²⁺`.\n    *   **Initial:** `[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]` = 0.02 M; `[Ca²⁺]` = 0; `[EDTA⁴⁻]` = 0\n    *   **Change:** `[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]` decreases by x; `[Ca²⁺]` increases by x; `[EDTA⁴⁻]` increases by x.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** `[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]` = 0.02 - x; `[Ca²⁺]` = x; `[EDTA⁴⁻]` = x\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:** Using the formation constant `K_f`:\n    `K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)`\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²`\n\n5.  **Apply a Valid Approximation:** The formation constant `K_f` is extremely large. This indicates that the complex is very stable and the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be negligibly small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** The equation simplifies to:\n    `5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²`\n    Rearranging to solve for `x²`:\n    `x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n    `x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹² = 4 x 10⁻¹³`\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    `x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, `[Ca²⁺]`, is equal to x.\n    `[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    The calculated value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct Equilibrium:** The calculation must be based on the dissociation of the complex, as that is the source of the free `Ca²⁺` ions.\n*   **Correct Use of K:** One must either use the `K_f` expression correctly or calculate and use the `K_d` for the dissociation. Both methods lead to the same result.\n*   **Validity of Approximation:** The approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` is valid because `6.3 x 10⁻⁷` is many orders of magnitude smaller than `0.02`.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\":** This phrase is crucial as it allows the direct use of the given `K_f` without needing to account for the protonation of EDTA, which would introduce a pH-dependent conditional formation constant.\n*   **Matching Result to Option:** A common error in the candidate answers was correctly calculating the numerical value but then assigning it to the wrong letter option.
