The key piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a measurement to have a non-zero probability, the sum of the measured individual quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We compare the required sum for the final state with the value from the initial state: $-2 \\neq -1$. Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the measurement outcome is forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. The probability of such an event is exactly zero.\n\nThe reasoning across all provided answers is unanimously correct in reaching this conclusion. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are errors in mapping the result (0) to the given options. The correct probability is 0, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Quantum State\nThe system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital, meaning their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\nThe most important pieces of information from this state are:\n*   **l = 2**: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   **m = -1**: The magnetic quantum number for the *total* orbital angular momentum's z-component ($L_z$). This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and a measurement of this total component would yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n*   A measurement of $L_{1z}$ yielding $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the first electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   A measurement of $L_{2z}$ yielding $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the second electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nSo, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition\nA core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when combining individual angular momenta. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\nThis leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nFor a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the system's initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Consistency (The Careful Point)\nLet's check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, we compare the two values:\nIs $m = m_1 + m_2$?\nIs $-1 = -2$?\n\nThe condition is not met. The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m=-1$, while the desired final state has a total z-component corresponding to $m_{total}=-2$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nBecause the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of measuring an outcome that is forbidden by a conservation law is exactly zero.\n\nFormally, the probability is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$. This coefficient is non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 2/3\nD) 1/2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this quantum mechanics problem by applying the fundamental principles of angular momentum addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State's Properties**: The system is in the coupled state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. The most important piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, `m = -1`. This means the system has a definite, conserved value for the z-component of its total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Final State**: The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L_1z` and `L_2z` as `-ħ`. The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `m_q * ħ`, so this measurement corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Law**: A core principle of adding angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the quantum numbers: `m = m1 + m2`. A transition or measurement is only possible if this rule is satisfied.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: I will compare the total `m` from the initial state with the sum `m1 + m2` from the desired final state.\n    *   Initial state: `m = -1`.\n    *   Desired final state: `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: Since `m` is not equal to `m1 + m2`, the conservation law is violated. This means the probability of this measurement outcome is zero.\n\n6.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will match the calculated probability of 0 with the given options (A) 0, (B) 1/2, (C) 1, (D) 2/3 to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_angular_momentum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the quantum mechanics problem by applying the conservation of angular momentum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers from the problem statement.\n    # The initial coupled state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>.\n    # The total magnetic quantum number of the system is m.\n    m_initial = -1\n\n    # Step 2: Define the quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome.\n    # We want to measure the eigenvalue of L_1z as -ħ, which means m1 = -1.\n    # We want to measure the eigenvalue of L_2z as -ħ, which means m2 = -1.\n    m1_measured = -1\n    m2_measured = -1\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the fundamental selection rule for the addition of angular momentum.\n    # The probability is non-zero only if the z-component of angular momentum is conserved.\n    # This means the total magnetic quantum number 'm' must equal the sum of the\n    # individual magnetic quantum numbers 'm1' and 'm2'.\n    m_sum_measured = m1_measured + m2_measured\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.

This is a crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Final State:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the joint probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the desired final state after the measurement is the uncoupled state characterized by $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding individual angular momenta. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency (The Careful Point):** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. This means it is an impossible event.\n\n    The probability of measuring a system in a state that is orthogonal to its initial state is zero. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which represents the projection of the initial state onto the final state, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$, is zero because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This value represents the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the two-electron system. The state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for the first electron being $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for the second electron being $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    This means that for a system in a state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$, any measurement of the individual components $m_1$ and $m_2$ must yield values that sum to $m$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** Let's check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n    Therefore, it is impossible to start in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and measure the system to be in a state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The probability of this event is exactly zero.\n\n    This can also be understood in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$. This coefficient is zero because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied.\n\nThe correct answer is 0. Looking at the options:\nA) 2/3\nB) 0\nC) 1/2\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Initial State and the Measurement\n*   **Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state given by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. The crucial quantum numbers here are `l=2` (total orbital angular momentum) and `m=-1` (the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum). The fact that `m=-1` means the system has a definite, well-defined value for the z-component of its total angular momentum, which is `-1ħ`.\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of angular momentum for each electron, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalue `-ħ` for *both* `L₁z` and `L₂z`. An eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of -1. Therefore, the desired outcome is to find the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Relevant Physical Principle\nThe core principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components:\n`L_z = L₁z + L₂z`\n\nThis relationship for the operators implies a direct relationship for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis equation acts as a fundamental **selection rule**. A coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a superposition of uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>`. However, only the uncoupled states for which the sum `m₁ + m₂` equals `m` can be part of this superposition. If `m ≠ m₁ + m₂`, the probability of finding the system in that uncoupled state is zero.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Consistency\nLet's apply the selection rule to the values in the problem:\n*   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **`m = -1`**.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, we have **`m₁ = -1`** and **`m₂ = -1`**.\n*   The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the desired outcome is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\nNow, we compare the total `m` of the system with the sum required by the measurement outcome:\n`m` vs. `m₁ + m₂`\n`-1` vs. `-2`\n\nSince `-1 ≠ -2`, the selection rule is violated.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to `m=-1`. The desired final state has a total z-component corresponding to `m=-2`. Because the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible for a system in the state `|l=2, m=-1>` to be measured in the state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>`.\n\nThe probability of this event is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>`. Because the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is not satisfied, this coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is `|0|² = 0`.\n\nThe correct answer is 0. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the key points from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state given by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **`m = -1`**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum, `Lz = L₁z + L₂z`, with a well-defined eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L₁z` to be `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` to be `-ħ`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₂z` corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state `|m₁, m₂> = |-1, -1>`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n    Comparing the two values, we see that `m ≠ m₁ + m₂` (since `-1 ≠ -2`).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>` for which the sum `m₁ + m₂` is always equal to -1. The state `|-1, -1>` is not and cannot be a part of this superposition. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts with a state in the coupled basis `|l, m>` and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis `|m₁, m₂>`. The connection between them is governed by strict rules.\n*   **The `m = m₁ + m₂` Selection Rule:** This is the critical point of the problem. This rule is absolute. If it is not satisfied, the probability of transitioning between the corresponding states is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to see this is that the initial state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the `Lz` operator with eigenvalue `-1ħ`. The final state `|-1, -1>` is also an eigenstate of `Lz`, but with a different eigenvalue `-2ħ`. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like `Lz`) that correspond to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability is the square of the inner product of these states, which is zero for orthogonal states.\n\nAll the candidate answers that correctly apply the `m = m₁ + m₂` selection rule arrive at the correct physical conclusion that the probability is 0. The correct option corresponding to a probability of 0 is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties**: The two-electron system is in the coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. The most important quantum numbers for this problem are the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l=2$, and its projection on the z-axis, the total magnetic quantum number, $m=-1$. The fact that $m=-1$ means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and the Desired Final State**: A measurement is made of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is an uncoupled basis state represented by $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a measurement to have a non-zero probability, the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must check if the desired final state is consistent with the initial state's properties.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability**: We compare the value of $m$ from the initial state with the sum $m_1 + m_2$ from the desired final state.\n    *   Is $m = m_1 + m_2$?\n    *   Is $-1 = -2$? No.\n    Since the selection rule is violated, the transition from the initial state to this final state is forbidden. The probability of this measurement is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The problem starts with a state in the coupled basis ($|l, m>$) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$). The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute**: The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not an approximation but a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. If it is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the two states is exactly zero, and therefore the probability is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation**: A probability of zero means the event is impossible. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is a superposition of uncoupled states where $m_1+m_2=-1$ (specifically, the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1>$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0>$). The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not a component of this superposition and is orthogonal to the initial state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the joint probability is 0. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identify the Initial State of the System**\n\nThe problem states that the two-electron system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$: These are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the individual electrons, as they are in p-orbitals.\n*   $l = 2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the combined system.\n*   $m = -1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the **total** orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). This is a critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and a measurement of this total z-component would yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome**\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and getting $-\\hbar$ for both.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\nThis desired final state is an eigenstate of the individual operators and can be represented in the uncoupled basis as $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition**\n\nA core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of angular momentum. When adding angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components.\n*   Operator relationship: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n*   Quantum number relationship: $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis relationship acts as a strict **selection rule**. A coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$. However, this superposition will *only* contain uncoupled states for which the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. The probability of measuring any combination of $m_1$ and $m_2$ that violates this rule is zero.\n\n**4. Check for Consistency and Calculate the Probability**\n\nLet's apply the selection rule to this specific problem:\n*   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n*   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\nWe now compare the required total z-component from the initial state with the one implied by the final state:\nIs $m = m_1 + m_2$?\nIs $-1 = -2$?\n\nThe condition is not met. The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m=-1$, while the desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state with a total z-component of $m=-2$. This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is zero. The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and the final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ are orthogonal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. The most critical piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This value represents the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the two-electron system. The state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z$, with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Final State:** A measurement is made on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired final state is an uncoupled state represented by $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Principle:** In the addition of angular momentum, the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components. This is true for the operators ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$) and for their corresponding quantum numbers. This leads to a strict selection rule:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    For a measurement to have a non-zero probability, the sum of the measured individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state.\n\n4.  **Verify the Condition:** We must check if the selection rule is satisfied for the desired outcome.\n    *   From the initial state: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Comparing the two values, we see that **-1 ≠ -2**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:** Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition from the initial state to the desired final state is forbidden by the conservation of angular momentum. The probability of such an event is exactly zero.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly identify and apply the conservation rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. They all correctly conclude that the initial state has $m=-1$ while the desired final state corresponds to a sum of $m_1+m_2 = -2$. Therefore, all 15 candidates correctly reason that the probability must be 0.\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy in mapping this result to the final letter choice.\n*   The calculated probability is 0.\n*   The options are: A) 1, B) 1/2, C) 2/3, D) 0.\n*   The correct letter choice for a probability of 0 is **D**.\n\nWhile many candidates chose other letters, their physical reasoning was sound. The agents who chose 'D' (e.g., Answer 6 and Answer 7) provided both the correct reasoning and the correct final mapping.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Quantum State\nThe system consists of two electrons, and its state is described in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$: These are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the individual electrons, indicating they are in p-orbitals.\n*   $l = 2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the two-electron system.\n*   $m = -1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the **total** orbital angular momentum. It signifies that the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Measurement and the Desired Final State\nA measurement is performed on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis desired outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled basis state described by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition\nA core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of angular momentum. When adding angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nFor a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to be composed of an uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, this condition must be met. If it is not met, the probability of finding the system in that uncoupled state is zero.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Condition is Met\nLet's check the values for our specific problem:\n*   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, we compare the two values:\nIs $m = m_1 + m_2$?\nIs $-1 = -2$?\n\nThe condition is **not met**.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nBecause the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition from the initial state to the desired final state is forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics. The probability of such an event is exactly zero.\n\nThis can be formally stated using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which represent the projection of the coupled state onto the uncoupled basis. The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient:\n$P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero. Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nThe correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital ($l_1=1, l_2=1$). The system is in a *coupled angular momentum state* given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    *   Therefore, the desired final state is the *uncoupled state* described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.

The initial state has a total $m$ of -1, while the final state would require a total $m$ of -2. It is impossible for a measurement to find the system in a state that violates this conservation law.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability of this measurement is formally given by the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. A key property of these coefficients is that they are zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. This means their inner product is zero, and the probability of transitioning from one to the other upon measurement is zero.\n\nAll three perspectives lead to the same conclusion: the probability of this event is exactly 0.\n\nBased on the options provided:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 1/2\nD) 2/3\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the key points required for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties**: The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state given by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **`m = -1`**.

The measurement outcome `|m1, m2>` is described in the \"uncoupled basis,\" where the individual z-components are well-defined. The connection between these two bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The `m = m1 + m2` Selection Rule**: This is an absolute and exact rule that stems from the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. If this rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states is zero, and thus the probability is zero.

The desired final state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` is also an eigenstate of `Lz`, but with a different eigenvalue `(-1 + -1)ħ = -2ħ`. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like `Lz`) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal.

The key piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.

Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the measurement outcome is forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. The probability of such an event is exactly zero.\n\nThe reasoning across all provided answers is unanimously correct in reaching this conclusion. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are errors in mapping the result (0) to the given options. The correct probability is 0, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Quantum State\nThe system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital, meaning their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\nThe most important pieces of information from this state are:\n*   **l = 2**: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   **m = -1**: The magnetic quantum number for the *total* orbital angular momentum's z-component ($L_z$). This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and a measurement of this total component would yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n*   A measurement of $L_{1z}$ yielding $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the first electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   A measurement of $L_{2z}$ yielding $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the second electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nSo, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition\nA core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when combining individual angular momenta. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\nThis leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nFor a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the system's initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Consistency (The Careful Point)\nLet's check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n*   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, we compare the two values:\nIs $m = m_1 + m_2$?\nIs $-1 = -2$?\n\nThe condition is not met. The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m=-1$, while the desired final state has a total z-component corresponding to $m_{total}=-2$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nBecause the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of measuring an outcome that is forbidden by a conservation law is exactly zero.\n\nFormally, the probability is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$. This coefficient is non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 2/3\nD) 1/2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this quantum mechanics problem by applying the fundamental principles of angular momentum addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State's Properties**: The system is in the coupled state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. The most important piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, `m = -1`. This means the system has a definite, conserved value for the z-component of its total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Final State**: The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L_1z` and `L_2z` as `-ħ`. The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `m_q * ħ`, so this measurement corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Law**: A core principle of adding angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the quantum numbers: `m = m1 + m2`. A transition or measurement is only possible if this rule is satisfied.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: I will compare the total `m` from the initial state with the sum `m1 + m2` from the desired final state.\n    *   Initial state: `m = -1`.\n    *   Desired final state: `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: Since `m` is not equal to `m1 + m2`, the conservation law is violated. This means the probability of this measurement outcome is zero.\n\n6.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will match the calculated probability of 0 with the given options (A) 0, (B) 1/2, (C) 1, (D) 2/3 to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_angular_momentum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the quantum mechanics problem by applying the conservation of angular momentum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers from the problem statement.\n    # The initial coupled state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>.\n    # The total magnetic quantum number of the system is m.\n    m_initial = -1\n\n    # Step 2: Define the quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome.\n    # We want to measure the eigenvalue of L_1z as -ħ, which means m1 = -1.\n    # We want to measure the eigenvalue of L_2z as -ħ, which means m2 = -1.\n    m1_measured = -1\n    m2_measured = -1\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the fundamental selection rule for the addition of angular momentum.\n    # The probability is non-zero only if the z-component of angular momentum is conserved.\n    # This means the total magnetic quantum number 'm' must equal the sum of the\n    # individual magnetic quantum numbers 'm1' and 'm2'.\n    m_sum_measured = m1_measured + m2_measured\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.

This is a crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Final State:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the joint probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the desired final state after the measurement is the uncoupled state characterized by $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding individual angular momenta. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency (The Careful Point):** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. This means it is an impossible event.\n\n    The probability of measuring a system in a state that is orthogonal to its initial state is zero. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which represents the projection of the initial state onto the final state, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$, is zero because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This value represents the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the two-electron system. The state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for the first electron being $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for the second electron being $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    This means that for a system in a state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$, any measurement of the individual components $m_1$ and $m_2$ must yield values that sum to $m$.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** Let's check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$). This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n    Therefore, it is impossible to start in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and measure the system to be in a state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The probability of this event is exactly zero.\n\n    This can also be understood in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$. This coefficient is zero because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied.\n\nThe correct answer is 0. Looking at the options:\nA) 2/3\nB) 0\nC) 1/2\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Initial State and the Measurement\n*   **Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state given by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. The crucial quantum numbers here are `l=2` (total orbital angular momentum) and `m=-1` (the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum). The fact that `m=-1` means the system has a definite, well-defined value for the z-component of its total angular momentum, which is `-1ħ`.\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of angular momentum for each electron, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalue `-ħ` for *both* `L₁z` and `L₂z`. An eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of -1. Therefore, the desired outcome is to find the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Relevant Physical Principle\nThe core principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components:\n`L_z = L₁z + L₂z`\n\nThis relationship for the operators implies a direct relationship for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis equation acts as a fundamental **selection rule**. A coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a superposition of uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>`. However, only the uncoupled states for which the sum `m₁ + m₂` equals `m` can be part of this superposition. If `m ≠ m₁ + m₂`, the probability of finding the system in that uncoupled state is zero.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Consistency\nLet's apply the selection rule to the values in the problem:\n*   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **`m = -1`**.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, we have **`m₁ = -1`** and **`m₂ = -1`**.\n*   The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the desired outcome is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\nNow, we compare the total `m` of the system with the sum required by the measurement outcome:\n`m` vs. `m₁ + m₂`\n`-1` vs. `-2`\n\nSince `-1 ≠ -2`, the selection rule is violated.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to `m=-1`. The desired final state has a total z-component corresponding to `m=-2`. Because the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible for a system in the state `|l=2, m=-1>` to be measured in the state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>`.\n\nThe probability of this event is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>`. Because the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is not satisfied, this coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is `|0|² = 0`.\n\nThe correct answer is 0. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the key points from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state given by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **`m = -1`**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum, `Lz = L₁z + L₂z`, with a well-defined eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L₁z` to be `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` to be `-ħ`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₂z` corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state `|m₁, m₂> = |-1, -1>`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n    Comparing the two values, we see that `m ≠ m₁ + m₂` (since `-1 ≠ -2`).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>` for which the sum `m₁ + m₂` is always equal to -1. The state `|-1, -1>` is not and cannot be a part of this superposition. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts with a state in the coupled basis `|l, m>` and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis `|m₁, m₂>`. The connection between them is governed by strict rules.\n*   **The `m = m₁ + m₂` Selection Rule:** This is the critical point of the problem. This rule is absolute. If it is not satisfied, the probability of transitioning between the corresponding states is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to see this is that the initial state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the `Lz` operator with eigenvalue `-1ħ`. The final state `|-1, -1>` is also an eigenstate of `Lz`, but with a different eigenvalue `-2ħ`. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like `Lz`) that correspond to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability is the square of the inner product of these states, which is zero for orthogonal states.\n\nAll the candidate answers that correctly apply the `m = m₁ + m₂` selection rule arrive at the correct physical conclusion that the probability is 0. The correct option corresponding to a probability of 0 is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties**: The two-electron system is in the coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. The most important quantum numbers for this problem are the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l=2$, and its projection on the z-axis, the total magnetic quantum number, $m=-1$. The fact that $m=-1$ means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and the Desired Final State**: A measurement is made of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is an uncoupled basis state represented by $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a measurement to have a non-zero probability, the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must check if the desired final state is consistent with the initial state's properties.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability**: We compare the value of $m$ from the initial state with the sum $m_1 + m_2$ from the desired final state.\n    *   Is $m = m_1 + m_2$?\n    *   Is $-1 = -2$? No.\n    Since the selection rule is violated, the transition from the initial state to this final state is forbidden. The probability of this measurement is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The problem starts with a state in the coupled basis ($|l, m>$) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$). The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute**: The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not an approximation but a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. If it is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the two states is exactly zero, and therefore the probability is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation**: A probability of zero means the event is impossible. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is a superposition of uncoupled states where $m_1+m_2=-1$ (specifically, the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1>$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0>$). The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not a component of this superposition and is orthogonal to the initial state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the joint probability is 0.

This is a critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator, and a measurement of this total z-component would yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome**\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and getting $-\\hbar$ for both.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\nThis desired final state is an eigenstate of the individual operators and can be represented in the uncoupled basis as $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**3.

A coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$. However, this superposition will *only* contain uncoupled states for which the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.

The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m=-1$, while the desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state with a total z-component of $m=-2$. This violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is zero. The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and the final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ are orthogonal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. The most critical piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**.

The agents who chose 'D' (e.g., Answer 6 and Answer 7) provided both the correct reasoning and the correct final mapping.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Quantum State\nThe system consists of two electrons, and its state is described in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$: These are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the individual electrons, indicating they are in p-orbitals.\n*   $l = 2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the two-electron system.\n*   $m = -1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the **total** orbital angular momentum. It signifies that the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Measurement and the Desired Final State\nA measurement is performed on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis desired outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled basis state described by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition\nA core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of angular momentum. When adding angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nFor a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to be composed of an uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, this condition must be met. If it is not met, the probability of finding the system in that uncoupled state is zero.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Condition is Met\nLet's check the values for our specific problem:\n*   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow, we compare the two values:\nIs $m = m_1 + m_2$?\nIs $-1 = -2$?\n\nThe condition is **not met**.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nBecause the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition from the initial state to the desired final state is forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics. The probability of such an event is exactly zero.\n\nThis can be formally stated using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which represent the projection of the coupled state onto the uncoupled basis. The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient:\n$P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero. Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nThe correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital ($l_1=1, l_2=1$).

The initial state has a total $m$ of -1, while the final state would require a total $m$ of -2. It is impossible for a measurement to find the system in a state that violates this conservation law.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability of this measurement is formally given by the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. A key property of these coefficients is that they are zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. Since the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.
