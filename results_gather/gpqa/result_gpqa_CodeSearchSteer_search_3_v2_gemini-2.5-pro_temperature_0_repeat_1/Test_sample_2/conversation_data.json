    "The expectation value of an operator in a given quantum state is calculated by \"sandwiching\" the operator between the bra and ket of the state. The state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nHere, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the Pauli matrix σ_z. In matrix form, they are represented as:\n\n|↑⟩ =\n|↓⟩ =\n\nThe state vector |ψ⟩ can therefore be written as:\n\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nThe operator for which we need to find the expectation value is:\n\nO = 10σ_z + 5σ_x\n\nThe Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x are given by:\n\nσ_z = [, [0, -1]]\nσ_x = [,]\n\nFirst, we construct the operator matrix O:\n\nO = 10 * [, [0, -1]] + 5 * [,]\nO = [, [0, -10]] + [,]\nO = [, [5, -10]]\n\nThe expectation value ⟨O⟩ is given by the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector |ψ⟩. Since the components are real, it is simply the transpose:\n\n⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nNow, we can calculate the expectation value:\n\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [, [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]\n\nFirst, multiply the matrix O by the ket |ψ⟩:\n\nO|ψ⟩ = [, [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]\nO|ψ⟩ = [10*0.5 + 5*(√3/2), 5*0.5 - 10*(√3/2)]\nO|ψ⟩ = [5 + 2.5√3, 2.5 - 5√3]\n\nNext, multiply the resulting vector by the bra ⟨ψ|:\n\n⟨O⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] . [5 + 2.5√3, 2.5 - 5√3]\n⟨O⟩ = 0.5 * (5 + 2.5√3) + (√3/2) * (2.5 - 5√3)\n⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 1.25√3 + 1.25√3 - (5*3)/2\n⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 2.5√3 - 7.5\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nThis value, when rounded to one decimal place, is -0.7.\n\nAlternatively, due to the linearity of operators, the expectation value can be calculated as:\n\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n\nFirst, calculate the expectation value of σ_z:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = |0.5|² * (+1) + |√3/2|² * (-1)\n⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, calculate the expectation value of σ_x:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [,] * [0.5, √3/2]\n⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]\n⟨σ_x⟩ = 0.5 * (√3/2) + (√3/2) * 0.5 = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2\n\nFinally, combine the expectation values:\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 ≈ -0.67\n\nRounded to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
