    "The probability of an atomic nucleus decaying is governed by the principles of exponential decay. A fundamental aspect of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the nucleus has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not alter its intrinsic decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The probability of decay, P(t), within a certain time, t, is given by the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where 'e' is the base of the natural logarithm and 'λ' is the decay constant. We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n\n    P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\n    By rearranging the formula, we can solve for the survival probability:\n\n    e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability for the new time interval:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, this is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n\n    P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n3.  **Solve for the unknown probability:** We can solve this without explicitly calculating λ. We can express e^(-150λ) in terms of e^(-100λ):\n\n    e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(1.5) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Now, we calculate the value:\n\n    (0.68)^1.5 = (0.68) * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\n4.  **Final probability:** Substitute this value back into the probability formula:\n\n    P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
