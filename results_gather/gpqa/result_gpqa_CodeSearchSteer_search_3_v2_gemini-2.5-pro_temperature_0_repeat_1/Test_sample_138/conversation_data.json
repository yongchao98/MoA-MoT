    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for synthesizing α-diketones (1,2-diketones). The reagents generate nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. The reaction proceeds through the nitrosation of the ketone at the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This typically occurs via the enol form of the ketone, which acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic nitrosonium ion (NO⁺). The initial product is an α-nitroso ketone, which then tautomerizes to a more stable α-oximino ketone (an oxime). Subsequent hydrolysis of this oxime yields the final α-diketone product.\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the starting ketone must have at least one hydrogen atom on an α-carbon. If there are two different α-carbons with hydrogens (e.g., in an unsymmetrical ketone), the reaction preferentially occurs at the more substituted carbon, or at a methylene (-CH₂-) group over a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\nLet's analyze the two specific transformations:\n\n**Reaction A: A + (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe product is an α-diketone. Based on the reaction mechanism, the starting material A should be a ketone that can be oxidized at the adjacent carbon.\n*   **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one** is the logical precursor. The carbonyl group is at the C1 position. The α-carbons are C2 and C6, both of which are methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Nitrosation at either C2 or C6, followed by hydrolysis, would result in the formation of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n*   The other options for A, such as 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, are alcohols and are not suitable starting materials for this specific transformation to an α-diketone using these reagents.\n\n**Reaction B: B + (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nThe product is again an α-diketone. The starting material B should be a ketone.\n*   **5-methylhexan-2-one** has a carbonyl group at the C2 position. Its α-carbons are C1 (a methyl group, -CH₃) and C3 (a methylene group, -CH₂-). The reaction favors oxidation at the methylene group (C3) over the methyl group (C1). Therefore, treatment of 5-methylhexan-2-one with nitrous acid will lead to the formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n*   The other options for B, like 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol, are diols. While diols can be oxidized to diketones, it typically requires different oxidizing agents, not NaNO₂/HCl.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one and starting material B is 5-methylhexan-2-one.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
