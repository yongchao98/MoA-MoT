    "The correct reagents for the given reactions are selected based on the principles of cyanohydrin formation and nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of cyanohydrin formation. The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n1.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a potent nucleophile from the dissociation of NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the carbon-oxygen pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is then protonated by a proton source to form the final product, a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent 'A' must provide this proton. An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, is the standard method to achieve this protonation.\n\nTherefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either acid or base. In an acidic medium, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Strong mineral acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) are typically used with water and heat to ensure the complete hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n\nTherefore, **B = HCl** is a suitable reagent for this conversion.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct set of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
