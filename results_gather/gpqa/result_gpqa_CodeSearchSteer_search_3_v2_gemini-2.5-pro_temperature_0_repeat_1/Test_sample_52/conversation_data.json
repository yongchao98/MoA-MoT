    "To determine the correct chemical formula, we must systematically analyze the structural fragments indicated by the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this structure is therefore a C6H4 fragment. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with signals for aromatic protons.\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an ester functional group, which has the chemical structure -COO-. This adds two oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n3.  **Vinyl-H and -CH3 Groups (¹H NMR):**\n    *   There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). The splitting pattern described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). In this group, one vinyl proton is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet), and the second vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a doublet of quartets). This fragment has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH3) groups. One of these belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Given that an ester has the structure R-COO-R', and the main body of the molecule is the substituted aromatic ring, the most logical structure for the ester is a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n4.  **No -CH2 Groups:** The explicit absence of signals for methylene (-CH2-) groups is a crucial constraint that helps eliminate other possible structures.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n*   A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (Formula: C3H5)\n*   A methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH3** (Formula: COOCH3)\n\nCombining these fragments gives a structure such as methyl propenylbenzoate (the exact substitution pattern—ortho, meta, or para—does not affect the overall formula).\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we can sum the atoms from each fragment to determine the total chemical formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from -COOCH3) = 11 carbons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from -COOCH3) = 12 hydrogens\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from -COOCH3) = 2 oxygens\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Verification\n\nThis formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2). This matches the structure perfectly: 4 for the benzene ring (one ring and three double bonds), 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the carbonyl C=O double bond. The proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectral information. Other formulas, such as C12H14O2, would require adding a -CH2- group (for example, in an ethyl ester), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
