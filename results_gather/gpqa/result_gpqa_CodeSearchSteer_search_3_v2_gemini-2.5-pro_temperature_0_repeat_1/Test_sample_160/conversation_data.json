    "### Analysis of the Mean Free Path\n\nThe scenario involves comparing two different mean free paths within the same sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope:\n\n*   **λ1:** The mean free path of the remaining gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   **λ2:** The mean free path of the beam electrons scattering off these same gas molecules.\n\nThe key to understanding the relationship between λ1 and λ2 lies in the formula for the mean free path (λ), which is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ) and the number density of target particles (n).\n\nThe general formula is: **λ = 1 / (n * σ)**\n\nIn this situation, the number density (n) of the residual gas molecules is constant for both calculations. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** When gas molecules collide with each other, they are all in random thermal motion. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this relative motion must be accounted for. The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule among other identical molecules is:\n    **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)**\n    Here, σ_gas-gas is the collision cross-section for two gas molecules. If we consider the molecules as hard spheres with a diameter 'd', the cross-section is σ_gas-gas = πd².\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2):** The electrons in the beam are accelerated to a very high velocity (due to the 1000 kV accelerating voltage), making them much faster than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. In this case, the gas molecules can be considered almost stationary targets. Furthermore, the physical size of an electron is negligible compared to a gas molecule. The collision cross-section, σ_e-gas, is therefore determined primarily by the size of the gas molecule, which is approximately σ_e-gas ≈ π(d/2)² = πd²/4. Because the target molecules are essentially at rest relative to the high-speed electrons, the √2 factor is not present in the formula.\n    **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)**\n\n### Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nLet's establish the relationship between the two mean free paths by comparing their formulas:\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²)\n*   λ2 ≈ 1 / (n * πd²/4) = 4 / (n * πd²)\n\nNow, let's look at the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [4 / (n * πd²)] / [1 / (√2 * n * πd²)] = 4√2\n\nλ2 ≈ 4√2 * λ1 ≈ 5.656 * λ1\n\nThis calculation shows that the mean free path for an electron scattering off gas molecules (λ2) is significantly larger than the mean free path for gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1). The primary reasons for this are:\n\n*   **Smaller Collision Cross-Section:** The effective area for an electron-molecule collision is smaller than for a molecule-molecule collision.\n*   **Stationary Target Approximation:** The high velocity of the electrons means the random motion of the gas molecules (which increases their collision probability with each other) is negligible, removing the √2 factor and further increasing the electron's mean free path.\n\nGiven the result that λ2 is approximately 5.6 times λ1, we can evaluate the given options. Option D, which states λ2 < λ1, is the correct conclusion based on this analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
