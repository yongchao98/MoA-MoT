    "The reaction in question is a-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically a 3-aza-Cope rearrangement. The substrate, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, contains the necessary 1,5-diene system required for this transformation.\n\nThe rearranging system is `C5=C6-C1-N2-CH=CH2`. The Cope rearrangement proceeds through a concerted mechanism, typically via a chair-like transition state, involving the breaking of a sigma bond and the formation of a new one, with a corresponding shift of two pi bonds.\n\nThe bond changes are as follows:\n1.  The sigma bond between C1 and N2 (the bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the diene system) is broken.\n2.  A new sigma bond is formed between C5 and the terminal carbon of the vinyl group (the bond between atoms 1 and 6 of the diene system).\n3.  The double bond from the vinyl group shifts to form an imine double bond between N2 and the adjacent vinyl carbon.\n4.  The double bond from the bicycloheptene ring (C5=C6) shifts to the C1=C6 position.\n\nThis process opens the original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring system and forms a new fused bicyclic system. The product consists of a five-membered ring fused to a six-membered ring, which is a derivative of an azaindane, specifically a cyclopenta[c]pyridine.\n\nWhile the detailed analysis of the resulting connectivity and its correct IUPAC nomenclature can be complex, this specific reaction is known in the chemical literature. The product formed is 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine. This corresponds to the structure where the original bicyclic framework has rearranged into a fused cyclopentene and dihydropyridine ring system.\n\n<<<A>>>"
