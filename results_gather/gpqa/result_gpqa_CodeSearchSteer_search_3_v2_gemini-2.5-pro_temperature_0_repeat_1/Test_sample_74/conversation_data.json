    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of protein translation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the N-terminus and the HA tag:** The construct is designed to have an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The standard amino acid sequence for this tag is Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic Acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic Acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA). The provided DNA sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon for Methionine. Let's translate the subsequent codons:\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    This sequence correctly codes for the HA tag immediately following the initial Methionine. So far, the construct appears correct.\n\n2.  **Analyze the sequence immediately following the HA tag:** The DNA sequence continues with `AAATGA...`. Let's read this part in triplet codons:\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   `TGA` -> **Stop Codon**\n\n3.  **Identify the problem:** The codon `TGA` is one of the three universal stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`) that signal the termination of protein synthesis. Its presence immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and a single Lysine codon means that the ribosome will stop translation at this point. This is a form of nonsense mutation. Consequently, only a very short, non-functional peptide (Met-HA-tag-Lys) would be produced, and the intended GADD45G protein would not be synthesized at all.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This is incorrect. The stop codon in the sequence is TGA (UGA in mRNA), not TAA (UAA in mRNA). Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation.\n    *   B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While linkers can be important, the primary issue here is not protein degradation (proteolysis) but a complete failure to synthesize the full-length protein.\n    *   C) The ribosome terminated the translation early: This is the correct conclusion. The premature `TGA` stop codon halts translation before the GADD45G coding sequence is read.\n    *   D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: This is incorrect. As analyzed in step 1, the DNA sequence for the HA tag correctly corresponds to the proper amino acid sequence.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a premature stop codon causing translation to halt, which perfectly explains the inability to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\n<<<C>>>"
