    "To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 (³Li) nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we must first calculate its rest energy and then apply the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Mass of the Nucleus\n\nThe nucleus in question is Lithium with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, which is the isotope Lithium-6 (⁶Li). For this calculation, we will sum the masses of its constituent particles. This approach is a common simplification that ignores the mass defect due to nuclear binding energy.\n\n*   **Mass of a proton (mₚ):** Approximately 938.27 MeV/c².\n*   **Mass of a neutron (mₙ):** Approximately 939.57 MeV/c².\n\nThe total rest mass (m₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus is the sum of the masses of its 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\nm₀ = 3 * mₚ + 3 * mₙ\nm₀c² = 3 * (938.27 MeV) + 3 * (939.57 MeV)\nm₀c² = 2814.81 MeV + 2818.71 MeV\nm₀c² = 5633.52 MeV\n\nConverting this to Giga-electronvolts (GeV):\nm₀c² = 5.63352 GeV\n\n### 2. Calculate the Relativistic Energy\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation:\nE = γ * m₀c²\n\nWhere:\n*   **m₀c²** is the rest energy we calculated above.\n*   **γ (Lorentz factor)** is calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven the speed (v) is 0.96c:\n*   v²/c² = (0.96c)² / c² = 0.9216\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy:\nE = 3.5714 * 5.63352 GeV\nE ≈ 20.1197 GeV\n\n### 3. Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated energy is approximately 20.120 GeV. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (about 0.06%) can be attributed to the use of slightly different values for the proton and neutron masses in the problem's original source.\n\n<<<B>>>"
