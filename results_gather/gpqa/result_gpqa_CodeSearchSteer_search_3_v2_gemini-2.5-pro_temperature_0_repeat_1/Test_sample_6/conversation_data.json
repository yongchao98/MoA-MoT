    "The physical process in question is pair production, where two photons annihilate to create an electron-positron pair. For this to occur, the total energy of the two photons in their center-of-mass frame must be at least equal to the combined rest mass energy of the electron and positron.\n\nThe condition for the threshold energy is given by the formula:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} \\geq (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\nThis formula applies to a head-on collision, which provides the minimum threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray.\n\nThe known values are:\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV, which is equal to $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) is given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n\nTo find the threshold energy of the gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$), we can rearrange the formula:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the options in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), so we need to convert our result:\n$1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis result is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
