    "An N-sided polygon with apothems of a constant length 'a' will approach a circle of radius 'a' as N approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nIn the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(ρ). The minima occur when:\n\nρ = (2πa/λ) * sin(θ)\n\nwhere:\n*   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   θ is the angle of diffraction.\n\nThe problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for minima thus becomes:\n\nρ = (2πa/λ) * θ\n\nThe minima of the diffraction pattern correspond to the zeros of the J₁(ρ) function. The first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(ρ) are approximately:\n*   ρ₁ = 3.8317\n*   ρ₂ = 7.0156\n\nThe angular positions of the first two minima (θ₁ and θ₂) can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the first minimum (θ₁):\nθ₁ = ρ₁ * λ / (2πa) = 3.8317 * λ / (2πa) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n\nFor the second minimum (θ₂):\nθ₂ = ρ₂ * λ / (2πa) = 7.0156 * λ / (2πa) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between these first two minima is the difference between θ₂ and θ₁:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<C>>>"
