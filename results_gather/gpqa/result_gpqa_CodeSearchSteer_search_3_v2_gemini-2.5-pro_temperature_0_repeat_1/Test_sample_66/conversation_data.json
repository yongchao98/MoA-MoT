    "In quantum mechanics, the state of a system with multiple sources of angular momentum can be described in two ways: the uncoupled basis and the coupled basis. The problem provides the state in the coupled basis and asks for a measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis.\n\n### Analysis of the State and Measurement\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state denoted by `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. Here:\n    *   `l1 = 1` and `l2 = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals).\n    *   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   `m = -1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Measurement**: A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L1z` and `L2z`, is performed. We want to find the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalues `-ħ` for `L1z` and `-ħ` for `L2z`.\n\n3.  **Measurement Outcome State**: The eigenvalues of the `Lz` operator are given by `mħ`. Therefore, measuring `-ħ` for `L1z` corresponds to finding the first electron in the state with `m1 = -1`. Similarly, measuring `-ħ` for `L2z` corresponds to finding the second electron in the state with `m2 = -1`. The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state `|l1, m1>|l2, m2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>`.\n\n### The Role of the Total Angular Momentum Operator\n\nThe operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: `Lz = L1z + L2z`.\n\n*   The initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the total `Lz` operator with an eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`. A measurement of the total `Lz` on this state will always yield `-1ħ`.\n*   The measurement outcome state `|1, -1>|1, -1>` is also an eigenstate of the total `Lz` operator. Its eigenvalue is `(m1 + m2)ħ = (-1 + -1)ħ = -2ħ`.\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is found by calculating the squared magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the outcome state.\n\nProbability `P = |< ( |1, -1>|1, -1> ) | ( |1, 1, 2, -1> ) >|^2`\n\nThe coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|m1, m2>` using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. A crucial rule for these coefficients to be non-zero is that the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number (`m = m1 + m2`).\n\nThe initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is a superposition of uncoupled states `|m1, m2>` where `m1 + m2 = -1`. The possible combinations for `(m1, m2)` are `(0, -1)` and `(-1, 0)`.\n\nThe state we are measuring for, `|1, -1>|1, -1>`, has `m1 + m2 = -2`.\n\nBecause the initial state (with total `m = -1`) and the outcome state (with total `m = -2`) are eigenstates of the same operator (`Lz`) but with different eigenvalues (`-1ħ` and `-2ħ` respectively), they are orthogonal. This means their inner product is zero.\n\n`< ( |1, -1>|1, -1> ) | ( |1, 1, 2, -1> ) > = 0`\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
