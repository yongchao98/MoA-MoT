    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants B, D, and Product H:**\n    *   Reaction 4 states that gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. A classic example of this is the reaction of ethylene (C₂H₄) with chlorine (Cl₂) to produce 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), a common solvent.\n    *   Let's assume:\n        *   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)\n        *   D = C₂H₄ (Ethylene gas)\n        *   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n2.  **Identify Solid A and Product C:**\n    *   Reaction 1 states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) to form the bright red product C.\n    *   Let's consider A to be elemental sulfur (S₈), which is a solid. Sulfur reacts with excess chlorine in a two-step process. The overall reaction can be written as S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂.\n    *   The product, sulfur dichloride (SCl₂), is described as a cherry-red liquid. This fits the description of a \"bright red product C\".\n    *   So, we can identify:\n        *   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n        *   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n\n3.  **Verify the Hydrolysis Reaction:**\n    *   Reaction 3 states that C reacts with water to reform A, plus a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n    *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a disproportionation reaction. A balanced equation for the reaction is 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S.\n    *   This reaction reforms elemental sulfur (A = S₈).\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid (F).\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (G).\n    *   This perfectly matches the description.\n\n4.  **Identify the Hazardous Product E:**\n    *   Reaction 2 states that C (SCl₂) reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (C₂H₄) to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n    *   The product, bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n    *   Therefore, E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas).\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E, mustard gas.\n    *   The molecule has the structure Cl-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₂-CH₂-Cl. The C-S-C group is bent, similar to water, due to the lone pairs on the sulfur atom.\n    *   Due to rotational freedom around the single bonds, the molecule adopts a preferred low-energy conformation. This conformation is not planar.\n    *   The molecule lacks an inversion center and any mirror planes (σ).\n    *   However, it possesses a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. The two chloroethyl arms are positioned as rotational images of each other.\n    *   A molecule that has only a C₂ axis of symmetry belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
