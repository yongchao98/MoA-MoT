    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major):** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D (carbon-deuterium) bond. Therefore, the amide anion will preferentially abstract the proton from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored step. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position. This intermediate is 3-deuterobenzyne.\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** Although less likely, it is possible for the amide anion to abstract the deuteron from the C2 position. This would lead to the formation of a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed, resulting in a non-deuterated benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Attack on 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   If the amide attacks C1, the resulting anion at C6 is protonated to form **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   If the amide attacks C6, the resulting anion at C1 is protonated to form **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The amide can attack either C1 or C2 of the non-deuterated benzyne. In either case, after protonation, the product is simply **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products:\n\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
