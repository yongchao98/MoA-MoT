    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nFirst, we need the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is estimated to be about 160,000 to 163,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use the approximate value of 160,000 light-years.\n\nThe spacecraft travels at a constant speed (v) of 0.99999987 times the speed of light (c).\n\n**1. Time from Earth's perspective:**\nFirst, we calculate the travel time from the perspective of an observer on Earth.\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime (Earth) = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, the time taken is approximately 160,000.02 years.\n\n**2. Time Dilation:**\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving observer passes slower than for a stationary observer. This effect is known as time dilation and is described by the formula:\n\nt' = t * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   t' is the time experienced by the moving astronaut.\n*   t is the time measured by the stationary observer (on Earth).\n*   v is the velocity of the spacecraft.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nLet's calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (t'):\n\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) = √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can find the astronaut's time:\nt' ≈ 160,000.02 years * 0.0005099\nt' ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis value is approximately 81 years.\n\nThe astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. The trip will take about 81 years from their perspective. Upon arrival at Earth, the astronaut will be approximately 22 + 81 = 103 years old. Since their average lifetime is 150 solar years, the astronaut will survive the journey.\n\nBased on the calculation, the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their point of view is approximately 81 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
