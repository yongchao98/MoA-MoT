    "The calculation steps were correct. The process involves:\n1.  **Normalizing the state vector**: A quantum state vector must be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle in any possible state is 1. For a state vector |ψ⟩ = (a, b), the normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² = 1. If it's not normalized, you divide the vector by the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components.\n2.  **Defining the spin operator**: The spin operator S_y is given by (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix σ_y.\n3.  **Calculating the expectation value**: The expectation value of an operator Â is calculated using the formula <Â> = <ψ|Â|ψ>, where |ψ> is the normalized state vector.\n\nLet's apply this to the given problem.\n\n**1. Normalize the spin state**\n\nThe unnormalized spin state is |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4).\nWe represent this as a column vector:\n|ψ⟩ =\n  ( 3i )\n  ( 4  )\n\nThe corresponding bra vector <ψ| is the conjugate transpose:\n<ψ| = (-3i, 4)\n\nFirst, we calculate the inner product <ψ|ψ>:\n<ψ|ψ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nTo normalize the state, we divide the vector by the square root of this value, which is √25 = 5.\nThe normalized state vector |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) *\n            ( 3i )\n            ( 4  )\n\nAnd the normalized bra vector <ψ_norm| is:\n<ψ_norm| = (1/5) * (-3i, 4)\n\n**2. Define the S_y operator**\n\nThe spin operator S_y is defined as:\nS_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) *\n                      ( 0  -i )\n                      ( i   0 )\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value <S_y>**\n\nThe expectation value is <S_y> = <ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩.\n\n<S_y> = [ (1/5) * (-3i, 4) ] * [ (ħ/2) * ( 0  -i ) ] * [ (1/5) * ( 3i ) ]\n                                       ( i   0 )           ( 4  )\n\nLet's combine the constants: (1/5) * (ħ/2) * (1/5) = ħ/50.\n\n<S_y> = (ħ/50) * (-3i, 4) * ( 0  -i ) * ( 3i )\n                             ( i   0 )   ( 4  )\n\nFirst, multiply the matrix and the column vector:\n( 0  -i ) * ( 3i ) = ( 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 ) = ( -4i )\n( i   0 )   ( 4  )   ( i*(3i) + 0*4   )   ( 3i² ) = ( -3 )\n\nNow, multiply the row vector by the resulting column vector:\n(-3i, 4) * ( -4i ) = (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) = 12i² - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24\n            ( -3  )\n\nFinally, multiply by the constant ħ/50:\n<S_y> = (ħ/50) * (-24) = -24ħ / 50 = -12ħ / 25.\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25. This matches a worked example found in the search results.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) 12*hbar/25\nC) 25*hbar/2\nD) -12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
