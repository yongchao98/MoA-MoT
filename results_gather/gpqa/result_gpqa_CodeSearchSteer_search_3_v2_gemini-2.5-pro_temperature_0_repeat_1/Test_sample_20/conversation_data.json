    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible structures that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is generally required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms that are part of the carbonyl groups do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. The other four carbons are sp2 hybridized and part of the double bonds. There are no alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon atom, which is a necessary condition for typical keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism. Shifting a hydrogen from one of the double-bonded carbons would result in a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds (an allene) within the ring.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is aromatic. In fact, the equilibrium often favors the aromatic enol form.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  an ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The chemical formula is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it is the trans-isomer. The molecule has a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers, as the double-bonded carbons are only bonded to three groups. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, exhibit geometric (cis/trans) isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
