    "A) **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** is a quantum field theory that famously requires regularization and renormalization to handle infinities that arise in calculations of physical quantities, such as the self-energy of the electron. These infinities, known as ultraviolet divergences, appear in loop diagrams which correspond to high-energy (short-distance) phenomena.\n\nB) **Classical Electrodynamics**, while not a quantum theory, also encounters infinities. The self-energy of a classical point-like electron is infinite. This problem, which arises from considering the energy of the electromagnetic field at infinitesimally small distances from the point charge, indicates a breakdown of the theory at high energy scales and necessitates a form of regularization or a modification of the theory.\n\nC) **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**, the theory of the strong nuclear force, is a non-Abelian gauge theory. Like QED, its perturbative calculations involve loop diagrams that lead to ultraviolet divergences. Therefore, QCD requires regularization and renormalization to make sense of these high-energy infinities.\n\nD) **Superstring Theory** is a theoretical framework that posits that the fundamental constituents of reality are one-dimensional \"strings\" rather than zero-dimensional point particles. A key feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free of the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. By replacing point-particle interactions with the interactions of extended strings, the theory effectively \"smears out\" the interaction points, thus avoiding the singularities that would otherwise require regularization. While the theory is complex and not yet experimentally verified, its potential to be a finite theory of quantum gravity without the need for high-energy regularization is one of its most significant motivations.\n\n<<<D>>>"
