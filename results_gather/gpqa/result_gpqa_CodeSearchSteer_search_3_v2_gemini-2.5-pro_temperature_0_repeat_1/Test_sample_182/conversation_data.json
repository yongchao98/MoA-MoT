    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the name to draw the structure and find its molecular formula.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which is the principal functional group and is assigned to position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nBased on this, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogens (H)**: We count the hydrogens attached to each carbon:\n    *   C1: 1H\n    *   C2: 1H\n    *   C3: 1H\n    *   C4: 1H\n    *   C5: 1H\n    *   C6: 2H\n    *   -COOH: 1H\n    *   -CHO: 1H\n    *   -CH=CH₂: 3H\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens (H₁₂).\n*   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group = 3 oxygens (O₃).\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to their corresponding alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   Ketones and alcohols are also reduced to alkanes.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting material:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 becomes a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** at C2 becomes a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **double bond** in the cyclohexene ring (C3=C4) becomes a **single bond**.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at C5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe resulting product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula of this product:\n*   **Carbons (C)**: The number of carbons remains the same, so 10 carbons (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogens (H)**: The product is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For C₁₀, this would be H₂₀.\n    *   Let's verify by counting: The structure is a cyclohexane ring with two methyl groups and one ethyl group. The formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   (Note: Halogens are treated like hydrogen, oxygens are ignored, and for each nitrogen, we add 1 to C and 1 to H).\n\nFor our product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nThe IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure (the cyclohexane ring) in the final product, as all double bonds have been saturated.\n\n<<<A>>>"
