    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the muon (μ+) and the neutrino (ν) resulting from the decay of a stationary positive pion (π+).\n\nThe decay process is: π+ → μ+ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (π+) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Rest mass of π+ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ+ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless (m_ν ≈ 0).\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation based on the principles of conservation of energy and momentum:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the pion is at rest, its initial energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    *   E_initial = m_π * c²\n    *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + KE_ν\n    *   Therefore, m_π * c² = KE_μ + m_μ * c² + KE_ν\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is:\n        KE_μ + KE_ν = (m_π - m_μ) * c² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum before the decay is zero, so the total momentum after must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.\n    *   p_initial = 0\n    *   p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0\n    *   Therefore, |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**: The relationship E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)² is used for the decay products.\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν² = (pc)² + 0, which simplifies to E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino has no rest mass, its total energy is its kinetic energy (KE_ν = pc).\n    *   For the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ * c²)². We also know that the total energy of the muon is E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ * c².\n\n4.  **Solving for the Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   From momentum conservation, we can substitute `pc` with `KE_ν` in the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n        (KE_μ + m_μ * c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   From energy conservation, we have KE_ν = 33.9 - KE_μ. Substituting this into the equation above:\n        (KE_μ + 105.7 MeV)² = (33.9 MeV - KE_μ)² + (105.7 MeV)²\n    *   Expanding both sides:\n        KE_μ² + 2 * (105.7) * KE_μ + (105.7)² = (33.9)² - 2 * (33.9) * KE_μ + KE_μ² + (105.7)²\n    *   Simplifying by canceling terms (KE_μ² and (105.7)²):\n        211.4 * KE_μ = 1149.21 - 67.8 * KE_μ\n    *   Solving for KE_μ:\n        (211.4 + 67.8) * KE_μ = 1149.21\n        279.2 * KE_μ = 1149.21\n        KE_μ ≈ 4.116 MeV\n    *   Now, we find the kinetic energy of the neutrino:\n        KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - KE_μ\n        KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.116 MeV ≈ 29.784 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches one of the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
