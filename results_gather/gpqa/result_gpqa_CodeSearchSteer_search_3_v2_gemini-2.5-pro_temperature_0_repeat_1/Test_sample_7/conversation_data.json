  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the relationship between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% reduction in resistance. This means G1 plays a role in the plant's defense.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function leads to a complete loss of resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a 50% reduction in resistance, suggesting G3 also contributes significantly to the defense mechanism.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants (Gene Interactions)\n\n1.  **Interaction with G2:**\n    *   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant, not an intermediate between g1 (75%) and g2 (0%). When the phenotype of a double mutant matches the phenotype of one of the single mutants, it indicates an epistatic interaction. In this case, the g2 mutation masks the effect of the g1 mutation. This means G2 is epistatic to G1.\n    *   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant. The g2 mutation masks the effect of the g3 mutation. Therefore, G2 is also epistatic to G3.\n\n2.  **Conclusion about G2:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must function upstream of both of them in the genetic pathway. A common way for one gene to control other genes is by acting as a transcription factor, which regulates the expression of other genes. The data strongly supports the conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor required to activate both G1 and G3.\n\n3.  **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   Let's compare this to the single mutants: g1 has 75% resistance and g3 has 50%. If the genes acted independently, the combined resistance might be expected to be higher than 10%. The fact that the double mutant is far more sensitive to the disease than either single mutant suggests that G1 and G3 have functions that are partially overlapping or \"redundant\". While both are important, the presence of one can partially compensate for the loss of the other. When both are knocked out, the pathway is almost completely disrupted. This synergistic effect is characteristic of gene redundancy.\n    *   The term pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits, which cannot be concluded from this experiment as only one trait (disease resistance) was measured.\n    *   The claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 would mean the g1g3 phenotype is the same as the g1 phenotype (75%), which is false. The claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 would mean the g1g3 phenotype is the same as the g3 phenotype (50%), which is also false.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** The claim that G3 is epistatic towards G1 is incorrect.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** We cannot conclude pleiotropy from the data, and the claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is incorrect.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** The claim that G1 is a transcription factor is incorrect; the data shows G2 is the upstream gene.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and accurately describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. Although the final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect based on a strict definition, the first two statements are the best description of the genetic interactions among all the choices.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option D provides the most accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment.\n\n<<<D>>>"
