    "For a decay of the boson X into a fermion-antifermion pair ($X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson X ($m_X$) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products. Since a fermion and its antifermion have identical masses ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition is:\n\n$m_X \\ge 2m_f$\n\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, the condition for a decay to be kinematically allowed is:\n\n$6 \\, \\text{GeV} \\ge 2m_f \\implies m_f \\le 3 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n\nTherefore, the boson X can only decay into pairs of fermions whose individual mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's examine the masses of the fundamental fermions:\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   **Electron ($e$):** The mass is approximately 0.511 MeV/c². This is much less than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$):** The mass is approximately 105.7 MeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$):** The mass is approximately 1777 MeV/c² or 1.777 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   **Up ($u$):** The mass is approximately 2.2 MeV/c². This is much less than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Down ($d$):** The mass is approximately 4.7 MeV/c². This is much less than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Strange ($s$):** The mass is approximately 95 MeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Charm ($c$):** The mass is approximately 1.27 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Bottom ($b$):** The mass is approximately 4.18 GeV/c². This is greater than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not allowed**.\n*   **Top ($t$):** The mass is approximately 172.76 GeV/c². This is much greater than 3 GeV. Thus, the decay $X\\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not allowed**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are into pairs of up, down, strange, and charm quarks, as well as electron, muon, and tau leptons.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This option includes all the allowed decays and excludes the forbidden ones.\n*   B) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This is incorrect as it includes the decay to bottom quarks.\n*   C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This is incorrect as it includes the decay to bottom quarks and omits the decay to muons.\n*   D) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This is incorrect as it includes the decay to top quarks.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
