    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, which means the protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. The integration of 3H indicates a methyl group (CH₃). A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of the methyl protons in an acetate group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is expected in all of them.\n\n2.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is in the alkene (vinylic) region.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant, *J* = 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are stereochemically dependent. A large coupling constant in the range of 11-18 Hz is characteristic of protons that are *trans* to each other across a double bond. A *cis* relationship would show a smaller coupling constant, typically between 6-15 Hz. This strongly indicates a *trans* configuration, which eliminates the *cis* isomers.\n\n3.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is also a vinylic proton.\n    *   The splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   The \"doublet\" part of the signal arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The \"quartet\" part arises from being coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4), which must be a methyl group (CH₃).\n\n4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H).\n    *   It is a doublet (d), which means it is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n    *   This corresponds to the methyl group on the double bond, which is coupling to the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\n*   From the J-value of 16.0 Hz, we know the compound has a **trans** double bond. This eliminates options A (Cis-propenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n*   The remaining options are B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-propenyl acetate).\n*   The signals at 5.5 ppm (dq) and 1.6 ppm (d) indicate a `CH₃-CH=` fragment. The vinylic proton is split into a quartet by the methyl group, and the methyl group is split into a doublet by the vinylic proton.\n*   This `CH₃-CH=` fragment is characteristic of a **propenyl** group, not a butenyl group. A trans-1-butenyl acetate (CH₃CH₂CH=CHOAc) would show signals for an ethyl group (a CH₂ and a CH₃), which are not present in the given data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data perfectly matches the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate** (CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃).\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** Acetate methyl group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz):** Vinylic proton next to the oxygen, coupled *trans* to the other vinylic proton.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** Vinylic proton next to the methyl group, coupled to the other vinylic proton and the three protons of the methyl group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** Methyl group on the double bond, coupled to the adjacent vinylic proton.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
