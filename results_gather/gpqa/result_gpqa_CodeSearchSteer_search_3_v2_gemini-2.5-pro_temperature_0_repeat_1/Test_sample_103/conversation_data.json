    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet, the wavelength of its spectral lines shifts. A larger periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight results in a larger periodic shift in the wavelength.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts.\n\n*   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7\n\n### 2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Period\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (mₚ), the star's mass (Mₛ), and the orbital period (P). The standard formula, derived from Kepler's laws of motion, is:\n\nK ∝ mₚ * Mₛ^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the two stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the two planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). This means that the terms for the masses are constant for both systems. Consequently, the relationship simplifies to:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis shows an inverse relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude and the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nFrom the relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can establish a ratio for the two systems:\n\n(K₂ / K₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nNow, we substitute the ratio of the wavelength shifts we found in the first step:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
