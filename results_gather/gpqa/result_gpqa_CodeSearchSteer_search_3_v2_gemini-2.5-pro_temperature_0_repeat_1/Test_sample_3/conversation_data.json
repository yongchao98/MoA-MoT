    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—exist, two of Maxwell's equations would be fundamentally different from their counterparts in our reality. These equations are the ones that describe the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\nIn our universe, the absence of magnetic monopoles is a fundamental principle encapsulated in Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ · **B**) is zero. This is because magnetic field lines are always closed loops; they never originate from or terminate on a single point. However, if a magnetic monopole were to exist, it would act as a source or a sink for the magnetic field, much like an electric charge does for the electric field. Consequently, the divergence of the magnetic field would no longer be zero but would be proportional to the magnetic charge density.\n\nFurthermore, the existence of magnetic monopoles would imply the possibility of a \"magnetic current.\" This would necessitate a modification of Faraday's law of induction. In our universe, Faraday's law (∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t) states that a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a current of these monopoles would also induce a circulating electric field, adding a new term to this equation.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<C>>>"
