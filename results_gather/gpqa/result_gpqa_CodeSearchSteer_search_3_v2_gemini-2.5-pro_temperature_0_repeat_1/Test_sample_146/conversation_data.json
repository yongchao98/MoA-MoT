    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\nThe fundamental principle we will use is the conservation of energy. In this annihilation process, the total energy before the event must equal the total energy after the event.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its kinetic energy as zero. The proton is assumed to be at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\n    The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass as a proton.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles ($2A^+ + 2A^-$). All four particles have the same mass, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. Since the initial momentum is zero, the final particles must be moving. Their energy is given by the relativistic energy formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. By symmetry, all four particles will have the same speed and thus the same $\\gamma$.\n\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 2. Calculating the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\nBy equating the initial and final energies, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Velocity (v)\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the velocity, $v$:\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
