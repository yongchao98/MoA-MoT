    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps involving stoichiometry and equilibrium principles.\n\n**1. Reaction and Stoichiometry**\n\nFirst, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid (represented by H+):\n\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions.\n\n**2. Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.867 g/mol.\n\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.867 g/mol = 9.357 x 10^-4 mol\n\n**3. Concentration of Fe3+**\n\nThis amount of Fe(OH)3 dissolves in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The concentration of the resulting Fe3+ ions will be:\n\n*   [Fe3+] = 9.357 x 10^-4 mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10^-3 M\n\n**4. Equilibrium and pH Calculation**\n\nFor the Fe(OH)3 to remain dissolved, the ion product [Fe3+][OH-]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 at 25°C is approximately 2.8 x 10^-39. We use this to find the maximum hydroxide concentration [OH-] allowed in the solution.\n\n*   Ksp = [Fe3+][OH-]³\n*   2.8 x 10^-39 = (9.357 x 10^-3) * [OH-]³\n*   [OH-]³ = (2.8 x 10^-39) / (9.357 x 10^-3) = 2.992 x 10^-37\n*   [OH-] = (2.992 x 10^-37)^(1/3) = 6.688 x 10^-13 M\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of H+ and the pH of the solution using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C).\n\n*   [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1.0 x 10^-14 / 6.688 x 10^-13 M = 0.01495 M\n*   pH = -log[H+] = -log(0.01495) = 2.825\n\nThis pH value is very close to 2.83. Let's re-evaluate with a slightly different Ksp value of 1.6 x 10^-39, which is also commonly cited.\n\n*   [OH-]³ = (1.6 x 10^-39) / (9.357 x 10^-3) = 1.710 x 10^-37\n*   [OH-] = (1.710 x 10^-37)^(1/3) = 5.55 x 10^-13 M\n*   [H+] = 1.0 x 10^-14 / 5.55 x 10^-13 M = 0.0180 M\n*   pH = -log(0.0180) = 2.74\n\nGiven the options, a pH of 2.83 is the most plausible target. Let's proceed with the pH of 2.83, which corresponds to an [H+] of 10^-2.83 = 1.479 x 10^-2 M.\n\n**5. Volume of Acid Required**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid added must do two things:\n*   Neutralize the Fe(OH)3.\n*   Provide the excess H+ ions to maintain the final pH.\n\n*   **Moles of H+ to neutralize Fe(OH)3:**\n    *   From stoichiometry, this is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.\n    *   Moles H+ (reaction) = 3 * 9.357 x 10^-4 mol = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ remaining in solution:**\n    *   This is the amount needed to create the acidic pH in the 100 cm³ solution.\n    *   Moles H+ (excess) = [H+]_final * Volume = (1.479 x 10^-2 M) * 0.1 L = 1.479 x 10^-3 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H+ needed:**\n    *   Total moles = Moles H+ (reaction) + Moles H+ (excess)\n    *   Total moles = 2.807 x 10^-3 + 1.479 x 10^-3 = 4.286 x 10^-3 mol\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this total number of moles.\n\n*   Volume = Total moles / Molarity = 4.286 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04286 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.04286 L * 1000 cm³/L = 42.86 cm³\n\nLet's re-examine the options. None of the options match this calculation. Let's re-calculate using the pH of 2.04 from option D.\n\n*   If pH = 2.04, then [H+] = 10^-2.04 = 0.00912 M.\n*   Moles H+ (excess) = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 9.12 x 10^-4 mol.\n*   Total moles H+ = (2.807 x 10^-3) + (9.12 x 10^-4) = 3.719 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   Volume of acid = 3.719 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³. This is not 28.05 cm³.\n\nLet's try working backwards from the volume in option D, 28.05 cm³.\n\n*   Moles of H+ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   From our calculation, the moles of H+ needed just to react with the Fe(OH)3 is 2.807 x 10^-3 mol.\n\nThese two values are almost identical. The slight difference is likely due to rounding of the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let's assume the moles of H+ added are entirely consumed by the reaction.\n\n*   Moles of H+ added = Moles of H+ reacted = 2.805 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   This implies that there are virtually no excess H+ ions left, which cannot be correct as the solution must be acidic to keep the Fe(OH)3 dissolved.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options. However, let's reconsider the initial stoichiometric calculation. The amount of acid required *just for the neutralization reaction* is:\n\n*   Moles H+ (reaction) = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol\n*   Volume of acid = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³\n\nThis volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option D. This suggests that the question assumes the amount of acid needed to lower the pH is negligible compared to the amount needed for the neutralization. If we accept this premise:\n\n*   The required volume is approximately 28.05 cm³.\n*   We must then determine the pH. After the neutralization, we have a solution of Fe3+ ions. Fe3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water:\n    Fe3+(aq) + 2H2O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)2+(aq) + H3O+(aq)\n*   To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe3+(aq). The Ka for Fe3+(aq) is approximately 6.3 x 10^-3.\n*   The concentration of Fe3+ is 9.357 x 10^-3 M.\n*   Ka = [Fe(OH)2+][H3O+] / [Fe3+] = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n*   6.3 x 10^-3 = x² / 0.009357\n*   x² = 5.895 x 10^-5\n*   x = [H3O+] = 7.68 x 10^-3 M\n*   pH = -log(7.68 x 10^-3) = 2.11\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.11 is very close to the pH of 2.04 provided in option D. The small discrepancies arise from using slightly different values for constants (molar mass, Ksp, Ka). Based on this analysis, option D is the most chemically consistent answer, assuming the volume is primarily for neutralization and the pH results from the hydrolysis of the Fe3+ product.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Volume: 28.05 cm³ is the stoichiometric amount for neutralization.\n*   pH: 2.04 is a reasonable pH for a ~0.009 M solution of Fe3+(aq).\n\n<<<D>>>"
