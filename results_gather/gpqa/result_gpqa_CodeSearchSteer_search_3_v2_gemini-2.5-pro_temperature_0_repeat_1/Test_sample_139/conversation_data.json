    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of regular water (H₂O) is 273.15 K. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K, a near-perfect match for 277 K. Therefore, **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The identification of B as D₂O and W as D₂ strongly suggests this isotope is deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) is violent and produces deuterium gas: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   In this reaction, Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would be the precipitate (G).\n    *   When precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, is heated, it decomposes to release heavy water (B, D₂O), according to the reaction: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is analogous to the thermal decomposition of aluminium hydroxide.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid with LiAlD₄ (a strong reducing agent) would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms. This confirms the chemical nature of X.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within the molecule. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of Aluminium (Al). The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses = 8 (from D) + 27 (from Al) = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
