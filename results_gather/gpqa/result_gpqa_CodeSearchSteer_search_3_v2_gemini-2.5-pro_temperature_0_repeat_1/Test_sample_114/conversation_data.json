    "The problem describes an electron-positron annihilation event and asks for the angle between the two resulting photons. This can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: First, we determine the total energy of the system before the collision. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e) = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p) = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum: E_initial = E_e + E_p = 6 * m_e * c².\n\n    After annihilation, this energy is converted into two photons of equal energy (E_ph).\n    *   E_final = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph.\n    *   By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final, so 6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_ph.\n    *   This gives the energy of each photon as E_ph = 3 * m_e * c².\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Next, we calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision. The momentum of a relativistic particle can be found using the energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e): (4m_ec²)² = (p_e c)² + (m_ec²)² → p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e * c. It moves from the left, so its momentum is in the positive direction.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p): (2m_ec²)² = (p_p c)² + (m_ec²)² → p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e * c. It moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative direction.\n    *   The total initial momentum (a vector sum) is P_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c along the horizontal axis.\n\n3.  **Photon Momentum and Angle**: The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n    *   Momentum of each photon (p_ph) = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n    *   Since the initial momentum is only horizontal, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Given that they have equal energy and are directed upper-right and lower-right, their angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite (let's call them θ and -θ).\n    *   The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the photon momenta: P_final = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n\n4.  **Solving for the Angle**: By conservation of momentum, P_initial = P_final.\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n    *   Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, we get cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568.\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°.\n\n5.  **Total Angle**: The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\n    *   Total Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°.\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
