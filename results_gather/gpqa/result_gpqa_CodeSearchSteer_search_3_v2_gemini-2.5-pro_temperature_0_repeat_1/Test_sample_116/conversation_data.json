    "To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must assess their molecular structures for sources of chirality, such as chiral centers or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of chirality called atropisomerism when there is hindered rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This typically occurs when there are bulky substituents at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this compound, the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two dimethyl carboxylate groups and two nitro groups. These large groups prevent the two rings from rotating freely, locking the molecule into a non-planar conformation. This restricted rotation results in two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making the compound optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Optical isomerism in this molecule arises from the presence of a chiral carbon atom (an asymmetric center). The carbon at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule chiral and therefore optically active. It exists as two enantiomers, methyl (R)-lactate and methyl (S)-lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. It does not contain a chiral center or any other element of chirality. Therefore, an individual molecule of benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), neither of these geometric isomers is optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are optically active. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) are not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
