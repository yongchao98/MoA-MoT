    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is common for 1,5-dienes.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   The main chain is \"nona,\" meaning it has 9 carbon atoms.\n    *   The \"-2,6-diene\" suffix indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   A \"5-butyl\" prefix means a butyl group (-C₄H₉) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is: CH₃–CH(2)=CH(3)–CH₂(4)–CH(5)(C₄H₉)–CH(6)=CH(7)–CH₂–CH₃.\n\n2.  **Recognize the reacting system:** The carbon skeleton C(2)=C(3)−C(4)−C(5)−C(6)=C(7) forms a 1,5-diene system, which is the requirement for a Cope rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope rearrangement mechanism:** This is a concerted pericyclic reaction that proceeds through a six-membered transition state. The bond changes are as follows:\n    *   The sigma bond between carbon 4 and carbon 5 breaks.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between carbon 2 and carbon 7.\n    *   The π-bond at C2=C3 moves to C3=C4.\n    *   The π-bond at C6=C7 moves to C5=C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the product's structure:** By tracing the new connections, we can assemble the product molecule.\n    *   The original methyl group (C1) is on C2.\n    *   The original ethyl group (C8-C9) is on C7.\n    *   The original butyl group is on C5.\n    *   The new structure is formed around the newly created C2-C7 bond. The resulting molecule is:\n        CH₂(4)=CH(3)–CH(2)(CH₃)–CH(7)(CH₂CH₃)–CH(6)=CH(5)(C₄H₉)\n\n5.  **Name the product using IUPAC nomenclature:**\n    *   First, identify the longest carbon chain that contains both double bonds. This chain starts from the CH₂= group (original C4) and extends through the butyl group, resulting in a 10-carbon chain (a decadiene).\n    *   Number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants. Starting from the CH₂= end gives the double bonds positions 1 and 5 (deca-1,5-diene).\n    *   Identify the substituents on this new chain. There is a methyl group on carbon 3 (original C2) and an ethyl group on carbon 4 (original C7).\n    *   Arrange the substituents alphabetically.\n\nThe final name of the product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nComparing this name with the given options:\nA) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\nB) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\nC) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nD) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\nThe correct product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
