    "To determine the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we apply the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the system, which is the sum of its kinetic energy, potential energy, and rest mass energy, remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the total energy at maximum amplitude:** At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$. At this point, the kinetic energy is zero. The total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the potential energy and the rest mass energy ($mc^2$). The potential energy ($U$) for a harmonic oscillator is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    $E_{total} = U(A) + mc^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2$\n\n2.  **Define the total energy at the equilibrium position:** At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero. The oscillator reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$. The total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the rest mass energy. The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    At maximum speed, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the law of conservation of energy:** The total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Divide the equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} + 1 = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n5.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:** Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ back into the equation:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, first invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
