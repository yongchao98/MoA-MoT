    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform distribution of stars in space.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (d). This relationship is given by the formula `d = 1/plx`, where d is typically measured in parsecs and plx in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's denote this constant star density as ρ.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars at a Given Distance:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space with a radius `d` and a small thickness `Δd`. The volume of this shell (`V_shell`) can be approximated by its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`Δd`):\n    `V_shell ≈ 4πd² * Δd`\n\n    The number of stars (`N`) within this shell is the star density (ρ) multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    `N(d) ≈ ρ * 4πd² * Δd`\n    Since ρ and 4π are constants, the number of stars in a distance interval `Δd` is proportional to `d² * Δd`.\n\n4.  **Converting from Distance to Parallax:** To find how the number of stars relates to parallax, we need to express both `d` and `Δd` in terms of `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the small interval in distance (`Δd`) and the corresponding small interval in parallax (`Δplx`), we can differentiate the distance formula with respect to parallax:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   For small intervals, we can approximate the relationship as:\n        `Δd ≈ | -1/plx² | * Δplx = (1/plx²) * Δplx`\n\n5.  **Number of Stars in a Given Parallax Range:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `Δd` in terms of `plx` back into our proportionality for the number of stars:\n    `N(plx) ∝ (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) * Δplx )`\n    `N(plx) ∝ (1/plx⁴) * Δplx`\n\n6.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*, which is `N(plx) / Δplx`. Based on the relationship derived above:\n    `N(plx) / Δplx ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
