    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, a two-step process is required: first, ascertain if the star is visible from the Paranal Observatory, and second, determine if it is bright enough to meet the specified signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nA star is considered detectable if it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure using a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT) unit. According to performance specifications for ESPRESSO, this S/N level can be reached for stars with an apparent visual magnitude (V) as faint as 17.1 in a one-hour observation (three 20-minute exposures) in 1-UT (single telescope) mode. Therefore, any star brighter than V = 17.1 mag (i.e., having a magnitude value less than 17.1) is considered detectable.\n\nThe visibility of a star from the Paranal Observatory in Chile depends on its declination. The observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere, making stars in the southern celestial sky easily observable. Stars with very high positive declinations (far northern stars) will not rise above the horizon.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52°. As a southern star, it is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent visual magnitude is -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since -0.74 is much less than the 17.1 magnitude limit, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89°. Due to its extreme northern position, it is not visible from the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is approximately +1.98.\n*   **Conclusion:** As it is not visible from the observatory's location, Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance**\n*   **Observability:** With a declination of 0°, this star lies on the celestial equator and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula: m = M - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(d).\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = 15.0\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the 17.1 limit, so this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance**\n*   **Observability:** Its declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Brightness:** Using the same formula:\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(200) ≈ 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.505 = 21.5\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the 17.1 limit, making this star **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance**\n*   **Observability:** Its declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Brightness:**\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(5) ≈ 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.495 = 13.5\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the 17.1 limit, so this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance**\n*   **Observability:** Its declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Brightness:**\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(50) ≈ 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.495 = 18.5\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the 17.1 limit, making this star **not detectable**.\n\nIn total, three of the listed stars would be detectable: Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc.\n\n<<<C>>>"
