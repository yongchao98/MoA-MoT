    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nThe directing effect of a substituent determines the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will attach.\n\nFirst, we can categorize the substituents into two groups:\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they will produce very low yields of the para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in significant yields of the para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n    *   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** Activating.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating overall, but ortho, para-directing.\n\n**Step 1: Ordering the meta-directors (lowest para-yield)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The stronger the deactivating effect of the group, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer. The order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for nitrobenzene, followed by benzoic acid, and then ethyl benzoate. This gives us the beginning of our sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 2: Ordering the ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directing groups, the ratio of the para to ortho isomer is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\n*   **-CH3 vs. -C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions in ethylbenzene favors the formation of the para-isomer more than in toluene. Thus, the para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-isomer of 1) < Yield(para-isomer of 5)\n\n*   **-Cl vs. alkyl groups:** The chloro group is also ortho, para-directing. Due to a combination of its size and electronic effects, it strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer, often yielding a very high para-to-ortho ratio in bromination reactions. The bromination of chlorobenzene typically yields about 88-89% of the para-isomer, which is generally higher than for toluene (~66%) and ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among these three is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 3: Combining the sequences**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
