    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the mean lifetime (τ) of the particle.**\n    The mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width Γ. The relationship is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s.\n\n    Given:\n    Γₓ = 320 MeV\n\n    Calculation:\n    τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\n    τ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor γ is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m).\n\n    Given:\n    Eₓ = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n    mₓ = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n\n    Calculation:\n    γ = Eₓ / mₓ = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV\n    γ = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\n3.  **Calculate the particle's velocity (β).**\n    The velocity β (in units of the speed of light, c) is related to the Lorentz factor by the formula γ = 1 / √(1 - β²). We can rearrange this to solve for β: β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n\n    Calculation:\n    β = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400)\n    β ≈ 0.9887\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n    The mean decay distance in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels at its velocity (βc) during its dilated lifetime (γτ). The formula is L = γ * β * c * τ.\n\n    Calculation:\n    L ≈ (20/3) * 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    L ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
