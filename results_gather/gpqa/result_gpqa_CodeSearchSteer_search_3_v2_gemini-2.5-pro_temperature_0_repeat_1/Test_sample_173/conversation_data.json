    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass: M\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   The nucleus splits into *only* these two fragments.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-masses of the fragments\n\nWe are given two conditions for the fragment masses:\n1.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass:\n    m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n2.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other:\n    m₁ = 2 * m₂\n\nNow, substitute the second equation into the first:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nUsing this, we can find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nSo, the more massive fragment has a rest-mass of m₁ = 0.66 * M.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy = M * c² = 300 GeV\n*   Final rest-mass energy = (m₁ + m₂) * c² = (0.99 * M) * c² = 0.99 * (M * c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n\nThe Q-value is:\nQ = Initial Energy - Final Energy = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum (p).\n\n*   p₁ = m₁ * v₁\n*   p₂ = m₂ * v₂\n*   p₁ = p₂ = p\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2 * m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2 * m₂)\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2 * m₁)) / (p² / (2 * m₂)) = m₂ / m₁\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, the ratio is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / (2 * m₂) = 1/2  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T₁\n\nIn special relativity, momentum conservation (p₁ = p₂) still holds. The relationship between energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n\nThis can be rearranged to find the momentum:\n(p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)²\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: E = T + m*c².\n(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)\n\nWe apply this to both fragments:\n*   (p₁*c)² = T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (m₁*c²)\n*   (p₂*c)² = T₂² + 2 * T₂ * (m₂*c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   m₁*c² = 0.66 * M*c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n*   m₂*c² = 0.33 * M*c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)². We also know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁.\nT₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = T₁² - 204*T₁ + 603\n\nNow, we solve for T₁:\n396*T₁ = -204*T₁ + 603\n600*T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert this to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
