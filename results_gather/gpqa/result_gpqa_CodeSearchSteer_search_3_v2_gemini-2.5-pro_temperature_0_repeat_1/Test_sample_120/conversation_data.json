    "The analysis of the reaction is based on well-established principles of organic chemistry, which have been confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction Type**: The reaction involves an organocuprate (a Gilman reagent) and an epoxide. Organocuprates are known to perform regioselective epoxide ring-opening reactions.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The prompt states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is a known characteristic of strong nucleophiles, like organocuprates, reacting with epoxides in an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it more sterically hindered than C6. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The prompt also specifies that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, where the nucleophile performs a backside attack. The starting material has an 'S' configuration at C6. The attack by the methyl group will invert this center to an 'R' configuration.\n\n4.  **Product Structure Determination**:\n    *   **Attack**: The methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n    *   **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks, and the oxygen, now bonded to C1, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after an acidic workup.\n    *   **Substituents**: The product will be a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and the new one at C6.\n    *   **IUPAC Naming**: To name the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1) is designated as C1. The ring is numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which is now C2) gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5} for the four methyl groups. This is lower than the alternative numbering ({1, 3, 4, 6}). Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which eliminates options C and D.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of the Product**:\n    *   The configurations of the chiral centers not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) remain unchanged.\n    *   **New C1 (Original C1)**: Retains its **R** configuration.\n    *   **New C2 (Original C6)**: Inverts from **S** to **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Original C4)**: Retains its **R** configuration.\n    *   **New C5 (Original C3)**: Retains its **R** configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the final product has the stereochemistry (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nCombining the name and stereochemistry, the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
