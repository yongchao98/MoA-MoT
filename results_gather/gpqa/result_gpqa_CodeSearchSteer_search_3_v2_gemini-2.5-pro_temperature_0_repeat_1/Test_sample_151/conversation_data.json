    "When a yeast cell forms a shmoo, it is responding to a mating pheromone. This process involves several key cellular events:\n1.  **Cell Cycle Arrest:** The cell arrests in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This is crucial because the cell is preparing to fuse with a mating partner, not to divide and replicate its own DNA.\n2.  **Transcriptional Reprogramming:** The pheromone signal activates a pathway that leads to large-scale changes in gene expression. Genes required for mating, cell fusion, and polarized growth are strongly transcribed.\n3.  **Active Chromatin:** The regions of the genome containing these actively transcribed genes are in a state of \"active chromatin\" (euchromatin), which is accessible to the transcriptional machinery. A proteomic analysis of this active chromatin would recover the proteins bound to these regions.\n\nLet's evaluate the protein complexes in this context:\n\n*   **A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This complex, which includes RNA polymerase II, is essential for starting transcription. Given the high level of transcription of mating-specific genes during shmoo formation, PICs would be abundant on active chromatin.\n*   **B) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of all chromatin. Any analysis of chromatin, active or inactive, will recover a large number of histone proteins.\n*   **D) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers bind specific transcription factors that dramatically increase the rate of transcription of target genes. The pheromone response is mediated by such transcription factors binding to enhancers to activate the necessary genes for mating. Therefore, these complexes would be highly prevalent on active chromatin.\n*   **C) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** This complex assembles on origins of replication during the G1 phase, licensing the DNA for a future round of replication. However, the pheromone-induced G1 arrest *prevents* the cell from entering the S phase, where DNA replication would occur. While the pre-RC is assembled on the chromatin, the process it enables (DNA replication) is actively inhibited. Compared to the massive transcriptional activity that defines the shmoo state, the machinery for the blocked replication process would be significantly less represented in the proteome of *active* chromatin.\n\nTherefore, the pre-replication complex would be the least observed complex associated with the primary activity occurring on the chromatin.\n\n<<<C>>>"
