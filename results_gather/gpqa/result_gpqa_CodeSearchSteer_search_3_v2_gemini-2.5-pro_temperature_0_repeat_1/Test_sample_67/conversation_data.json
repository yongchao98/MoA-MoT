    "The problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, Sz.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the initial state of the particle is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian of the system is given by H = -**μ** · **B**, where **μ** is the magnetic moment operator and **B** is the magnetic field vector. Since **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator, the new Hamiltonian is H = -γB*Sy.\n\nDue to the torque exerted by the new magnetic field, the spin of the particle will precess around the direction of this new field, which is the Y-axis. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, known as the Larmor frequency, is given by ω = γB.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <Sz>, which is proportional to the z-component of the magnetic moment, will oscillate as the spin precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency.\n\nTo confirm this, we can look at the time evolution of the expectation value of the spin operators using the Heisenberg equation of motion: d<**S**>/dt = (1/iħ)<[**S**, H]>.\n\nFor the z-component:\nd<Sz>/dt = (1/iħ)<[Sz, -γB*Sy]> = (-γB/iħ)<[Sz, Sy]>\nUsing the commutation relation [Sz, Sy] = iħSx, we get:\nd<Sz>/dt = (-γB/iħ)(iħSx) = -γB<Sx>\n\nFor the x-component:\nd<Sx>/dt = (1/iħ)<[Sx, -γB*Sy]> = (-γB/iħ)<[Sx, Sy]>\nUsing the commutation relation [Sx, Sy] = iħSz, we get:\nd<Sx>/dt = (-γB/iħ)(iħSz) = -γB<Sz>\n\nNow we have a system of coupled differential equations. Differentiating the first equation with respect to time gives:\nd²<Sz>/dt² = -γB(d<Sx>/dt)\nSubstituting the second equation into this yields:\nd²<Sz>/dt² = -γB(-γB<Sz>) = (γB)²<Sz>\n\nThis is the differential equation for simple harmonic motion, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency of oscillation ω is γB.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>"
