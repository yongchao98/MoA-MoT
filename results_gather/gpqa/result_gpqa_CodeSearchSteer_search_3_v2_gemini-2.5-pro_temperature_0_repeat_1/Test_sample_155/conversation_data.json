    "The analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting product mixture is confirmed by the search results.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n    *   The first step is the epoxidation of a trans-alkene. This is a syn-addition, which results in a trans-epoxide. For the symmetrical (E)-oct-4-ene, this produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step is the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water. This is an anti-addition. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, and water attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the back side. This anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene results in a meso compound. Specifically, opening either the (4R,5R)- or the (4S,5S)-epoxide via an anti-attack by water yields the same achiral product: meso-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n    *   The first step is the epoxidation of a cis-alkene. This syn-addition results in a cis-epoxide. For the symmetrical (Z)-oct-4-ene, this produces the achiral meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step is the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide. This anti-addition proceeds with equal likelihood of attack at either of the two epoxide carbons. Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. The result is a racemic mixture of these two enantiomers.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own distinct peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
