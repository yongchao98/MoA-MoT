    "The reaction sequence and the final product have been correctly identified. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction and the determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\n    This reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide**\n    When an α-halo ketone is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then rearranges to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after acidic workup, which is implicit). Therefore, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n    This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) reacts with the carboxylic acid to form cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride, with pyridine acting as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol. Thus, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached. A plane of symmetry passes through the aldehyde group and the carbon atom it is attached to (C1), bisecting the ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen on the carbon atom attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). One hydrogen is *cis* (on the same side) to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans* (on the opposite side). The two *cis* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* hydrogens are equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This results in two more distinct sets of equivalent hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nSumming these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
