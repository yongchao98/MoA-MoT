    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the permitted and non-permitted partial waves based on the provided conservation laws and principles.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a **`1S0`** state.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1`  => Total Spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   `J = 0` => Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`\n*   **Parity:** The parity of the NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   `P(NN_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, which implies that the quantity `L + S + T` must be an odd number.\n    *   For the initial state, `0 + 0 + T(NN_initial)` must be odd, which means the isospin `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\n### 2. Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f, ...` corresponding to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n*   **Final NN State:** Has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0` as given in the problem.\n\nWe must apply three main rules:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_initial = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_final`) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming particle X has no spin). For the total to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n    **`J(NN_final) = l_X`**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state (`+1`) must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`\n    *   `+1 = ((-1)^L(NN_final)) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X + 1)`\n    *   This requires the exponent to be even, meaning: **`L(NN_final) + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN_final) = 0`, we have:\n    *   `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    *   This requires `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1` to be an even number, which means: **`S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be odd.**\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). (Satisfied)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). (**Violated**)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): This state would have `2S+1=7`, meaning `S=3`. A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. Therefore, the `7D1` state is not a possible state for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because the final NN state is physically impossible.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and D represent transitions that are not permitted. However, they are forbidden for different reasons:\n*   **Option D** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Option B** describes a transition to a valid state (`3P0`) that is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle for a `T=0` isospin state, a rule explicitly mentioned in the problem.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the conservation laws and the given Pauli statistics rule. Option B is the only one that is forbidden specifically by the Pauli principle as formulated in the problem, while satisfying the conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
