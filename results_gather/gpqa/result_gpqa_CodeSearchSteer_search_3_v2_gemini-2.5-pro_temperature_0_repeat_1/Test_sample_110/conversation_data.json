    "### Analysis of Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a classic Michael addition.\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the starting ketone to form an enolate. The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon, meaning it is bonded to four other carbon atoms (the carbonyl carbon, a methyl group, an ethyl group, and C3 of the ring). It has no hydrogen atoms to be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and two other ring carbons. It has one alpha-hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate can only form at the C6 position.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The resulting enolate anion at C6 acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n3.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety. After workup, this yields a single constitutional isomer.\n4.  **Product Naming:** The resulting molecule is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the third carbon of the propanoate chain. When naming the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, the numbering starts from the point of attachment (C1'). This leads to the name **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. The names provided in options C and D describe a different constitutional isomer that would not be formed from the given starting materials.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane. The protons on this carbon are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, leading to the formation of a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n3.  **Product Structure:** The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond. Subsequent protonation by water (H₂O) yields the final product.\n4.  **Product Naming:** To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN) is identified. This chain is six carbons long, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**. The carbons are numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1. This places a methyl group at C3 and the nitro group at C4. The correct IUPAC name is therefore **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. The name given in options A and C, 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, corresponds to a molecule with a different carbon skeleton and an incorrect molecular formula based on the reactants.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
