    "The final product is identified by following a three-step reaction sequence starting from a compound identified by its molecular formula and NMR data.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the 1H-NMR data provides the following clues:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring is indicated by the two doublets in the aromatic region at 6.98 ppm (2H) and 6.51 ppm (2H).\n*   An aldehyde group (-CHO) is suggested by the triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H).\n*   A -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde is indicated by the doublet at 3.66 ppm (2H). The coupling between this group and the aldehyde proton explains the observed splitting patterns (doublet and triplet).\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2) is suggested by the broad singlet at 6.27 ppm (2H).\n\nAssembling these fragments, the starting compound is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-), forming 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n2.  **H2O:** The addition of water hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This step yields **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which has α-hydrogens, will react with itself. The reaction first proceeds through an aldol addition to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. However, the presence of heat promotes a subsequent dehydration (loss of water) to yield a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe self-aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde proceeds as follows:\n*   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule forms an enolate which then attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule, leading to the intermediate product, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** Due to the applied heat, this intermediate readily loses a molecule of water. This elimination forms a double bond in conjugation with the carbonyl group, resulting in the final product, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is more stable due to its extended conjugated system.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
