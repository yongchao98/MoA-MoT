    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the uncertainty in the electron's momentum (Δp):**\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nGiven that the uncertainty in the electron's location is Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in its momentum:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx) = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s.\n\n**2. Relate the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in momentum:**\n\nThe kinetic energy (E) of the electron is related to its momentum (p) by the formula:\n\nE = p² / (2m)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the electron, approximately 9.11 x 10⁻³¹ kg.\n\nTo find the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) resulting from the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), we can differentiate the energy equation with respect to momentum:\n\ndE/dp = 2p / (2m) = p/m\n\nSince momentum p = mv, where v is the velocity, we have:\n\ndE/dp = mv / m = v\n\nFor small uncertainties, we can approximate the relationship as:\n\nΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp = v * Δp\n\n**3. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):**\n\nUsing the given velocity v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s and the calculated uncertainty in momentum Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s, we can estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy:\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>"
