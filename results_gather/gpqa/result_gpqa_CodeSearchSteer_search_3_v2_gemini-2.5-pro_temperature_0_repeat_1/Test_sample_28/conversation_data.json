    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be inactivated. This is most effectively achieved by a \"knockout\" mutation that completely destroys the function of the protein product. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The process of protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon and proceeds by reading three-base codons until a stop codon is reached.\n\n**Intact Gene Analysis:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...TGA-3’\n*   **Codons and Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine\n    *   ...and so on, until the `TGA` (Stop) codon.\nThis sequence produces a full-length, functional protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Analysis of the Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The codon `TTT` (Phenylalanine) changes to `TTC` (Phenylalanine). This is a silent mutation with no change in the amino acid.\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The codon `TTT` (Phenylalanine) changes to `TTC` (Phenylalanine) - a silent mutation.\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAA`. According to the genetic code, `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes the ribosome to halt protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and certainly non-functional. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   This mutant has two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, these amino acid changes might affect the protein, but a complete loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   This mutant also contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and `GGT` (Glycine) to `ACT` (Threonine). Again, this is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene's coding sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein, which is the most probable way to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
