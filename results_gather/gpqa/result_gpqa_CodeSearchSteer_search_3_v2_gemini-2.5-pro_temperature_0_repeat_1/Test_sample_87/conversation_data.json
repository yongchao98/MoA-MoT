    "The scenario describes an immune response initiated in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) after oral administration of a viral protein. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the events:\n\n1.  **Antigen Presentation:** The rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, mimicking a natural infection. They are taken up in the small intestine by specialized secondary lymphoid organs called Peyer's patches. Within the Peyer's patches, antigens are presented to lymphocytes, initiating an adaptive immune response.\n2.  **B Cell Activation and Proliferation:** B cells that recognize the rotavirus protein become activated. These activated B cells move into specialized microstructures within the Peyer's patches called germinal centers, where they begin to proliferate rapidly. This corresponds to the \"proliferating cell population\" isolated in the experiment.\n3.  **Generation of Variability:** The key finding is \"high variability\" in the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating B cells. This points directly to a specific process that diversifies the antigen-binding region of antibodies *after* an initial antigen encounter.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial B cell receptor diversity by combining Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) gene segments. However, this occurs in the bone marrow during the development of naive B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. It is not the source of variability in B cells that are already activated and proliferating in a Peyer's patch.\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that introduces point mutations at a very high rate into the rearranged variable region genes of activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers. This process is responsible for generating variants of the original antibody, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. The high level of mutation in the variable region is the defining characteristic of SHM. This perfectly matches the experimental observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain of proliferating cells in Peyer's patches.\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that can be activated by antibodies or pathogens to help eliminate infections. It is a component of the humoral immune response but does not involve any genetic changes in B cells.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switches the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in mucosal responses) and alters its function, but it does not change the antigen-binding specificity or create the variability observed in the variable region.\n\nTherefore, the process responsible for the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
