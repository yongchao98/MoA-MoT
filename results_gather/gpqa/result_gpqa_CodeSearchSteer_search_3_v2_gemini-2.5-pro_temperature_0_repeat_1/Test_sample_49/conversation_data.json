    "The key to determining the number of loops in the Feynman diagram lies in the `1/(4pi)^6` factor present in the scribbled expression.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations, particularly when using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a factor of `1/(4pi)^2` into the final expression. This arises from the integration over the loop momentum.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The overall factor from these loop integrations will be `(1/(4pi)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4pi)^(2L)`.\n\nIn the note found, the expression contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this with the general formula, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops. The other factors in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`) and the ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`), relate to the number and types of vertices and the specific process being calculated, but the `1/(4pi)^6` term is the most direct indicator of the loop order.\n\n<<<B>>>"
