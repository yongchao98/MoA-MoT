    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n    *   The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents.\n    *   FTIR data indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen, X, is directly attached to the benzene ring).\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Structures:**\n    *   One substituent is the halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Possibility 1 (Ketone):** An acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃. This fits the C2 and C=O requirement. The resulting molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The chemical formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbons, which is correct.\n    *   **Possibility 2 (Aldehyde):** A formyl-methyl group, -CH₂CHO. This also fits the C2 and C=O requirement. The resulting molecule is a **halophenylacetaldehyde**. The chemical formula is X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (side chain) = 8 carbons, which is also correct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Options:**\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum should account for all the protons in the molecule. For a di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄), there are 4 aromatic protons. The number of aliphatic protons depends on the substituent.\n    *   **Option A:** `4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`. This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n    *   **Option B:** `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`.\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n        *   The signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This pattern is typical for a para (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n        *   The signal at 3.7 ppm (2H, s) would correspond to the methylene (-CH₂) group.\n        *   This data is consistent with the structure of **4-halophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Option C:** `6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`. The integration (total 7H) and splitting pattern do not clearly match a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`.\n        *   The signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are two doublets for 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring, identical to option B.\n        *   The signal at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) is a singlet, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group).\n        *   This data is consistent with the structure of **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n4.  **Compare Plausible Options (B and D):**\n    *   Both 4-haloacetophenone (fits D) and 4-halophenylacetaldehyde (fits B) are valid structures based on the initial information.\n    *   We must look closer at the chemical shifts. The aromatic protons in both options are given as 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. These are significantly downfield, indicating they are attached to a ring with electron-withdrawing substituents.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH₃) in acetophenone is a strong electron-withdrawing group due to direct conjugation of the carbonyl with the ring. This effect strongly deshields the aromatic protons, especially those ortho to the group.\n    *   The -CH₂CHO group in phenylacetaldehyde is less electron-withdrawing because the insulating -CH₂- group prevents direct resonance of the carbonyl with the ring.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic protons of a haloacetophenone are expected to be at a lower field (higher ppm) than those of a halophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Literature data for 4-chloroacetophenone shows aromatic signals around 7.9 and 7.4 ppm and a methyl singlet around 2.6 ppm. The values in option D (7.8, 7.6, and 2.3 ppm) are very reasonable for a 4-haloacetophenone.\n    *   Literature data for similar aldehydes show the aromatic protons at a higher field (lower ppm) than in the corresponding acetophenones. For example, the aromatic protons of 4-fluorobenzaldehyde are at 7.9 and 7.2 ppm.\n    *   The fact that option B presents strongly deshielded aromatic protons (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) combined with aldehyde/methylene signals is chemically less consistent than the combination in option D. The strong deshielding is more characteristic of the acetyl group's direct attachment to the ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The ¹H NMR data in option D provides the most self-consistent picture. The chemical shifts for the aromatic protons (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are appropriate for a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and a strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group. The chemical shift for the methyl singlet (2.3 ppm) is also characteristic of an acetyl group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
