    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The relationship is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find how many times greater the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) is compared to Star_2 (L₂), we can set up a ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    By canceling out the constants (4, π, and σ), the formula simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ is 1.5. Squaring this value gives:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law. This law states that the temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its intrinsic peak wavelength, λ_rest). The formula is T = b / λ_rest, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁.\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect on Wavelength**: The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. However, Star_2 is moving away from the observers at 700 km/s, which causes its light to be redshifted due to the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the intrinsic rest wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c) for velocities much less than the speed of light (c).\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed wavelength is equal to its rest wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, with a velocity v₂ = 700 km/s, its observed wavelength is λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio**: Since the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can say:\n    λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    From this, we find the ratio of the rest wavelengths:\n    λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n    Because T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Now we substitute all the values back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009358\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is closest to 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
