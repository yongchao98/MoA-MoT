    "To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be systematically analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons are those directly attached to the carbons of an alkene.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment. It can also correspond to other fragments like [CH₂CH₂OH]⁺, but given the strong FTIR evidence for a carboxylic acid, the [COOH]⁺ assignment is most likely.\n\n### Evaluating the Molecular Formulas\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This requires the presence of two oxygen atoms and at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for a molecular formula can be calculated to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds. The formula is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; other atoms like oxygen do not affect this calculation).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    *   Contains only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is not enough to accommodate both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    *   Contains only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the degree of unsaturation is correct, the number of oxygen atoms is not.\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Contains two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This can accommodate one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data, suggesting a structure like a hexenoic acid.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Contains two oxygens, which could form a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Degree of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is not enough to accommodate both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
