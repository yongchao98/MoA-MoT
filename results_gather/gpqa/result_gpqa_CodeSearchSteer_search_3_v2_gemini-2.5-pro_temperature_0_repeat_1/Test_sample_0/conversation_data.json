    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than the inherent energy uncertainty, or \"linewidth,\" of each level. This energy uncertainty (ΔE) is fundamentally linked to the lifetime (Δt) of the state by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which can be expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A shorter lifetime leads to a greater uncertainty in energy.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the energy uncertainty for each quantum state. The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁): Using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, the uncertainty is approximately (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂): The uncertainty is approximately (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation must be greater than the broader of the two linewidths. The first state has a shorter lifetime and therefore a larger energy uncertainty of about 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow, we compare this required energy separation with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is significantly smaller than the uncertainties of both states.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also much smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is substantially larger than the calculated energy uncertainties of both states (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nAn energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is several orders of magnitude greater than the natural linewidths of the states, which would allow them to be easily and clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<D>>>"
