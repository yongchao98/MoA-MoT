    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ** (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbons of the double bond are sp2 hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule is planar with respect to the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  ** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with defined configurations (R and S) at its chiral centers. The presence of these stereochemical descriptors indicates that the molecule is chiral. As a specific enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n\n3.  ** (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry between these two carbons, where one half is the mirror image of the other. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\n4.  ** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R,3R) configuration is diastereomeric to the meso form. This isomer is chiral and its mirror image, the (2S,3S) isomer, is non-superimposable. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. The molecule is designated as a single enantiomer, which means it is chiral and will be optically active.\n\n6.  ** (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound is also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. The three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposing CH2 group on the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n7.  ** 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not contain any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are bonded to two hydrogens (or two other carbons in the ring), and the isobutyl group also lacks a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n<<<B>>>"
