    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, ∇⋅f, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field f(r) is directed radially outward and its magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin, given by f(r) = 1/r².\n\nThis can be expressed in vector form as **f** = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a closed volume to the surface integral of the field over the boundary of that volume. The theorem is stated as:\n\n∫∫∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∬ (**f** ⋅ **n̂**) dS\n\nwhere:\n*   V is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   S is the surface of the sphere.\n*   **n̂** is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface. For a sphere, **n̂** is the same as the radial unit vector **r̂**.\n*   dS is the differential surface area element.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates for r > 0 gives zero. However, the vector field is undefined at the origin (r=0), creating a singularity. The Divergence Theorem is strictly applicable only to vector fields that are continuously differentiable throughout the volume.\n\nTo handle the singularity at the origin, we apply the Divergence Theorem to the surface of the sphere, which encloses the singularity. By doing this, we evaluate the total flux of the vector field out of the sphere.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1.  Set up the surface integral from the Divergence Theorem.\n2.  On the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R.\n3.  The vector field **f** on the surface is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n4.  The outward unit normal **n̂** is **r̂**.\n5.  The dot product **f** ⋅ **n̂** becomes ((1/R²) **r̂**) ⋅ **r̂** = 1/R², since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1.\n6.  The integral becomes ∬ (1/R²) dS.\n7.  Since 1/R² is a constant over the surface, we can take it out of the integral: (1/R²) ∬ dS.\n8.  The integral ∬ dS is simply the total surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR².\n9.  Multiplying the constant by the surface area gives (1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π.\n\nThe entire contribution to the integral comes from the singularity at the origin, which acts as a \"source\". The flux through any sphere centered at the origin is the same, regardless of the radius R. Therefore, the value of the volume integral of the divergence is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
