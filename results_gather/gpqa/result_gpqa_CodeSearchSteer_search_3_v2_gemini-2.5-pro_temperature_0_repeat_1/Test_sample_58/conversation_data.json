    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species and then determine which species is in excess after neutralization reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles**\n*   **CH3COOH (Weak Acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n*   **HCl (Strong Acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (Strong Base):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\n**2. Neutralization Reactions**\nThe neutralization process occurs in steps, with the strong acid and strong base reacting first.\n\n*   **Step A: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions will react with OH⁻ ions in a 1:1 ratio: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n    *   Since there are fewer moles of H⁺, it is the limiting reactant.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n*   **Step B: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    *   Now, the remaining 0.100 moles of strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O.\n    *   The weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant in this step.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n**3. Calculate Final pH**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions from the strong base. The presence of a strong base will dictate the pH of the solution, as its contribution to the hydroxide concentration is far more significant than any contribution from the weak conjugate base (CH3COO⁻) formed.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the Solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
