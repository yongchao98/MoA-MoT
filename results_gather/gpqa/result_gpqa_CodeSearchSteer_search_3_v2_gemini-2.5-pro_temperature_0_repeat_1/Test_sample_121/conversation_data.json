    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    This reaction is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is converted to bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH). Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion from ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    This is a classic cyclization reaction similar to a malonic ester synthesis.\n    *   **Step 4a:** Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, forming an enolate.\n    *   **Step 4b:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion and forming an intermediate.\n    *   **Step 4c:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining α-proton is also removed, forming a new enolate.\n    *   **Step 4d:** This enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Final Product 4**\n\nThe structure of product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CN\n      |\nC1 --(CH2) -- C2\n|  \\  /  |\nCOOCH₂CH₃ C6--C5--C4\n```\n\nThe central carbon of the cyclohexane ring (C1) is attached to four different groups (-CN, -COOCH₂CH₃, the C2 side of the ring, and the C6 side of the ring), making it a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton signals based on this structure, applying common interpretations for NMR spectra:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are adjacent to a chiral center (C1), making them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, in practice, the chemical shift difference for diastereotopic protons on a flexible acyclic chain can be very small, and they are often treated as a single signal (a quartet in this case). We will follow this common simplification. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral, none of the carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are equivalent to each other. For example, C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n    *   Furthermore, the two protons on any given carbon of the ring (geminal protons) are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent.\n    *   A rigorous count would yield 10 distinct signals for the 10 protons on the ring. However, in multiple-choice questions of this type, we often need to consider plausible simplifications or approximations.\n    *   A common approximation is to consider the effect of the chiral center diminishing with distance.\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These carbons are directly attached to the chiral center C1. Their electronic environments are clearly different. The two geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic and give **2 signals**. The two geminal protons on C6 are also diastereotopic and inequivalent to the C2 protons, giving another **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** These carbons are further from the chiral center. It is a reasonable approximation to consider their environments as equivalent (i.e., the difference is negligible). The four protons on C3 and C5 would therefore be grouped. Within this group, the \"axial\" protons are equivalent to each other, and the \"equatorial\" protons are equivalent to each other, but the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals** for the C3/C5 set.\n        *   **C4:** This carbon is the furthest from C1. The two geminal protons on C4 are diastereotopic and will give **2 signals**.\n\n    *   **Total Ring Signals:** 2 (from C2) + 2 (from C6) + 2 (from C3/C5 pair) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\n### **Total Number of Signals**\n\nAdding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH₃) + 1 (for -CH₂-) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 8 signals\n\nTotal distinct signals = 2 + 8 = **10 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
