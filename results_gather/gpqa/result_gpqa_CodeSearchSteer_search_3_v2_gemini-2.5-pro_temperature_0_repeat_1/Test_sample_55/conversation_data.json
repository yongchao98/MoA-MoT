    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules. For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n\n1.  **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (l):**  Δl = ±1.\n2.  **Change in magnetic quantum number (m):** Δm = 0, ±1.\n3.  **Change in principal quantum number (n):** There is no specific rule for Δn, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the final n must be smaller than the initial n.\n\nLet's analyze the two-step transition from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩**\n\n*   **Initial state:** n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   Δl = l' - 0 = ±1  ⇒  l' = 1.\n    *   Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1  ⇒  m' = 0, 1, or -1.\n    *   n' must be less than 3. For a two-step decay to n=1, the intermediate state will have n'=2.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Second transition: Intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final state:** n=1, l=0, m=0.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   From |2,1,0⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed).\n    *   From |2,1,1⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed).\n    *   From |2,1,-1⟩: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed), and Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed).\n\nAll three pathways are permitted by the selection rules. The options provided in the question list valid decay routes.\n\n**Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0). In the absence of any external polarizing field, the decay to each of the possible `m'` states of the intermediate |2,1,m'⟩ level is equally probable. Since there are three possible intermediate states (m' = -1, 0, 1), the probability of the atom decaying through any single one of these channels is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes are:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - Correct route and probability.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<C>>>"
