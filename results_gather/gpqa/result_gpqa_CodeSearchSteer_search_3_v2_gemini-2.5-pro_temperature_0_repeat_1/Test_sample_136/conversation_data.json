    "To determine the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to calculate the energy gained per revolution and divide the final kinetic energy by this value.\n\n1.  **Energy Gain per Acceleration:**\n    A proton is accelerated each time it crosses the gap between the dees of the synchrocyclotron. The energy gained in a single pass is determined by the voltage at that instant and the charge of the proton. The voltage is given by `U(t) = U₀ cos(2πνt + Φ₀)`.\n    The problem states an initial phase of `Φ₀ = π/4`. This is the synchronous phase (`Φ_s`) at which the proton is designed to cross the accelerating gap to maintain stability in its orbit.\n    The energy gained in one acceleration is:\n    `ΔT_pass = e * U₀ * cos(Φ_s)`\n    where:\n    *   `e` is the elementary charge of the proton.\n    *   `U₀` is the peak voltage, given as 190 kV.\n    *   `Φ_s` is the synchronous phase, given as π/4.\n\n2.  **Energy Gain per Revolution:**\n    In a standard cyclotron or synchrocyclotron, the particle is accelerated twice per revolution. Therefore, the total energy gained in one full revolution is:\n    `ΔT_rev = 2 * ΔT_pass = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φ_s)`\n\n3.  **Calculation of Energy Gain per Revolution:**\n    First, let's express the peak voltage in mega-volts (MV) to get the energy gain in mega-electron-volts (MeV).\n    *   `U₀ = 190 kV = 0.190 MV`\n    The energy gain for a proton (charge `e`) passing through a potential of 0.190 MV is `e * U₀ = 0.190 MeV`.\n    Now, we can calculate the energy gain per revolution:\n    *   `cos(π/4) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071`\n    *   `ΔT_rev = 2 * (0.190 MeV) * cos(π/4)`\n    *   `ΔT_rev = 0.380 MeV * (1/√2) ≈ 0.2687 MeV`\n\n4.  **Total Number of Revolutions:**\n    The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and reaches a final kinetic energy `T_f = 950 MeV`. The total number of revolutions (`N`) can be found by dividing the total energy gained by the energy gained per revolution.\n    `N = T_f / ΔT_rev`\n    `N = 950 MeV / (0.380 MeV / √2)`\n    `N = (950 * √2) / 0.380`\n    `N ≈ (950 * 1.4142) / 0.380`\n    `N ≈ 1343.5 / 0.380`\n    `N ≈ 3535.5`\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the proton makes approximately 3536 revolutions.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1864\nB) 2500\nC) 5300\nD) 3536\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
