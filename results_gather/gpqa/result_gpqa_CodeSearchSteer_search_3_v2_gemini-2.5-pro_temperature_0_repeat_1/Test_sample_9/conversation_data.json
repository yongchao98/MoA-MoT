    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, a comparison of the four options is necessary, considering the principles of planetary density.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** By definition, this planet would have the same average density as Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density of this planet is explicitly stated as being very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, the density increases with mass. This is due to the greater gravitational force of a more massive planet, which compresses its material more tightly. Therefore, a planet that is five times more massive than Earth but has the same composition will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will have weaker gravity and therefore less compression. This results in a lower density compared to a more massive planet of the same composition. Consequently, this planet would be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four scenarios, the planet in option (c) will have the highest density. The planet in (a) has Earth's density, and the planet in (b) has a very similar density. The planet in (d) would be less dense than Earth. The planet in (c), being five times more massive, would experience the most significant gravitational compression, leading to the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
