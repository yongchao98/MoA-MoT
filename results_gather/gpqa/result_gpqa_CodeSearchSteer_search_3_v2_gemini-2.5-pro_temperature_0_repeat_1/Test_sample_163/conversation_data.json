    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M₁ + M₂) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe fact that both systems exhibit eclipses is crucial. It implies that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. In this case, the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°, and sin(*i*) ≈ 1. This simplifies the calculations, as the measured maximum radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) can be taken as the actual orbital speeds (v₁ and v₂).\n\n### 2. The Formula for Total Mass\nThe relationship between total mass, period, and velocity in a binary system is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a circular orbit, the total mass (M_total) is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (v₁ + v₂)³\n\nSince the systems are eclipsing, we can approximate the orbital velocities v₁ and v₂ with their observed radial velocity amplitudes K₁ and K₂. The term (2πG) is a constant. Therefore, the total mass is directly proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### 3. Calculate for Each System\nWe can use this proportionality to find the ratio of the masses of the two systems.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n### 4. Determine the Ratio\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is the ratio of their total masses (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\nMass Ratio = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\n\nNow, we plug in the values. Note that since we are calculating a ratio, the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) will cancel out, so no conversion is necessary.\n\nMass Ratio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nMass Ratio = [2 * 3375] / [1 * 15625]\nMass Ratio = 6750 / 15625\nMass Ratio = 0.432\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4. This indicates that system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2, meaning it is less massive.\n\n<<<C>>>"
