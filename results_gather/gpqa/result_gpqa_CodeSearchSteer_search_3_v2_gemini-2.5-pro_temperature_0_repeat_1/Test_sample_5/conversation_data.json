    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass *m* in the given two-dimensional potential, we first express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe use the standard transformations to Cartesian coordinates:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nFrom these, we have r² = x² + y² and x² = r² cos²(θ).\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of two independent potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\nV(x, y) = V(x) + V(y)\nwhere V(x) = 2kx² and V(y) = 1/2 ky².\n\nThese are the potentials for two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators. The Schrödinger equation for this system can be separated, and the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two oscillators.\n\nThe energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 k_z z² is given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k_z / m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the potential is V(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x². The effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is:\nω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy levels for the x-oscillator are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the potential is V(y) = 1/2 ky². The spring constant is k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\nω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy levels for the y-oscillator are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe total energy E of the system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2) * 2ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
