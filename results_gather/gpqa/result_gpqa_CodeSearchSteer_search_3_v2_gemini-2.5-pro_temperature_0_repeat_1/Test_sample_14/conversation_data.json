    "To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to compare their geometric transit probabilities.\n\n### Step 1: The Transit Probability Formula\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star is approximately the ratio of the star's radius (R_star) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a). Since the problem states the planets have circular orbits, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital distance.\n\n*   **P_transit ≈ R_star / a**\n\n### Step 2: Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observable Properties\nTo compare the probabilities, we need to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of the given information: the orbital period (P) and the host star's mass (M_star). We can do this using Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\nKepler's Third Law states:\n*   **P² = (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³**\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant. We can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\n*   a³ = (G * M_star * P²) / 4π²\n*   **a = ( (G * M_star * P²) / 4π² )^(1/3)**\n\n### Step 3: Combining the Formulas\nNow, we substitute the expression for 'a' back into the transit probability formula:\n\n*   P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\nThis combined formula shows how the transit probability depends on the star's radius, the star's mass, and the planet's orbital period.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities\nWe can now calculate the ratio of the transit probability for Planet_1 (P_transit1) to that of Planet_2 (P_transit2).\n\n*   **Ratio = P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [ R_star1 / (M_star1 * P1²)^(1/3) ] / [ R_star2 / (M_star2 * P2²)^(1/3) ]**\n\nLet's use the information provided in the problem:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: **R_star1 = R_star2**\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2: **M_star1 = 2 * M_star2**\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: **P1 = P2 / 3**\n\nSubstituting these relationships into the ratio equation:\n\n*   Ratio = (R_star2 / R_star2) * [ (M_star2 * P2²) / ( (2 * M_star2) * (P2 / 3)² ) ]^(1/3)\n*   Ratio = 1 * [ (M_star2 * P2²) / ( (2 * M_star2) * (P2² / 9) ) ]^(1/3)\n*   Ratio = [ (M_star2 * P2²) / ( (2/9) * M_star2 * P2² ) ]^(1/3)\n\nThe terms for M_star2 and P2² cancel out, simplifying the expression:\n\n*   Ratio = ( 1 / (2/9) )^(1/3)\n*   Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\n*   Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5 gives the final ratio:\n\n*   **Ratio ≈ 1.65**\n\nThis result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting its star is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting its star. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
