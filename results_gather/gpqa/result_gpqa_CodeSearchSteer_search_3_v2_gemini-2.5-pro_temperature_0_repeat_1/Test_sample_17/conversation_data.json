    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the notation**\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, relative to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y)_star - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun`\n\nwhere `n_X` and `n_Y` are the number densities of atoms of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\n**2. Analyze the information for Star 1**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`. There is a useful identity that relates these quantities:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3` dex\n\nThis means:\n\n`log10(n_Si / n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun = 0.3`\n`log10(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n**3. Analyze the information for Star 2**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nSimilarly, we can relate these abundances to find `[Si/H]_2`:\n\n`[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n`0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2`\n\nSolving for `[Si/H]_2`:\n\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3` dex\n\nThis means:\n\n`log10(n_Si / n_H)_2 - log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun = -0.3`\n`log10(n_Si / n_H)_2 = -0.3 + log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n**4. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. This refers to the ratio of their abundances relative to hydrogen, which is the standard measure. We need to calculate:\n\n`Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\nTo find this ratio, we can take the logarithm of the expression:\n\n`log10(Ratio) = log10((n_Si / n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si / n_H)_2)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions we found in steps 2 and 3:\n\n`log10(Ratio) = (0.3 + log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun) - (-0.3 + log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun)`\n\nThe term `log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun` cancels out:\n\n`log10(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nFinally, to find the ratio, we take the antilogarithm:\n\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n`Ratio â‰ˆ 3.98`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information about the stellar masses, the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg, and the method used (LTE, EW) are not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
