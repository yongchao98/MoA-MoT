    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. This scenario is famously demonstrated in the Fizeau experiment, which showed that the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the speed of light in the medium and the medium's velocity.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the variables:\n\n*   **c**: The speed of light in a vacuum, which the problem states is equal to 1.\n*   **n**: The refractive index of the glass. The speed of light within the glass (in the rest frame of the glass) is therefore `u' = c/n = 1/n`.\n*   **v**: The velocity of the glass (the moving frame) as observed from the laboratory.\n*   **u**: The speed of light in the moving glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory (the stationary frame). This is the value we need to find.\n\nThe relativistic formula for adding velocities in the same direction is:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into this formula:\n\n1.  Replace `u'` with `1/n`.\n2.  Replace `c` with `1`.\n\nThe formula becomes:\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
