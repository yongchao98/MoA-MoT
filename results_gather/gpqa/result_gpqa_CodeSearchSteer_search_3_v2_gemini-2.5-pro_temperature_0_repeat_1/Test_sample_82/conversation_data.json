    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.\n*   **Initial volume of acetic acid (V1):** 20.00 cm³ = 0.020 L\n*   **Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1):** 0.05 M\n*   **Volume of water added:** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final volume of diluted acid (V2):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, the new concentration (M2) is:\n    M2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, sodium acetate. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):** 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At this point, a buffer solution exists containing the remaining acetic acid and the newly formed acetate (A⁻).\n*   **Moles of HA remaining:** 75% of initial moles = 0.75 * 0.001 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   **Moles of A⁻ formed:** 25% of initial moles = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n\nWe use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer solution.\n*   **pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])**\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Since both species are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles:\n    pH = 4.73 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    pH = 4.73 + log (1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    **pH ≈ 4.25**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, which will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence:** This equals the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate (A⁻):** Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes water as follows: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. To find the pH, we need the Kb of the acetate ion.\n*   **Kb = Kw / Ka** = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48\n    **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH values are approximately **4.26** (rounding 4.25) at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<B>>>"
