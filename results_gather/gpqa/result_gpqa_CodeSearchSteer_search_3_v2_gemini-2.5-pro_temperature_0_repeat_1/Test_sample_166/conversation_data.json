    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Define the State and Parameters**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\nwith the normalization constant:\n`N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2))`\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   `phi = -pi / 4`\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n\nFirst, let's determine the specific state for these parameters:\n*   `cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(2 * -pi/4) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`\n\nSubstitute these into the normalization constant `N`:\n`N^2 = 1 + (-1) * exp(-2 * 0.5^2) = 1 - exp(-2 * 0.25) = 1 - exp(-0.5)`\n`N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5))`\n\nNow, substitute into the state vector `|psi>`:\n`|psi> = ( (1/sqrt(2))|alpha> - (1/sqrt(2))|-alpha> ) / sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5))`\n`|psi> = ( |alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-0.5)))`\nThis is a pure quantum state known as the \"odd cat state\".\n\n**2. Define the Non-Gaussianity Measure**\n\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is given by the formula:\n`del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))`\n\nThis can be rewritten in terms of von Neumann entropy, `S(X) = -trace(X * ln(X))`:\n`del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\nHere:\n*   `rho = |psi><psi|` is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.\n*   `tau` is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state. This reference state is defined as the Gaussian state having the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as `rho`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Entropy of the State `rho`**\n\nSince `|psi>` is a pure state, its density matrix `rho` has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all others equal to zero. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\n`S(rho) = 0`\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = del_b = S(tau)`\n\n**4. Determine the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nTo find `S(tau)`, we first need to find the first and second moments of `rho`.\n*   **First moment (mean displacement):** `<a> = <psi|a|psi> = 0` for the odd cat state.\n*   **Second moments:** We need `<a^2>` and the average photon number `<n> = <a_dag a>`. For the odd cat state, these are given by:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\nThe reference Gaussian state `tau` is the state with these same moments.\n\n**5. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `v`. The formula for the entropy is:\n`S(tau) = (v + 1/2) * ln(v + 1/2) - (v - 1/2) * ln(v - 1/2)`\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `v` is calculated from the covariance matrix `V` of the state. For a single-mode state, `v = sqrt(det(V))`. The elements of the covariance matrix are derived from the second moments. For a state with `<a>=0`, the covariance matrix is diagonal with elements:\n*   `V_11 = <x^2> = <n> + Re(<a^2>) + 1/2`\n*   `V_22 = <p^2> = <n> - Re(<a^2>) + 1/2`\n\nSince `<a^2> = alpha^2` is real:\n*   `V_11 = <n> + alpha^2 + 1/2`\n*   `V_22 = <n> - alpha^2 + 1/2`\n\nThe determinant is:\n`det(V) = V_11 * V_22 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - (alpha^2)^2`\nSo, the symplectic eigenvalue is:\n`v = sqrt( (<n> + 1/2)^2 - alpha^4 )`\n\n**6. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the given value `alpha = 0.5`:\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `alpha^4 = 0.0625`\n\nCalculate the average photon number `<n>`:\n*   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n*   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.25 + e^-0.25) / (e^0.25 - e^-0.25) ≈ 4.0831`\n*   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0831 = 1.0208`\n\nCalculate the symplectic eigenvalue `v`:\n*   `v = sqrt( (1.0208 + 0.5)^2 - 0.0625 )`\n*   `v = sqrt( (1.5208)^2 - 0.0625 )`\n*   `v = sqrt( 2.3128 - 0.0625 ) = sqrt(2.2503) ≈ 1.5001`\n\nFinally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n*   The value of `v` is extremely close to 1.5. Let's calculate the entropy for `v = 1.5`:\n*   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 0 = 2 * 0.6931... = 1.3862...`\n\nThe calculated non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.386. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.48\nB) 0\nC) 0.25\nD) 1.38\n\nThe value 1.38 is the closest to our calculated result. The small difference is likely due to the rounding or truncation of the value of `2*ln(2)`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
