    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction involves the rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton. The combination of a dihalide and a strong base at high temperature is known to induce complex rearrangements. In this specific case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane rearranges to form **protoadamantan-4-one** (Product 1). This structure is a ketone, which is consistent with the characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. While the reported 1H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm is unusual for a simple ketone, it can be attributed to the highly strained and unique electronic environment of the protoadamantane cage.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, followed by dehydration upon heating. The reduction of the ketone at C4 yields protoadamantan-4-ol. Subsequent elimination of water is most likely to form the more stable alkene, which is **protoadamant-4-ene** (Product 2). Formation of an alkene at this stage is crucial for the subsequent ozonolysis step.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond (C4=C5 in protoadamant-4-ene) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. This ring-opening reaction transforms the tricyclic protoadamantene into a bicyclic diketone. The resulting structure, Product 3, is **bicyclo[4.3.1]decane-4,5-dione**.\n\n### Step 4: 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[4.3.1]decane-4,5-dione, an α-diketone.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The protons most deshielded by the two carbonyl groups will be those in the alpha positions. These are the protons on C3 (a CH₂ group) and C6 (a CH bridgehead).\n*   **Coupling Pattern Analysis:** Let's analyze the coupling for the proton at the C6 bridgehead position, which is a strong candidate for being the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n    *   The H6 proton is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent bridgehead carbon, C1. This coupling will split the H6 signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   The H6 proton is also coupled to the two protons on the adjacent methylene carbon, C7. Assuming these two protons are magnetically equivalent (a common simplification in such problems), they will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining these effects, the signal for the H6 proton is expected to be a **doublet of triplets**. A similar analysis for the protons at C3 would also lead to a doublet of triplets pattern (split by the geminal proton and the two protons at C2). Therefore, regardless of whether H6 or H3 is the most deshielded, the resulting pattern is the same.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 is a doublet of triplets.\n\n<<<A>>>"
