    "The reaction between an enol and a halogen, such as bromine, is a classic example of alpha-halogenation. In this type of reaction, the double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromine.\n\nThe starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The double bond is between carbon 1 (C1), which has the hydroxyl group, and carbon 2 (C2). The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group in the corresponding ketone is called the alpha-carbon; in this enol, C2 is the alpha-carbon.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol attacks a bromine molecule (Br₂).\n2.  A bromine atom is added to the alpha-carbon (C2), and a bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated.\n3.  The intermediate oxonium ion is then deprotonated (the proton is removed from the oxygen) to regenerate the stable carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nThis process results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon with a bromine atom, forming an α-haloketone. Therefore, the hydroxyl group at C1 becomes a carbonyl group, and a bromine atom attaches to C2. The resulting major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   A) and C) would be the products of an electrophilic addition across the double bond, which is not the major pathway for an enol. The alpha-substitution reaction is favored.\n*   B) suggests bromination at the C4 position, which is a quaternary carbon and not an activated alpha-position for this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
