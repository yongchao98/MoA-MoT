    "The search results confirm the standard method for calculating the pH of a phosphate buffer and then using that to find the concentration of other species. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool for finding the pH (or [H+]) of the buffer, which is established by the H2PO4-/HPO42- pair (governed by Ka2). The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is then found using the Ka3 equilibrium expression. The Ka values provided in the problem are consistent with those found in reference materials. My calculation methodology was correct, and the initial error was a simple mistake in the final division step. The re-calculation yielded a result that matches one of the options. I am confident in the result.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   The solution contains KH2PO4, which provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), and Na2HPO4●2H2O, which provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-).\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]) = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]) = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]):**\n    *   The pH of this buffer is governed by the equilibrium between the dihydrogen phosphate (acid) and hydrogen phosphate (base). This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n    *   The equilibrium is: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n    *   Using the expression for Ka2: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-].\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]).\n    *   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.11 x 10^-8 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration ([PO4^3-]):**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n    *   The equilibrium is: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n    *   Using the expression for Ka3: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+]).\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10^-8 M).\n    *   [PO4^3-] = 6.235 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThis value rounds to 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
