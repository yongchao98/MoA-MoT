    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Diene Generation:** The compound 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, or the more common and likely intended precursor α,α,α',α'-tetrabromo-o-xylene (1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene), reacts with sodium iodide to generate a highly reactive diene in situ. This diene is o-quinodimethane (also known as o-xylylene).\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** o-quinodimethane acts as a diene and undergoes a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction) with the double bonds of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which acts as the dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, one on each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting product is a large, polycyclic molecule, which is the double adduct. The addition to norbornene systems typically proceeds from the *exo* face to minimize steric hindrance, leading to an *exo,exo*-disubstituted product.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Transformation:** The tert-butoxy group is an acid-labile protecting group for an alcohol. The strong acid protonates the ether oxygen, leading to the elimination of 2-methylpropene and the formation of a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 2:** This product has the same polycyclic carbon skeleton as Product 1, but the tert-butoxy group at the C7 position is replaced by a hydroxyl group, forming a secondary alcohol.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n*   **Transformation:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at C7 in Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone (a carbonyl group, C=O).\n*   **Product 3:** This is the ketone corresponding to the alcohol Product 2. It is a complex polycyclic ketone with the carbonyl group at the C7 bridge of the original norbornane core. The *exo,exo* nature of the addition results in Product 3 having C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n### **Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and heating an adduct can cause a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. At this temperature, it is plausible for one of the two Diels-Alder adducts to break apart. The double adduct (Product 3) reverts to the mono-adduct ketone (Product 4) and one molecule of o-quinodimethane. While other reactions like CO extrusion are possible for such ketones, they often require much higher temperatures or photolysis, and the retro-Diels-Alder reaction provides a path to a product whose features match the provided options.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is the mono-Diels-Alder adduct ketone.\n\n### **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of Product 4.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** It consists of a 7-ketonorbornene core fused to one o-quinodimethane adduct (at the former C2-C3 double bond). Assuming the thermodynamically favored *exo* adduct, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (Cₛ symmetry). This plane passes through the C7 carbonyl group and bisects the C1-C4 bond, the C2-C3 bond (now saturated), and the C5=C6 double bond.\n*   **Symmetry and Equivalence:** Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like reflection through the mirror plane) are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal in an NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's count the sets of equivalent protons in Product 4:\n1.  **Bridgehead Protons:** The protons on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4) are reflected into each other by the mirror plane. Thus, they are equivalent. (1 set of 2H)\n2.  **Alkene Protons:** The protons on the double bond (C5 and C6) are equivalent as they are interchanged by the mirror plane. (1 set of 2H)\n3.  **Fusion Methine Protons:** The protons on the carbons where the adduct is fused (C2 and C3) are also equivalent by reflection. (1 set of 2H)\n4.  **Adduct Methylene Protons:** The adduct contains two methylene (-CH₂) groups. The mirror plane interchanges these two groups, making them equivalent. However, within each methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments, one \"pointing up\" and one \"pointing down\" relative to the ring system) and are not interchangeable by symmetry. Therefore, these four protons form two distinct sets. (2 sets of 2H each)\n5.  **Adduct Aromatic Protons:** The adduct contains a benzene ring. The mirror plane passes through this ring, making the protons on one side equivalent to the protons on the other. The four aromatic protons are thus divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. (2 sets of 2H each)\n\n**Total number of sets of chemically distinct hydrogens = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
