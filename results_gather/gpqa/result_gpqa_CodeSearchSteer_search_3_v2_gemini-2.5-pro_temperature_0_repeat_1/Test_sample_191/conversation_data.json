    "Due to the principles of electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside the material of the spherical conductor must be zero. When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a negative charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a positive charge +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\nThis induced charge +q on the outer surface distributes itself uniformly, irrespective of the position of the charge +q inside the cavity. This uniform distribution ensures that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.\n\nThe electric field at any point outside the spherical conductor is solely determined by the charge on its outer surface. Because the +q charge is distributed uniformly over the spherical outer surface of radius R, the electric field it produces at an external point P is the same as that of a point charge +q located at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor, is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe location of the cavity, defined by the distance $s$, and the specific position of the charge within the cavity, which influences the distance $l$ and the angle $\\theta$, do not affect the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n<<<C>>>"
