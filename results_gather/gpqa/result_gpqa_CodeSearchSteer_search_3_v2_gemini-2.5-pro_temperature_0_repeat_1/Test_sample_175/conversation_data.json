    "The search results confirm the methodology I used. Here's a summary of the key principles and how they apply to the problem:\n\n1.  **Born Rule**: The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `A` in a system described by a normalized state `|ψ⟩` is given by `P(λ) = |⟨λ|ψ⟩|^2`, where `|λ⟩` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`. This is precisely the formula I used to calculate the probability of measuring P=0.\n\n2.  **Wave Function Collapse**: When a measurement is performed, the system's state \"collapses\" from its initial superposition to the eigenstate corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. After measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the system's state is no longer the initial state `|ψ⟩` but becomes the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. This is a crucial step in my calculation.\n\n3.  **Sequential Measurements**: For a sequence of measurements, the probability of the entire sequence is the product of the probabilities of each step, taking into account the state collapse at each measurement. The probability of measuring Q=-1 is calculated using the state *after* the measurement of P, which is `|p_0⟩`. The total probability is then the product of `Prob(P=0)` and `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |p_0⟩)`.\n\nThe steps I followed are:\n1.  Normalize the initial state `|ψ⟩`.\n2.  Find the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` for the first measurement's outcome (P=0).\n3.  Calculate the probability of the first measurement: `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ⟩|^2`.\n4.  The state collapses to `|p_0⟩`.\n5.  Find the eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩` for the second measurement's outcome (Q=-1).\n6.  Calculate the probability of the second measurement on the collapsed state: `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q_{-1}|p_0⟩|^2`.\n7.  Calculate the total probability: `Total Prob = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1)`.\n\nMy calculations yielded a total probability of 1/6. The methodology is sound and confirmed by the literature. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n*   `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n*   `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n*   `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|^2 = |(1/√12) * (-1 - 1)|^2 = |-2/√12|^2 = |-1/√3|^2 = 1/3`.\n*   State collapses to `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n*   `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n*   `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|p_0⟩|^2 = |(1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))|^2 = |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2`.\n*   Total Probability = `(1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe calculation is correct. The answer is 1/6. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
