    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to its anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (C=C) and 165 ppm (C=O). This is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two equivalent vinylic protons give a single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons give two distinct ¹³C peaks.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a cyclic diene locked in the reactive *s-cis* conformation, making it highly reactive in Diels-Alder reactions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, specifically a Diels-Alder reaction, between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes and substituted dienophiles can produce two diastereomeric products: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structures of the Major (Endo) and Minor (Exo) Products:**\n    *   **Product Skeleton:** The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core. The anhydride is fused at the 5- and 6-positions. The original C5 of the cyclopentadiene becomes the C7 methylene bridge. The new double bond is between C2 and C3. There are methyl groups at C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 methylene bridge. This places the protons on C5 and C6 (which come from the maleic anhydride) in the *exo* position, pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 methylene bridge. This places the protons on C5 and C6 in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Spectra and NOESY Data:**\n    *   **Proton Signals:** Based on the product structure and typical chemical shifts for similar bicyclic systems, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options:\n        *   **~1 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (describes a 1H doublet, but represents the 2H methylene bridge):** These are the protons on the C7 bridge.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two methyl groups on the vinylic carbons (C2 and C3).\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the structure (at C5 and C6).\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** This technique shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one must arise from a spatial proximity unique to the major (*endo*) isomer.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity in the Major (Endo) Product:** In the *endo* structure, the protons at C5 and C6 (~3.5 ppm) are in the *exo* position. This places them close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two sets of protons.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity in the Minor (Exo) Product:** In the *exo* structure, the protons at C5 and C6 (~3.5 ppm) are in the *endo* position. This places them far from the vinylic methyl groups but close to the C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The cross-peak observed in the major product but not the minor product connects the protons at C5/C6 with the vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3.\n\n5.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    *   The interaction is between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Bridgehead methyls and bridge protons. Not the key differentiating interaction.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls. These are too far apart.\n    *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Bridge protons and anhydride protons. This interaction is characteristic of the *minor (exo)* product.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Vinylic methyls and anhydride protons. This interaction is characteristic of the *major (endo)* product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
