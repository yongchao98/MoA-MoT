    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (v) = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (the proper time, Δt₀) = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Understand the concept:** According to special relativity, time passes at different rates for observers in different inertial frames of reference. An observer in the Galaxy's reference frame will measure a longer time interval (Δt) compared to the time interval measured in the ejecta's reference frame (Δt₀). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** The factor by which time is dilated is called the Lorentz factor, calculated with the formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n    First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\n    Now, substitute this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n4.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):** The time dilation formula is:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n\n    Substitute the values of γ and Δt₀:\n    Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame:** The distance is the velocity of the ejecta multiplied by the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    Distance (d) = v * Δt\n    d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s]\n    d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km\n    d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km\n\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    √(0.96) ≈ 0.9798\n    d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km\n    d ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored).\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km (This would be the result of incorrectly applying the Lorentz factor, causing time contraction instead of dilation).\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km.\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
