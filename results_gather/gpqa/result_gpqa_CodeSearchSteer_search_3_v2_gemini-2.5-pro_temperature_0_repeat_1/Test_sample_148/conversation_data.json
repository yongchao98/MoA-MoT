    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the observations to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the NMR Data:** The Â¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct for one proton. This immediately suggests the presence of two different, but very similar, chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two species must be isomers. Enantiomers are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment, so this observation rules out option D. The two species must therefore be diastereomers. Diastereomers are chemically distinct and are expected to have different NMR spectra.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity that can be separated chromatographically, in this case at an elevated temperature. This confirms the presence of two distinct compounds that have different physical properties. The mass spectrometry data reveals that both peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This rules out contamination with a precursor (option C), which would have a different mass. The identical mass confirms that the two species are isomers.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Both NMR and LC-MS data point to the presence of a ~1:1 mixture of two isomers with the same mass. The NMR data specifically indicates they are diastereomers, not enantiomers. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n4.  **Consider the Chemical Context:** In chemically synthesized peptides, there are common reasons for the formation of diastereomers:\n    *   **Epimerization:** During synthesis, the stereocenter of an amino acid (the alpha-carbon) can be inverted. If the peptide contains other chiral centers, this creates a diastereomer. For example, if a peptide meant to be L-Ala-L-Phe undergoes epimerization at the alanine residue, a mixture of L-Ala-L-Phe and D-Ala-L-Phe results. These are diastereomers and are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR.\n    *   ***Cis-Trans* Isomerism:** The amide bond, particularly one preceding a proline residue, can exist in both *cis* and *trans* conformations. These conformers are diastereomers, and their interconversion is often slow on the NMR timescale, leading to two sets of peaks. They can often be separated by LC.\n    *   **Atropisomerism:** Restricted rotation around a single bond due to steric hindrance can create stable, separable rotational isomers called atropisomers, which are a type of diastereomer. This is also observed by NMR as separate sets of signals.\n\nAll of these possibilities fall under the umbrella of diastereomerism. Option A, \"double coupling,\" is a term related to the synthesis procedure to improve yield and does not explain the formation of isomers with the same mass.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combined evidence from NMR (two distinct peaks for one proton, ruling out enantiomers) and LC-MS (two separable peaks with identical mass, ruling out contaminants) strongly supports the conclusion that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
