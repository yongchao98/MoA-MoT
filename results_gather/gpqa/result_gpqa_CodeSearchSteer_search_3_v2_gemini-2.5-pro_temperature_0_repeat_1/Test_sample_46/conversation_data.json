    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from an ester group.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to an oxygen atom within an ester functionality (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are likely adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining the evidence:\n*   The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 4.0 ppm confirm a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   The IR signal at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the ¹H NMR signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The ¹H NMR signals at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm indicate a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This compound is also commonly known as benzocaine. The molecular formula for this structure is C9H11NO2, which matches the given information.\n\n### Evaluation of a Possible Alternative\n\nLet's consider another isomer, ethyl 2-aminobenzoate (ethyl anthranilate), to see why it is not the correct answer. While it also has the same molecular formula and functional groups, its ¹H NMR spectrum would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region due to the 1,2-disubstitution, rather than two clean doublets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data provided is fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Published spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms these assignments.\n\n<<<B>>>"
