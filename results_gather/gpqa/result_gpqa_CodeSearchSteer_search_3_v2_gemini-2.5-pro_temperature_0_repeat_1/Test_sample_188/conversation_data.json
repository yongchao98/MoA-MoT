    "When a continuous symmetry of a physical system is spontaneously broken, Goldstone's theorem predicts the existence of massless (or light, if the symmetry is also explicitly broken) particles known as Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Analyzing each of the given particles in this context reveals their association with this phenomenon.\n\n*   **Phonon:** In a crystalline solid, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken because the atoms are fixed in a lattice. Phonons are the collective excitations of this lattice and are identified as the Goldstone bosons corresponding to this broken translational symmetry.\n\n*   **Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics), there is an approximate chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken, which would lead to massless Goldstone bosons. However, because the quarks have a small mass, this symmetry is not exact (it is explicitly broken as well). The resulting particles, the pions, are therefore not massless but are significantly lighter than other hadrons. They are known as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **Magnon:** In a ferromagnet, the spins of the atoms align in a particular direction, spontaneously breaking the continuous rotational symmetry of the system. Magnons, or spin waves, are the collective excitations of these aligned spins and are the Goldstone bosons associated with this broken rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, localized field configuration. It is considered a topological soliton, not a Nambu-Goldstone boson. While the formation of skyrmions is related to broken symmetries (for instance, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that can stabilize them arises from broken inversion symmetry), the skyrmion itself is a massive, particle-like excitation whose existence is guaranteed by the topology of the field configuration, not by the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in the sense of Goldstone's theorem. It is a distinct type of excitation from a Goldstone boson. Although a crystal of skyrmions can have Goldstone modes corresponding to the breaking of translational symmetry by the crystal itself, the individual skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson.\n\nTherefore, the phonon, pion, and magnon are all (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. The skyrmion is a topological excitation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
