    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first find the color of the light it emits. The energy of the emitted light is given, and from this, we can calculate the corresponding wavelength.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\n\nThe relationship between the energy (E) of a photon and its wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\n\nλ = hc / E\n\nwhere:\n-   *h* is Planck's constant (4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n-   *c* is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n-   *E* is the energy in electron volts (eV)\n\nA simplified and commonly used formula to convert energy in eV directly to wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nGiven the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\nλ ≈ 530.07 nm\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Color of the Emitted Light\n\nThe calculated wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum. The visible spectrum is generally considered to be between 380 nm and 750 nm, with green light typically in the range of 495 nm to 570 nm.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Absorbed Color\n\nAn object's perceived color is complementary to the color of light it absorbs. Since the textile dye emits green light, it must absorb the complementary color of green. On a standard color wheel, the complementary color to green is red.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
