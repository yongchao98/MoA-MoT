    "The search results confirm that Grubbs catalysts are used for olefin metathesis, a reaction that swaps the groups around a double bond. The reaction of a terminal alkene with itself (self-metathesis) produces a new internal, disubstituted alkene and ethene. The search results also mention that standard Grubbs catalysts do not control the geometry (E/Z) of the newly formed double bond, often resulting in a mixture. The searches also discuss stereoselective metathesis using chiral catalysts, but the question specifies a standard (achiral) Grubbs catalyst.\n\nMy initial step-by-step analysis of the reaction of a racemic mixture appears correct.\n\n1.  **Reactants**: A 50/50 mix of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n2.  **Reaction**: Self-metathesis, which will occur in three ways: R+R, S+S, and R+S.\n3.  **Product (excluding ethene)**: 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n4.  **Stereoisomers**:\n    *   **R+R reaction**: Produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This can exist as two diastereomers due to the new double bond: (E)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3R,6R).\n    *   **S+S reaction**: Produces (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This also exists as two diastereomers: (E)-(3S,6S) and (Z)-(3S,6S). These are the enantiomers of the products from the R+R reaction.\n    *   **R+S reaction**: Produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This compound is a meso compound. It can also exist as two diastereomeric forms based on the double bond geometry: (E)-(3R,6S) and (Z)-(3R,6S).\n\nThis gives a total of 6 distinct stereoisomeric products. The logic holds.\n\nFinal check:\n-   Pair 1: (E)-(3R,6R) and (E)-(3S,6S) are enantiomers.\n-   Pair 2: (Z)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3S,6S) are enantiomers.\n-   Pair 3: (E)-(3R,6S) is a meso compound.\n-   Pair 4: (Z)-(3R,6S) is a meso compound.\n\nAll four pairs are distinct from each other (they are diastereomers). Therefore, there are 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 possible products.\n\nThe answer is 6. This corresponds to option C.\n\nThe reaction is the self-metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Since the starting material is racemic, it is a 1:1 mixture of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe general reaction for self-metathesis of a terminal alkene (R-CH=CH₂) is:\n2 R-CH=CH₂ → R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n\nIn this case, R is the chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The product, excluding ethene, is 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n\nWe must consider the three possible reaction pairings in the racemic mixture:\n1.  **(R)-alkene + (R)-alkene**: This reaction produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. The new double bond at the 4-position can be either E or Z. This gives two products: (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene and (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. These are diastereomers.\n2.  **(S)-alkene + (S)-alkene**: This reaction produces (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. Again, both E and Z isomers of the double bond can form. This gives two more products: (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene and (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. The (E,S,S) product is the enantiomer of the (E,R,R) product, and the (Z,S,S) product is the enantiomer of the (Z,R,R) product. So far, we have 4 distinct stereoisomers.\n3.  **(R)-alkene + (S)-alkene (cross-metathesis)**: This reaction produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry (for the Z-isomer) or a center of inversion (for the E-isomer), making it achiral despite having two chiral centers. The E and Z isomers are diastereomers of each other and of all the other products. This gives two more distinct products: (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene and (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n\nIn total, we have 2 (from R+R) + 2 (from S+S) + 2 (from R+S) = 6 possible stereoisomeric products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
