    "A dominant-negative mutation occurs when a mutated protein not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the normal allele. This is common in proteins that need to form dimers or larger complexes to be active.\n\nIn this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to function. The cell is heterozygous for mutation Y in the dimerization domain, meaning it produces both normal (wild-type) and mutant protein subunits.\n\nHere's the molecular breakdown:\n1.  **Dimer Formation:** The mutant protein (Y) is still able to dimerize with the wild-type (WT) protein. If it couldn't dimerize at all, it wouldn't be able to interfere with the wild-type protein, and the mutation would likely be recessive.\n2.  **Interference:** The mutant Y subunit forms a heterodimer with a wild-type subunit (WT-Y).\n3.  **Loss of Function:** Because the mutation is in the dimerization domain, the resulting heterodimer is non-functional. It cannot bind DNA effectively or activate transcription. This \"poisons\" the wild-type subunit that is part of the complex.\n4.  **Dominant Effect:** This sequestration of wild-type subunits into inactive heterodimers significantly reduces the number of functional wild-type homodimers (WT-WT). The overall functional protein level drops below the 50% that would be seen in a simple loss-of-function heterozygote, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even in the presence of a normal allele.\n5.  **Protein Degradation:** Often, such malformed or non-functional protein complexes are recognized by the cell's quality control machinery and targeted for degradation.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this understanding:\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative effect requires the mutant to interact with the wild-type. Also, a loss of functional protein would not result in a wild-type phenotype.\n*   **B) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While possible, the primary mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimer is the formation of non-functional heterodimers, not necessarily large-scale aggregation. The key is the interference with the wild-type protein.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most accurate description. The mutant protein's interference leads to a functional loss of the wild-type allele's product by sequestering it in an inactive complex. This aberrant complex is often targeted for degradation, compounding the loss of function.\n\n<<<D>>>"
