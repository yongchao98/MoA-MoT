    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n1.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth**: The transit depth is given by the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, which simplifies to (R_pl / R_star)². This is confirmed by multiple sources.\n\n2.  **Starspot Rotational Modulation**: The flux variation (and thus the light curve amplitude) due to starspots is related to the temperature difference between the photosphere and the spots, as well as the area covered by the spots. My derived formula, `Amplitude = f_spots * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`, correctly uses the Stefan-Boltzmann law (flux ∝ T⁴) to model this brightness difference. The \"filling factor\" `f_spots` represents the fraction of the visible stellar disk covered by spots when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer.\n\nThe calculations performed were:\n1.  Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the rotating star.\n    *   `Amplitude_spots = f_spots * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.10355`\n\n2.  Equate this to the dimming caused by an exoplanet transit.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n3.  Solve for the relative planet radius.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis result is very close to the option D, which is 0.32. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the option itself. `(0.32)² = 0.1024`, which is very close to the calculated `0.10355`.\n\nThe logic and calculations are sound and confirmed by the literature. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal as the spotted star, a hypothetical exoplanet would need to cause a specific amount of dimming during its transit. Here is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the amplitude of the signal from the starspots.**\n    The brightness of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law). The variation in brightness is caused by the rotation of the star, which alternately shows a brighter, unspotted hemisphere and a dimmer, spotted hemisphere.\n\n    The maximum flux (F_max) is observed from the unspotted hemisphere, proportional to T_eff⁴.\n    The minimum flux (F_min) is observed from the spotted hemisphere. On this side, 20% of the area has a temperature of T_spot, and 80% has a temperature of T_eff.\n    *   T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Filling factor (f_spots) = 0.20\n\n    The relative amplitude of this variation is calculated as:\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    This simplifies to:\n    Amplitude = f_spots * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n    Plugging in the values:\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\n    Amplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n2.  **Relate the amplitude to an exoplanet transit.**\n    The dimming caused by an exoplanet transit is equal to the ratio of the planet's cross-sectional area to the star's cross-sectional area.\n    Transit Amplitude = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n3.  **Solve for the relative radius of the exoplanet (R_pl / R_star).**\n    To produce the same signal, the transit amplitude must equal the starspot amplitude:\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
