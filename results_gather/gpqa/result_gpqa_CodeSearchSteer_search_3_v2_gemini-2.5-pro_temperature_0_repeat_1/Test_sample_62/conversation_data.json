    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy of the transition from the molecule's fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy.\n\n### 1. Define the Energy Levels\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational**\n*   E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (given as 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s)\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identify the Transition\n\nThe fundamental (ground) state is the state with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to `v=0` and `J=0`.\n\nThe \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" requires a transition governed by spectroscopic selection rules for the absorption of a photon. For rovibrational transitions, the rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only allowed transition to a higher energy level is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot be negative).\n\nTherefore, the transition is from the initial state (v₀=0, J₀=0) to the final state (v₁=1, J₁=1).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **ΔE = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)**\n\n*   **E_initial = E(0, 0)** = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final = E(1, 1)** = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\n*   **ΔE** = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = **ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4. Calculate Numerical Values\n\nFirst, we need the moment of inertia, `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    *   Mx = 20 amu\n    *   My = 2 amu\n    *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    *   Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    *   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   I = μR² ≈ (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2072 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the two parts of the energy difference:\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    *   ΔE_vib = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (ħ²/I):**\n    *   ΔE_rot = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2072 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.2 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)\n\nThe relationship between a photon's energy and momentum is E = pc.\n\n*   **p = ΔE / c**\n*   p = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   **p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\nThis value is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
