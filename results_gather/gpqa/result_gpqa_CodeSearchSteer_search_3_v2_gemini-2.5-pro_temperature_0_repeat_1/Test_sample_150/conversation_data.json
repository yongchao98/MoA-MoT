    "To calculate the probability that a measurement of an observable will yield a specific eigenvalue, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Find the eigenvalues and corresponding normalized eigenvectors of the observable's matrix operator.**\n2.  **Normalize the given state vector of the system.**\n3.  **Calculate the inner product (or dot product) of the normalized eigenvector (corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest) and the normalized state vector.**\n4.  **The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product.**\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given problem.\n\n**Given:**\n*   State vector at time t, |ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n*   Observable operator, P = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n**Step 1: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P**\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.\n```\n| -λ   1/√2    0   |\n| 1/√2  -λ   1/√2  | = 0\n|  0   1/√2   -λ   |\n```\n-λ(λ² - 1/2) - 1/√2(-λ/√2) = 0\n-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ = 0\nλ(1 - λ²) = 0\nThis gives the eigenvalues λ = 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the measurement yielding 0. So, we need the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.\nTo find the eigenvector |v₀⟩, we solve (P - 0I)|v₀⟩ = 0, which is P|v₀⟩ = 0.\nLet |v₀⟩ = `[[x], [y], [z]]`.\n```\n[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [[0], [0], [0]]\n```\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n3.  (1/√2)y = 0 => y = 0\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[[x], [0], [-x]]`. To normalize it, the length must be 1.\n||v₀||² = x² + 0² + (-x)² = 2x² = 1 => x = 1/√2.\nSo, the normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is |v₀⟩ = `[[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`.\n\n**Step 2: Normalize the state vector |ψ⟩**\n\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\nThe squared norm is ||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\nThe normalized state vector is |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the inner product ⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩**\n\nThe inner product ⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ is the dot product of the row vector ⟨v₀| and the column vector |ψ_norm⟩.\n⟨v₀| = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]` · (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n= (1/√6) * [(1/√2)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1)]\n= (1/√6) * [-1/√2 - 1/√2]\n= (1/√6) * [-2/√2]\n= (1/√6) * [-√2]\n= -√(2/6) = -√(1/3) = -1/√3\n\n**Step 4: Square the absolute value of the inner product**\n\nThe probability P(0) is |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|².\nP(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
