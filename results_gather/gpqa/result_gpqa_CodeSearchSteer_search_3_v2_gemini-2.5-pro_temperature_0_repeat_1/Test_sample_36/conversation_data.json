    "The search results confirm the principles of Wittig reactions and 13C-NMR spectroscopy.\n\n1.  **Wittig Reaction Confirmation**: The Wittig reaction involves an aldehyde or ketone reacting with a phosphorus ylide to form an alkene. The ylide is typically prepared by reacting triphenylphosphine with an alkyl halide, followed by deprotonation with a strong base like BuLi. The reaction of 3-pentanone with the ylide from 3-bromopentane would indeed produce 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n2.  **13C-NMR Spectroscopy Principles**: The number of signals in a proton-decoupled 13C-NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent carbons in a molecule. Symmetry in a molecule reduces the number of signals, as symmetrical carbons are chemically equivalent. For example, pentane has 5 carbons but only shows 3 signals due to a plane of symmetry.\n\n3.  **Analysis of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**: The final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene (C10H20). This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of symmetry (or a C2 axis of rotation) that makes the two carbons of the C=C double bond equivalent. This symmetry also makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\nBased on this symmetry, we can determine the number of unique carbon environments:\n*   All four methyl (CH3) carbons are equivalent.\n*   All four methylene (CH2) carbons are equivalent.\n*   The two sp2-hybridized carbons of the double bond (C=C) are equivalent.\n\nThis results in a total of 3 unique carbon signals. Therefore, the 13C-NMR spectrum of product E will show 3 signals.\n\nThe step-by-step chemical transformation is as follows:\n*   **Step 1:** Propionaldehyde is protected with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to form compound **A**, 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n*   **Step 2:** Compound **A** is deprotonated by butyllithium (BuLi) to form a lithiated dithiane, compound **B**.\n*   **Step 3:** Compound **B** reacts with bromoethane in a nucleophilic substitution to yield compound **C**, 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n*   **Step 4:** The dithiane group in **C** is removed using mercury(II) chloride (HgCl2) and water to give the ketone, compound **D**, which is 3-pentanone.\n*   **Step 5:** Compound **D** undergoes a Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent is formed from 3-bromopentane, triphenylphosphine (PPh3), and BuLi. This reagent reacts with 3-pentanone to produce the final product **E**, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\nThe structure of **E** is (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2. Due to the high degree of symmetry in this molecule, there are only three distinct types of carbon atoms. Consequently, the 13C-NMR spectrum will display 3 signals.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n- Reaction sequence is plausible and correctly interpreted.\n- Final product structure is correct.\n- Symmetry analysis of the final product is correct.\n- Principles of 13C NMR are correctly applied.\nThe conclusion of 3 signals is consistent and well-supported.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
