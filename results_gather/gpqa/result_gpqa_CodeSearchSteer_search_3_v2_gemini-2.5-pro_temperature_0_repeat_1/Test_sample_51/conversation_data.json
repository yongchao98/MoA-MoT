    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere. Since the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (N₁ and N₂) is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe ratio of an upper energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n\n(N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and 2, respectively.\n*   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constant for the levels in question).\n*   E₁ and E₂ are the energies of the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Interpret the Observation**\n\nThe problem states that the observed ratio \"decreases when the star has spots.\" Starspots are cooler regions, so the presence of spots lowers the star's overall effective temperature. In this case, the temperature drops from 6000 K (no spots) to 5500 K (with spots).\n\nLet's analyze how the ratio (N₂ / N₁) changes with temperature. Since E₂ is a higher energy level than E₁, the term (E₂ - E₁) is positive. As the temperature (T) decreases, the value of 1/T increases. This makes the negative exponent -(E₂ - E₁)/(k*T) decrease (become more negative). Consequently, the exponential term `exp[-(E₂ - E₁)/(k*T)]` also decreases.\n\nThis matches the observation that the ratio decreases as the temperature drops. Therefore, the ratio being measured is N₂/N₁.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Difference (E₂ - E₁)**\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). This is described by the Planck-Einstein relation.\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\nFor convenience in the Boltzmann equation, we can calculate the term (E₂ - E₁) / k directly:\n\n(E₂ - E₁) / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n(E₂ - E₁) / k = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m * 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K)\n(E₂ - E₁) / k ≈ 99477 K\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Ratios**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\" This means we need to calculate:\n\nFactor = Ratio (at 6000 K) / Ratio (at 5500 K)\n\nLet R(T) = (N₂ / N₁) at a given temperature T.\nR(T) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-99477 / T]\n\nFactor = { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-99477 / 6000] } / { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-99477 / 5500] }\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancel out:\n\nFactor = exp[-99477 / 6000] / exp[-99477 / 5500]\nFactor = exp[(-99477 / 6000) - (-99477 / 5500)]\nFactor = exp[99477 * (1/5500 - 1/6000)]\nFactor = exp[99477 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) )]\nFactor = exp[99477 * (500 / 33,000,000)]\nFactor = exp[1.507]\nFactor ≈ 4.51\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
