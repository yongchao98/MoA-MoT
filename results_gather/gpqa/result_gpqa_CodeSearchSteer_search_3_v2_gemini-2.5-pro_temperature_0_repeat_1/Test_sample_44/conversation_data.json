    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then apply the Pauli exclusion principle for the four spin-1/2 particles (fermions).\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy for a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 'L' is quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the ground state energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the energy of the n-th level is:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   **n=1:** E₁ = 1²E = E\n*   **n=2:** E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   **n=3:** E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   **n=4:** E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n\n### Multi-Particle System and the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, which makes them fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number 'n' and the spin quantum number (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\n**Ground State Energy:**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions.\n*   Two particles go into the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = 2 × E₁ + 2 × E₂\nE_ground = 2 × (E) + 2 × (4E)\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**First Excited State Energy:**\nTo obtain the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration is (n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles).\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is (n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 1 particle, n=3: 1 particle).\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2 × E₁ + 1 × E₂ + 1 × E₃\nE_first_excited = 2 × (E) + 1 × (4E) + 1 × (9E)\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**Second Excited State Energy:**\nFor the second excited state, we need to find the next lowest energy configuration. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes (n=1: 1 particle, n=2: 2 particles, n=3: 1 particle).\n    *   Energy = 1×E₁ + 2×E₂ + 1×E₃ = 1×E + 2×(4E) + 1×(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n2.  Move both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration becomes (n=1: 2 particles, n=3: 2 particles).\n    *   Energy = 2×E₁ + 2×E₃ = 2×E + 2×(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Move one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes (n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 1 particle, n=4: 1 particle).\n    *   Energy = 2×E₁ + 1×E₂ + 1×E₄ = 2×E + 1×(4E) + 1×(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
