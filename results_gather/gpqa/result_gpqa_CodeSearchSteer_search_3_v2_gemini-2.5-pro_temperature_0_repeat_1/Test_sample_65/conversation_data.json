    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parameterize potential new physics at energy scales beyond the electroweak scale. The construction of these operators must adhere to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n**1. Lorentz Symmetry and 2. Poincaré Symmetry:**\nThe SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory, and as such, its Lagrangian is required to be invariant under Poincaré transformations. The Poincaré group includes spacetime translations, rotations, and boosts. Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) form a subgroup of the Poincaré group. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry. This ensures that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.\n\n**3. CP Symmetry:**\nCP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity transformation (P). While the Standard Model itself contains a small amount of CP violation in the quark sector, the SMEFT provides a framework to parameterize additional sources of CP violation from new physics. There are numerous operators in the SMEFT that are explicitly CP-violating. The existence and study of these operators are a significant area of SMEFT phenomenology. Consequently, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n**4. CPT Symmetry:**\nThe CPT theorem is a fundamental principle in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must obey the CPT theorem. A violation of CPT symmetry would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT are required to be CPT-invariant.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
