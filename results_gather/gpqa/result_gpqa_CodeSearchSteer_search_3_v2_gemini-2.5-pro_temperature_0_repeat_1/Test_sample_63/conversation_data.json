    "The analysis based on the products and their quantities logically led to identifying the salts as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The google search confirms the decomposition reactions that were hypothesized.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) decomposition:** The primary products are nitrogen gas (N₂) and water (H₂O). The reaction is: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) decomposition:** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is more complex and depends on the temperature. At temperatures between 185-200°C, it primarily decomposes into nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water. However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can undergo explosive decomposition to produce nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and water (H₂O). The balanced equation for this reaction is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nGiven that the products found in the experiment are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, it is clear that this second, more complete decomposition of ammonium nitrate occurred.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation was as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine moles of products:**\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g → 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol H₂O.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g → 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂.\n    *   Volume of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L at STP → 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n2.  **Set up reaction equations with an unknown molar amount 'n' for each salt:**\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 0.5n O₂ + 2n H₂O (This is based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio from the balanced equation).\n\n3.  **Sum the products and equate to the experimental values:**\n    *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n = 0.1 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products.\n\n4.  **Verify the initial mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = 0.05 mol * (64.04 g/mol + 80.04 g/mol) = 0.05 * 144.08 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given weight of 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe result is consistent and confirmed by the literature.\n\n<<<D>>>"
