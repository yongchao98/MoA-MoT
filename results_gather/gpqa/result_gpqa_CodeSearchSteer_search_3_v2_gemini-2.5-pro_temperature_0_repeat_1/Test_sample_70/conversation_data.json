    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. This energy decreases with the square of the distance from the star. The temperature is proportional to the fourth root of the incoming energy flux. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, 'a'). The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n\n2.  **Relate orbital distance to orbital period using Kepler's Third Law.** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be expressed as P² ∝ a³.\n\n3.  **Use the given ratios to find the temperature ratio.**\n    *   The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   From this, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2:\n        P₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\n    *   Now, using Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n        (a₄ / a₂ )³ = (P₄ / P₂ )²\n        a₄ / a₂ = (P₄ / P₂ )^(2/3)\n        a₄ / a₂ = (1.75)^(2/3)\n\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star. Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures (T₄ / T₂) depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n        T₄ / T₂ = √(a₂ / a₄) = (a₄ / a₂)⁻¹ᐟ²\n\n    *   Substituting the expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n        T₄ / T₂ = ((1.75)^(2/3))⁻¹ᐟ²\n        T₄ / T₂ = (1.75)⁻¹ᐟ³\n        T₄ / T₂ = 1 / (1.75)¹ᐟ³\n\n    *   Calculating the numerical value:\n        T₄ / T₂ ≈ 1 / 1.205\n        T₄ / T₂ ≈ 0.83\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the closest value is ~0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
