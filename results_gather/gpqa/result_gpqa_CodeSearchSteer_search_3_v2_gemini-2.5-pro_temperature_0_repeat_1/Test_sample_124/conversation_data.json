    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number (a non-negative integer), and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe energy levels are:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThe value of the energy for the third excited state is therefore $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. For the nth energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, is given by the formula:\n\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n=3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula gives:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$\n\nThis degeneracy arises from the number of different combinations of the non-negative integer quantum numbers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to n=3. These combinations are:\n*   One quantum number is 3, and the others are 0 (e.g., (3,0,0)): 3 permutations.\n*   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0 (e.g., (2,1,0)): 6 permutations.\n*   All three quantum numbers are 1 (i.e., (1,1,1)): 1 combination.\n\nThe total number of combinations is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\nBased on this, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
