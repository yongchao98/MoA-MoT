    "Of the molecules listed, triisopropyl borate is the one that possesses C3h symmetry. This determination is based on an analysis of the symmetry elements for each molecule.\n\n*   **Triisopropyl borate (C)**: This molecule, with the formula B(O-i-Pr)₃, can adopt a conformation where the central boron-oxygen core is planar. The three isopropyl groups can be arranged in a propeller-like fashion, either all pointing up or all down from this plane. This arrangement results in a C₃ rotation axis perpendicular to the BO₃ plane and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that lies within the BO₃ plane. These are the characteristic symmetry elements of the C3h point group. It is analogous to boric acid (B(OH)₃), a classic example of a molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n*   **Quinuclidine (D)**: This bicyclic amine has a cage-like structure. It possesses a C₃ axis that passes through the nitrogen and the bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C₃ axis. Therefore, its point group is C3v, not C3h.\n\n*   **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A)**: Also known as mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is not planar. X-ray crystallography studies have shown that it adopts a \"shallow propeller\" shape. This non-planar structure, which has approximate D3 symmetry, lacks the horizontal mirror plane required for the C3h point group.\n\n*   **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (B)**: There is no readily available information confirming the point group of this complex molecule. However, given its intricate and likely non-planar structure, it is improbable that it would possess the specific combination of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane required for C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule with C3h symmetry among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
