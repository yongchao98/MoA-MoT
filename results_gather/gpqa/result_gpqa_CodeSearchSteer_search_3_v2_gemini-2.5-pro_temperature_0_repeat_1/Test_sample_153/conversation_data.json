    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The base peak is at an m/z of 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion. Its intensity is 32% of the M+ peak. This M/M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with this finding.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** A very broad absorption in this region is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules, which often exist as dimers.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This conclusion eliminates option **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde with a hydroxyl group) and **C) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an acid chloride/ester and lacks an O-H group). We are now left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet with an integration of one proton, appearing far downfield. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm).\n    *   Both signals are doublets ('d').\n    *   Each signal integrates to two protons ('2H').\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, symmetry causes the two protons on one side of the ring to be chemically equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side to also be equivalent. This results in a simplified spectrum that often appears as two doublets.\n*   **Evaluating Remaining Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is para-substituted. It would exhibit the two-doublet pattern for its four aromatic protons, which perfectly matches the observed data.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is ortho-substituted. The four aromatic protons are all in unique chemical environments, which would lead to a more complex splitting pattern, likely with four separate signals (e.g., doublets of doublets, multiplets), not the simple two-doublet pattern seen here.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The NMR data is only consistent with a 1,4-disubstituted (para) structure.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the information from all three spectroscopic techniques, the identity of the unknown compound can be confidently determined. The mass spectrum indicates a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR and NMR data confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid. Finally, the specific splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum points exclusively to a para-substituted benzene ring. Therefore, the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
