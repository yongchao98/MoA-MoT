    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2), all in a meta relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the options and the chemical principles involved:\n\n*   **Substituent Effects:** In electrophilic aromatic substitution, the order in which substituents are added is crucial.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the nitro group (-NO2) are electron-withdrawing and are **meta-directors**.\n    *   The bromo group (-Br) is deactivating but is an **ortho-, para-director**.\n    *   Friedel-Crafts reactions, such as acylation (adding the -COCH3 group), fail on strongly deactivated rings, like those bearing a nitro group, or on rings with an amino group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    *   **Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n        This sequence begins with bromination, followed by nitration. The third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation, is attempted on a bromo-nitro-benzene ring. The presence of the deactivating nitro group makes this step non-viable.\n\n    *   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n        This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, which is then reduced to aniline (-NH2). The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring.\n\n    *   **Option D:** This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the group). This would return the molecule to benzene, which is not a productive synthesis route.\n\n    *   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n        1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This is a standard and effective first step. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n        2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This is a logical step.\n        3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. At this stage, the ring has a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho-, para-director (-Br). These groups have conflicting directing effects, which would typically lead to a mixture of products, thus not providing a \"high-yield\" of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one isomer.\n\n*   **Optimal Synthesis vs. Provided Options:**\n    The most efficient, high-yield synthesis would involve an order of reactions where the directing effects of the substituents are cooperative. This would be:\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The -COCH3 group directs meta).\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Both the -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are meta-directors and they cooperatively direct the bromine to the 5-position).\n\n    This optimal sequence is not listed as an option. However, when evaluating the given choices, options A, C, and D contain steps that are known to fail. Option B is the only sequence where the initial steps are chemically viable and lead towards the target molecule, even if the yield in the third step is compromised by competing directing effects. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) in the option are nonsensical for producing the final target and appear to be erroneous. By elimination of the unfeasible options, B remains the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
