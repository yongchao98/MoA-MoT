    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Energy Components**\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles.\n*   One particle (let's call it the central charge, `q_c`) is fixed at a point P.\n*   Twelve particles (let's call them sphere charges, `q_s`) are constrained on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m`, centered at P.\n*   All particles have the same charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of this isolated system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. This can be broken down into two main parts:\n*   **`U_interaction`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n*   **`U_sphere`**: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves.\n\nThe total minimum energy is `U_total = U_interaction + U_sphere`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Interaction Energy (`U_interaction`)**\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge `q` and any single charge `q` on the sphere is given by Coulomb's law: `U_pair = k * q^2 / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant.\n\nSince there are 12 such charges on the sphere, the total interaction energy is:\n`U_interaction = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n**3. Calculate the Sphere Energy (`U_sphere`)**\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy for the whole system, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their own mutual potential energy, `U_sphere`. This is a well-known problem called the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor 12 charges, the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when the charges are located at the vertices of a **regular icosahedron**.\n\nThe potential energy `U_sphere` is the sum of the potential energies for all pairs of charges on the sphere:\n`U_sphere = k * q^2 * Σ (1/r_ij)`, where the sum is over all unique pairs `(i, j)` of the 12 charges, and `r_ij` is the distance between them.\n\nFor an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R`, the 66 pairs of vertices have three distinct distances:\n*   30 pairs are separated by the edge length of the icosahedron, `d1`.\n*   30 pairs are separated by the short diagonal, `d2`.\n*   6 pairs are opposite vertices, separated by the diameter of the sphere, `d3 = 2R`.\n\nThe dimensionless energy for the N=12 Thomson problem is a known value, `E_12 = R * Σ (1/r_ij) ≈ 49.165`.\nTherefore, `Σ (1/r_ij) = E_12 / R`.\nSo, `U_sphere = k * q^2 * (E_12 / R)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (`U_total`)**\n\nNow, we combine the two energy components:\n`U_total = U_interaction + U_sphere`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (k * q^2 * E_12 / R)`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + E_12)`\n\n**5. Substitute the Values and Compute**\n\nLet's plug in the physical constants and given values:\n*   `k` (Coulomb's constant) ≈ `8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`\n*   `e` (elementary charge) ≈ `1.602177 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `q = 2e` ≈ `3.204354 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `q^2` ≈ `1.026788 × 10^-37 C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n*   `E_12` ≈ `49.165`\n\nFirst, calculate the term `k * q^2`:\n`k * q^2 ≈ (8.98755 × 10^9) * (1.026788 × 10^-37) ≈ 9.2285 × 10^-28 J⋅m`\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation for `U_total`:\n`U_total = ( (9.2285 × 10^-28 J⋅m) / 2 m ) * (12 + 49.165)`\n`U_total = (4.61425 × 10^-28 J) * (61.165)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82235 × 10^-26 J`\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nRounding the result to three decimal places gives `2.822 × 10^-26 J`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
