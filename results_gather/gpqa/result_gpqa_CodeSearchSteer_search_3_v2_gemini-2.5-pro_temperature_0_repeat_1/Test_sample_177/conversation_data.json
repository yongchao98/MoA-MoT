    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we will analyze the given Lagrangian interaction term \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Lagrangian\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action S is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over four-dimensional spacetime: S = ∫d⁴x L.\n\n*   The spacetime volume element d⁴x has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = -4.\n*   For the action S to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of [L] = 4.\n\nNow, let's determine the mass dimensions of the fields involved:\n\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\partial_\\mu] + [\\psi] = 4. Since the derivative \\partial_\\mu has a mass dimension of 1, and [\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi], we get 2[\\psi] + 1 = 4, which implies that the fermion field has a mass dimension of [ψ] = 3/2.\n*   **Field strength tensor (F<sup>μν</sup>):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have 2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4, which means the field strength tensor has a mass dimension of [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2.\n*   **Sigma tensor (σ<sub>μν</sub>):** The term \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right] is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} is dimensionless.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant κ\n\nThe interaction term \\mathcal{L}_{int} must also have a mass dimension of 4. We can write the dimensional equation for this term as:\n\n[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4\n\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n\n4 = [\\kappa] * (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) * (2) is incorrect. The dimensions add up.\n\nThe correct equation is:\n[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]\n\n4 = [\\kappa] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2\n\n4 = [\\kappa] + 3 + 2\n\n4 = [\\kappa] + 5\n\n[\\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ is -1.\n\n### 3. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining whether a theory is renormalizable by power-counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If all coupling constants have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero, the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if the dimension is strictly positive).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because interactions with negative mass dimension couplings become stronger at higher energies, leading to uncontrollable divergences in loop calculations.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining our findings:\n*   The mass dimension of κ is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
