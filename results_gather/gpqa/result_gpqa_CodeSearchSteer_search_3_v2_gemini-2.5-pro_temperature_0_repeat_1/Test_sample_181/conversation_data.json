    "The Mott-Gurney equation is a fundamental model used to describe the current-voltage relationship in a specific regime of semiconductor device operation. Its validity rests on several key assumptions about the device's properties and the nature of charge transport.\n\nAn analysis of the conditions required for the Mott-Gurney law reveals the following:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that the current is transported by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free Insulator:** The derivation presumes an ideal insulator or an intrinsic semiconductor with no charge-trapping states within its band gap. The presence of traps significantly alters the current-voltage characteristics.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts:** The equation requires the presence of an Ohmic contact at the charge-injecting electrode. This means the contact can supply an unlimited number of carriers, presenting no barrier to injection. A Schottky contact, which is rectifying, violates this condition.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current:** The model assumes that the current is primarily driven by the drift of carriers under the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current is considered negligible and is ignored in the derivation.\n\nBased on these points, we can evaluate the given statements:\n*   Statement A is incorrect because the law applies to single-carrier, not two-carrier, devices.\n*   Statement C is incorrect as it specifies a Schottky contact, whereas an Ohmic contact is required.\n*   Statement D is incorrect because the current is assumed to be dominated by drift, not negligible drift.\n*   Statement B correctly summarizes the main conditions: it is a single-carrier device, it is trap-free, it has a contact with no injection barrier (Ohmic), and the diffusion current is negligible.\n\n<<<B>>>"
