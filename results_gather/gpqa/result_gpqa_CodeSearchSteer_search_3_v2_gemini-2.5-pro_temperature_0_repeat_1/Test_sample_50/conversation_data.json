    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we use the method of images. The grounded conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge, which, together with the original charge `q`, creates a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**:\n    For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, an image charge `q'` is placed along the same line.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center of the sphere is `b = R²/d`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**:\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This is equivalent to the potential energy of the charge `q` due to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. However, the total electrostatic energy of the system is half the interaction energy between the charge and its image. This factor of 1/2 arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, which exists only in the space outside the sphere.\n\n3.  **Interaction Energy**:\n    First, let's calculate the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   The potential energy of interaction (`U_interaction`) between two point charges is given by `k * q1 * q2 / r`.\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Substituting the values for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        `U_interaction = - (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)`\n\n4.  **Net Potential Energy of the System**:\n    The net potential energy of the system is half of the interaction energy.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * [- (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
