    "The final answer is based on a step-by-step chemical deduction based on the information provided in the prompt.\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z:**\nThe problem states that hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is very close to 1/7 (≈ 14.2857%). For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CnHm, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately m / (12n + m). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives 7m = 12n + m, which simplifies to 6m = 12n, or m = 2n. The empirical formula is therefore CH2. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane. Since Z is described as a widely used solvent, the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y:**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. It does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. One component of Y is the hydrocarbon Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the other component Y2.\n\nThe prompt states that hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + Y2) yields only cyclohexane. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, this means that the hydrogenation of Y2 must yield cyclohexane. For Y2 to be part of a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine water, it must either be saturated or aromatic. If Y2 were saturated, it would have to be an isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) that converts to cyclohexane under severe hydrogenation conditions. However, a more elegant solution that fits the chemistry of disproportionation is that Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions but is readily hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X:**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that decolorizes bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated. The problem states they do not contain conjugated multiple bonds. When mixture X is heated with platinum, it undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene). This suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction:\nX1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n\nSince both X1 and X2 can be hydrogenated to form only cyclohexane, they must both possess a six-carbon ring skeleton. Let the formula of X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. From the balanced reaction, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved: a + b = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nWe are looking for two non-conjugated, unsaturated, six-carbon ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most common and logical candidates are:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n*   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** (The 1,3-isomer is conjugated and thus excluded).\n\nLet's check if this pair fits. The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent. The disproportionation reaction would be a transfer of two hydrogen atoms from cyclohexa-1,4-diene (which becomes benzene) to cyclohexene (which becomes cyclohexane). This is a known type of catalytic reaction.\n\nSo, the two liquids in mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**4. Calculation of Total Hydrogen Atoms:**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\nTotal H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
