    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, two conditions must be met: the star must be bright enough for both instruments, and it must be visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n\n### **Condition 1: Apparent Magnitude**\nA star's brightness as seen from Earth is its apparent magnitude (m). For an object to be detected by both instruments, it must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of the less sensitive instrument.\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17.\n*   **HIRES (Keck):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16.\n\nTherefore, for a star to be observable by **both**, it must have an apparent V magnitude **m_V < 16.0**.\n\n### **Condition 2: Sky Visibility (Declination)**\nA star's position in the celestial sphere, its declination (DEC), determines from which latitudes on Earth it is visible.\n*   **Paranal Observatory** is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. This allows it to observe stars with declinations south of about +65°.\n*   **Keck Observatory** is located at a latitude of about +19.8°. This allows it to observe stars with declinations north of about -70°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the overlapping range of **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n### **Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs (pc) using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5*log10(d/10). If there is interstellar extinction (A_V), it makes the star appear fainter, so the formula becomes m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10) + A_V.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** M_V = 15.5, d = 10 pc.\n        m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15.5. This is bright enough for both instruments (15.5 < 16.0).\n    *   **Position:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required visibility range for Keck.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** m_V = 16.5. This is too faint for HIRES (16.5 > 16.0).\n    *   **Position:** DEC = +55°. This is within the visibility range.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** The apparent V magnitude is given as m_V = 15.5. This is bright enough for both instruments (15.5 < 16.0). The additional information about color excess is not needed as the final apparent magnitude is provided.\n    *   **Position:** DEC = +48°. This is within the visibility range for both observatories.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** M_V = 15.5, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4.\n        First, calculate the extinction: A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        Then, calculate the apparent magnitude: m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 16.74. This is too faint for HIRES (16.74 > 16.0).\n    *   **Position:** DEC = -48°. This is within the visibility range.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** M_V = 16.5, d = 5 pc.\n        m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995. This is bright enough for both instruments (14.995 < 16.0).\n    *   **Position:** DEC = +60°. This is within the visibility range for both observatories.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the magnitude and declination requirements to be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<D>>>"
