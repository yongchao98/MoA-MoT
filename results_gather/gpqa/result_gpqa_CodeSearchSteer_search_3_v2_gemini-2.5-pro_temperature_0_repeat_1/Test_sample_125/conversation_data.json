    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave in the different HPLC systems.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from either face. This results in the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Separation:** Diastereomers have different physical properties (like polarity, boiling point, etc.) and can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques, including normal-phase HPLC.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the two ketones creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule, they are produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Analysis on HPLC Columns**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the racemic mixture of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers will elute as **one peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, eluting as a **separate, second peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C7 methoxy-alcohols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different polarities. Thus, the peaks from Reaction I will be well-separated from the peaks from Reaction II.\n\nCounting the peaks: 2 peaks from Reaction I + 2 peaks from Reaction II = **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I are chemically different and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The racemic mixture from Reaction II will be resolved by the chiral column. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral. It cannot be resolved into enantiomers and will elute as a **single peak**. As a diastereomer of the other products from Reaction II, it will have a unique retention time.\n\nCounting the peaks: 2 peaks from Reaction I + 3 peaks from Reaction II = **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
