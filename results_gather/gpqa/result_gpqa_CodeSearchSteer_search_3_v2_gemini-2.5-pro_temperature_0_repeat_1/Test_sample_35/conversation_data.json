    "### Calculating the Rest-Frame Energy\n\nThe first step is to determine the original energy of the absorption line before it was redshifted by the expansion of the universe. The observed energy is given as 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV) from a structure at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n\nTo find the rest-frame energy (E_rest), we must first determine the cosmological redshift (z) corresponding to a distance of 2.1 Gpc. Using standard cosmological models, a distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a redshift of approximately z ≈ 0.49.\n\nThe rest-frame energy can then be calculated using the formula:\n\n*E_rest = E_observed * (1 + z)*\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n*E_rest = (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49)*\n*E_rest ≈ 5.81 x 10⁻⁶ eV*\n\n### Identifying the Source in the Milky Way\n\nThe next step is to compare this calculated rest-frame energy with the known energy levels of transitions in the various components of the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM).\n\n*   **Cold and Warm Molecular Interstellar Medium:** The absorption and emission lines in molecular clouds are due to the rotational and vibrational transitions of molecules like carbon monoxide (CO). These transitions are in the millimeter and infrared wavelength ranges, corresponding to energies significantly higher than the calculated rest-frame energy. For instance, the most common CO transition has an energy of about 4.76 x 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n*   **Cold and Warm Atomic Interstellar Medium:** The atomic interstellar medium is primarily composed of neutral hydrogen (H I). Neutral hydrogen has a very specific, low-energy transition known as the 21-cm line or the hydrogen line. This line is produced by a spin-flip transition in the ground state of the hydrogen atom. The energy of this transition is approximately 5.87 x 10⁻⁶ eV (5.874 μeV).\n\nThis value is remarkably close to our calculated rest-frame energy of ~5.81 x 10⁻⁶ eV. The 21-cm line can be observed in both emission, typically from the warm atomic (or neutral) medium, and in absorption. Absorption lines, particularly narrow ones, are characteristic of colder, denser gas clouds situated in front of a brighter, warmer background source. Therefore, an absorption line at this energy is a strong indicator of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\nBased on the close match between the calculated rest-frame energy and the well-known energy of the 21-cm hydrogen line, the observed feature is most likely associated with the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<B>>>"
