    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow these steps.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star and are assumed to have the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\n### 2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by the planets, which can be related to the star's radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K). The Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity (v_r) according to the formula Δλ / λ = v_r / c, where c is the speed of light. Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n\nK1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the following relationship:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Determining the Semi-Major Axis Ratio\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\na ≈ G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1):\n\na2 / a1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (M_star * K2^2)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNext, substitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\n*   a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
