    "The search results confirm the use of the Boltzmann equation for determining the relative populations of energy levels in stellar atmospheres, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe standard form of the equation is:\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in energy states b and a.\n*   g_b and g_a are the degeneracies of the states.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This can be interpreted as the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (let's call it state 'i') relative to the total number of atoms (N_total) is twice as large for star 1.\n\n(N_i / N_total)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_total)_2\n\nIn many stellar atmospheres, it's a valid approximation to assume that most atoms are in the ground state (state 'g'), so N_total ≈ N_gnd. This simplifies the relationship to:\n\n(N_i / N_gnd)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_gnd)_2\n\nNow, we can apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:\n\nFor star_1: (N_i / N_gnd)_1 = (g_i / g_gnd) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\nFor star_2: (N_i / N_gnd)_2 = (g_i / g_gnd) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nSubstituting these into our ratio equation:\n(g_i / g_gnd) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_i / g_gnd) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe degeneracy term (g_i / g_gnd) cancels out:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nRearranging the terms to solve for 2:\n2 = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n2 = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T_1 - 1/T_2)]\n2 = exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nCombining the fractions in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1 K.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\nln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  The problem setup requires comparing the population of an excited state in two different stars.\n2.  The Boltzmann equation is the correct physical principle to use for populations of energy levels in a gas in LTE.\n3.  The interpretation of \"twice as excited\" as a ratio of the fractional population is standard.\n4.  The approximation that the ground state population is nearly equal to the total population is reasonable for this type of problem.\n5.  The algebraic manipulation is correct.\n6.  The numerical values of ΔE and k are deliberately chosen to make their ratio equal to 1.\n\nThe derivation robustly leads to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
