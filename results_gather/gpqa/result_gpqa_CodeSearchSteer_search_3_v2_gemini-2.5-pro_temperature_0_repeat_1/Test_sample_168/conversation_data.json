    "The process described is a nuclear decay that converts two nucleons of one flavor (neutrons) into two of another (protons), which is known as double beta decay.\n\n1.  **Original Decay:** The initial decay is described as 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. Here, A represents the parent nucleus and B the daughter nucleus. The emitted particles E are electrons (beta particles), and V are antineutrinos (ν). This is the standard two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ), a process allowed by the Standard Model of particle physics:\n    2n -> 2p + 2e⁻ + 2ν̅ₑ\n    The total energy released, known as the Q-value, is determined by the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei. This energy is shared among the four outgoing light particles (two electrons and two antineutrinos). Because the energy is distributed among multiple particles, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two electrons has a continuous spectrum, ranging from zero up to the Q-value. The endpoint of this spectrum is indeed Q.\n\n2.  **Variant Decay:** The variant decay is 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, where M is a single, exotic, massless particle. This type of decay is known as Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay. The particle M is a hypothetical Goldstone boson called the Majoron.\n\n3.  **Nature of the Spectrum:** In this variant decay, the final state contains three particles that share the available energy (the two electrons and the Majoron M). Whenever three or more particles are present in the final state of a decay, the energy distribution among them is continuous. Therefore, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two electrons will have a continuous spectrum. This eliminates options A and B, which state the spectrum becomes discrete. A discrete spectrum, a sharp peak, would only occur if there were only two bodies in the final state (the two electrons), as is the case in the standard neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ).\n\n4.  **Shape and Endpoint of the Spectrum:** The Q-value of the decay is determined by the initial and final nuclei (A and B) and remains the same for both the original and the variant decay. The endpoint of the electron energy spectrum is this Q-value. This occurs in the scenario where the other emitted particles (the two antineutrinos in the first case, or the one Majoron in the second) carry away zero energy. Thus, the true endpoint of the spectrum does not change.\n\n    However, the *shape* of the energy spectrum is altered. In the Majoron-emitting decay, there is one fewer particle in the final state compared to the two-neutrino decay. Kinetically, this means it is more probable for the electrons to carry away a larger fraction of the total decay energy. As a result, the peak of the energy spectrum for the Majoron-emitting decay is shifted to a higher energy compared to the peak of the two-neutrino double beta decay spectrum.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The spectrum remains continuous, and its shape is adjusted such that the average and most probable (peak) energies of the electrons are higher. Although the ultimate endpoint (Q-value) is the same, the significant shift of the spectral shape to higher energies is a key feature. Given the choices, the option stating the \"endpoint increases\" is the best description of this physical phenomenon, interpreting \"endpoint\" loosely as the characteristic energy or the peak of the spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the effective energy distribution is shifted to be higher.\n\n<<<D>>>"
