    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman-alpha wavelength, allowing for detection by optical ground-based telescopes, we must consider the atmospheric limitations of these telescopes and the redshift effect on the wavelength of light.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is largely opaque to UV radiation, primarily due to absorption by molecules like ozone. For a spectral line to be observable by a ground-based optical telescope, it must be redshifted into the optical window, the range of wavelengths that can penetrate the atmosphere.\n\nThe optical window for ground-based telescopes begins at approximately 4000 Å. Therefore, the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Å must be redshifted to at least this wavelength to be detected.\n\nThe redshift (z) is related to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) and the observed wavelength (λ_observed) by the following formula:\n\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we set λ_rest to 1216 Å and λ_observed to the minimum wavelength detectable from the ground, which is about 4000 Å.\n\n1 + z = 4000 Å / 1216 Å\n1 + z ≈ 3.29\nz ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculation provides an estimated lower limit for the redshift. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\nA) 2.4\nB) 1.2\nC) 3\nD) 1.9\n\nThe calculated redshift of approximately 2.29 is closest to option A, 2.4. A redshift of 1.9 would only shift the Lyman-alpha line to about 3526 Å (1216 Å * (1 + 1.9)), which is still largely absorbed by the atmosphere. A redshift of 3 would shift the line to 4864 Å, well within the observable range, but this is not the lower limit. Therefore, a redshift of about 2.4 represents the most plausible lower limit for these objects to be detectable with optical ground-based telescopes. Some sources indicate that for ground-based observation, the Lyman-alpha wavelength needs to be stretched by a factor of 3 to 5, corresponding to a redshift of 2 to 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
