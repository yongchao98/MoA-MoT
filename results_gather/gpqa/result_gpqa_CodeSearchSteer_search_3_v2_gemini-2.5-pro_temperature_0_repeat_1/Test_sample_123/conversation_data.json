    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, as it applies to particle decay. The fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after traveling a distance *d* is governed by the exponential decay law, which must account for the relativistic effects on the particle's lifetime.\n\nThe formula for the number of surviving particles is:\nN/N₀ = exp(-t / τ')\n\nWhere:\n*   N is the number of particles remaining.\n*   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n*   t is the time of flight in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n*   τ' is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is longer in the lab frame (τ') than its proper lifetime in its own rest frame (τ). This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ):\nτ' = γ * τ\n\nThe particles are traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities, so their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius, *R* = 30 m, is:\nt ≈ R / c\n\nBy substituting these relations into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\nN/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\nThe term (c * τ) represents the mean decay length of the particle in its own rest frame, which is a constant for this type of particle.\n\nWe can now apply the two given conditions to solve for the unknown Lorentz factor.\n\n**Condition 1:**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N/N₀) = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n*   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))\n\nTo solve for the unknown (c * τ), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)\n\n**Condition 2:**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N/N₀) = 2/3\n*   Radius (R) = 30 m\n*   The required Lorentz factor is γ₂.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can find the ratio between them to eliminate the (c * τ) term and solve for γ₂.\n\nDividing the equation from Condition 1 by the equation from Condition 2:\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = [1.5 / (c * τ)] / [30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)]\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 * γ₂) / 30\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\nγ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))]\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * [1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)]\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * [1.0986 / 0.4055]\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis result is very close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
