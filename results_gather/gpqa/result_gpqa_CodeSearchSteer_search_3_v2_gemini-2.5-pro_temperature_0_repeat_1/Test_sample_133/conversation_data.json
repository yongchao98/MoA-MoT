    "To accurately calculate the total enthalpy change, we must consider two separate exothermic processes occurring in the mixture: the neutralization of acids by the base, and the precipitation of barium sulfate.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Moles\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of the reactive ions provided by each solution.\n\n*   **H+ ions from 0.2 M HCl:**\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L * 0.500 L = 0.10 mol H+\n*   **H+ ions from 0.3 M H2SO4:**\n    *   H2SO4 is a strong acid that provides two H+ ions per molecule.\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L * 2 = 0.18 mol H+\n*   **Total moles of H+ ions:**\n    *   0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol H+\n*   **OH- ions from 0.5 M Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that provides two OH- ions per molecule.\n    *   Moles = 0.5 mol/L * 0.200 L * 2 = 0.20 mol OH-\n*   **Ba2+ ions from 0.5 M Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Moles = 0.5 mol/L * 0.200 L = 0.10 mol Ba2+\n*   **SO4^2- ions from 0.3 M H2SO4:**\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L = 0.09 mol SO4^2-\n\n### 2. Enthalpy of Neutralization\n\nThe neutralization reaction is between H+ and OH- ions to form water:\nH+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H2O(l)\n\n*   We have 0.28 moles of H+ and 0.20 moles of OH-. The limiting reactant is the hydroxide ion (OH-).\n*   Therefore, 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   **Heat released from neutralization:**\n    *   Enthalpy = 0.20 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\n### 3. Enthalpy of Precipitation\n\nA precipitation reaction occurs between Ba2+ and SO4^2- ions to form solid barium sulfate:\nBa2+(aq) + SO4^2-(aq) → BaSO4(s)\n\n*   We have 0.10 moles of Ba2+ and 0.09 moles of SO4^2-. The limiting reactant is the sulfate ion (SO4^2-).\n*   Therefore, 0.09 moles of BaSO4 precipitate will be formed.\n*   The standard enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO4 is approximately -4.5 kcal/mol (which is equivalent to about -18.8 kJ/mol, though values can vary slightly).\n*   **Heat released from precipitation:**\n    *   Enthalpy = 0.09 mol * (-4.5 kcal/mol) = -0.405 kcal\n\n### 4. Total Enthalpy Change\n\nThe total enthalpy of the reaction is the sum of the heat released from both the neutralization and precipitation reactions.\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy** = Enthalpy of Neutralization + Enthalpy of Precipitation\n*   Total Enthalpy = -2.74 kcal + (-0.405 kcal) = -3.145 kcal\n\nThis calculated value is not among the options. Let's re-evaluate the standard enthalpy values. The enthalpy of neutralization is often cited as -57.1 kJ/mol, which is -13.65 kcal/mol. Using this value:\n*   Heat from neutralization = 0.20 mol * (-13.65 kcal/mol) = -2.73 kcal.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option B. It is possible that the question simplifies the problem by only considering the heat of neutralization, as it is the major contributor to the total heat released. The heat from the precipitation of BaSO4 is significantly smaller. Given the options, the question likely expects the calculation to be based solely on the neutralization reaction.\n\nLet's proceed with the heat of neutralization as the primary component.\n\n*   **Moles of H+:** 0.28 mol\n*   **Moles of OH-:** 0.20 mol\n*   **Limiting reactant:** OH- (0.20 mol)\n*   **Heat of Neutralization:** The reaction between a strong acid and a strong base releases approximately 13.7 kcal per mole of water formed.\n*   **Total Heat Released:** 0.20 mol * 13.7 kcal/mol = 2.74 kcal\n\nSince heat is released, the enthalpy change is negative.\n**Enthalpy of Neutralization ≈ -2.74 kcal**\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
