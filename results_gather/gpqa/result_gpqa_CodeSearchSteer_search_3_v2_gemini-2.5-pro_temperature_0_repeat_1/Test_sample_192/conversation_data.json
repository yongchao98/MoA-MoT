    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.** Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) of a star. This can be expressed as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Use the given information.** The problem states that the number of stars (N) observed in a specific region varies with parallax according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance.** To find out how the number of stars changes with distance, we can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into the given equation. Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This equation tells us that the total number of stars up to a certain distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.** The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is equivalent to finding the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of N with respect to r (`dN/dr`).\n\n    Given `N ∝ r^5`, let's introduce a constant of proportionality, k:\n    `N = k * r^5`\n\n    Now, we differentiate N with respect to r:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n\n    This result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as `~ r^4`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
