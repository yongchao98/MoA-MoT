    "### Neutrino Flux Ratio Close to 0.01 After Hypothetical Halt of pp-III Branch\n\nIf the pp-III fusion branch in the Sun's core were to stop, the ratio of the neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV energy band to that in the 800-900 keV band would be approximately 0.01 (10⁻²). This is because the dominant source of neutrinos in the higher energy band would remain, while the primary sources in the lower band would be significantly diminished.\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several fusion reactions, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III), and the CNO cycle. Each reaction produces neutrinos with a characteristic energy spectrum.\n\nThe hypothetical scenario specifies that the pp-III branch stops. The key neutrino-producing reaction in this branch is the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B), which creates a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with energies up to about 15 MeV. The cessation of this branch means the flux of ⁸B neutrinos would disappear.\n\nAnalyzing the two energy bands in question:\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Under normal conditions, the neutrino flux in this range is a mix of neutrinos from the ⁸B continuum and the CNO cycle's ¹⁵O decay. With the ⁸B neutrinos gone, only the much smaller flux from the CNO cycle remains.\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band is overwhelmingly dominated by a very strong, sharp peak of neutrinos from the pp-II branch. Specifically, the electron capture by Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) produces a monoenergetic line of neutrinos at approximately 861 keV. This reaction is part of the pp-II branch and, per the problem's conditions, remains unaffected. While ⁸B and ¹⁵O neutrinos also contribute to this band, their flux is minuscule compared to the massive ⁷Be line.\n\nAfter the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the 800-900 keV band remains very high due to the persistent ⁷Be neutrinos. In contrast, the flux in the 700-800 keV band drops significantly, left with only the contribution from the CNO cycle.\n\nThe total flux of the main ⁷Be neutrino line is roughly ten times greater than the total flux of all ¹⁵O neutrinos. Furthermore, the ⁷Be flux is concentrated at a single energy within Band 2, while the ¹⁵O flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to 1.73 MeV). Consequently, the flux within the 100 keV-wide Band 1 is only a small fraction of the total ¹⁵O flux. This results in the flux in Band 2 being about 100 times larger than the flux in Band 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) is approximately 1/100, or 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
