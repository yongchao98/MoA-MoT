    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of Compound X from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid, where the broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nThe IR data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region (typically >10 ppm) is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicates a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, which is consistent with protons adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group like a carboxylic acid. The other doublet at 7.2 ppm is in a more typical aromatic region, suggesting it is adjacent to an alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Region Signals:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both a methyl and a methine group.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, shifted downfield, is characteristic of a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring).\n\nAssembling the alkyl fragment, the signals perfectly match a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]. Combining this with the aromatic and carboxylic acid portions, the structure of Compound X is determined to be **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to alkanes. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nThe aromatic ring and the *sec*-butyl group are not affected by these reaction conditions. The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
