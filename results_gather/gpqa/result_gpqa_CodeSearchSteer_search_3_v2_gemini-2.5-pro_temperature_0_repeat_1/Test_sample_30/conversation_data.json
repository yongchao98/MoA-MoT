    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### Step 1: Toluene to Product 1\n\nToluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically, the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the toluene ring is an ortho-, para-director. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. However, under conditions that favor dinitration, 2,4-dinitrotoluene is the major product. Given the subsequent reaction steps, it is plausible that the conditions are set for dinitration. Therefore, **Product 1 is 2,4-dinitrotoluene**.\n\n### Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (2,4-dinitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This set of reagents is used for the oxidation of a methyl group on an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid. The nitro groups deactivate the ring towards electrophilic attack, which helps to achieve a good yield for the oxidation of the methyl group. Thus, the methyl group of 2,4-dinitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. **Product 2 is 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. This reaction is a variation of the Janovsky reaction. First, the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts with the sodium hydroxide base. Then, in the presence of a strong base, acetone forms an enolate ion. This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electron-deficient aromatic ring. The two nitro groups strongly withdraw electron density, making the ring susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The attack occurs at the position ortho to both nitro groups (position 3), which is the most electrophilic site. This addition forms a Meisenheimer complex, which is a stable, colored species. In this specific case, the reaction leads to the formation of a bicyclic compound. The carboxylate group attacks the carbonyl carbon of the attached acetone moiety in an intramolecular aldol-type condensation. This results in the formation of a six-membered ring fused to the original benzene ring. **Product 3 is a bicyclic enolate salt**.\n\nThe structure of Product 3 is a planar fused ring system. To determine its molecular symmetry, we analyze its symmetry elements:\n*   **Plane of symmetry (σ):** The molecule is planar, so the molecular plane itself is a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Center of inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Rotation axes (Cₙ):** The molecule does not possess any rotation axes other than the trivial C₁ axis.\n\nA molecule that has only a plane of symmetry (and the identity element E) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<A>>>"
