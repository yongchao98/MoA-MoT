    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate the mole fraction of this species relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy substituting these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration, we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = ( β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100\n\nThe term [Co²⁺] cancels out, so the total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M is not needed for this specific calculation. We can now substitute the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it D):\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of the numerator term for our complex of interest (β₂[SCN⁻]²):\nNumerator = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage:\nPercentage = (0.4 / 2.3646) × 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
