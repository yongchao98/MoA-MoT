    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two different reducing agents. The starting material in all options is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid, meaning it has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The key is how each reducing agent interacts with these two functional groups.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n*   **Reagents**: `LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup (`H+`).\n*   **Product**: `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (an R-lactone).\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH4**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  Starting material A, which has both a carboxylic acid and an ester group, is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  The LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester functional group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    3.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed hydroxyl group and the existing carboxylic acid group to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at the C3 position (which becomes the C4 position in the lactone product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product must be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material. Since the product is the (R)-lactone, starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n*   **Reagents**: `BH3` (Borane) followed by an acidic workup (`H+`).\n*   **Product**: `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (an S-lactone).\n*   **Selectivity of BH3**: Borane is also a selective reducing agent, but its preference is opposite to that of LiBH4. Borane is commonly used for the selective reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  Starting material B, with its carboxylic acid and ester groups, is treated with BH3.\n    2.  The BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid functional group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    3.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-ester.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, displacing isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction pathway also does not affect the original stereocenter at the C3 position. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is determined by the starting material. Since the product is the (S)-lactone, starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer to produce the (R)-lactone.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer to produce the (S)-lactone.\n\nThis corresponds to the following selection:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<B>>>"
