    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are interested in the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe problem starts with a stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that forms from the dissociation of the complex at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be (0.02 - x) M.\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the dissociation of the complex is very small. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). This allows us to simplify the equation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe simplified expression becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³ M²\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) M\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This confirms that our initial assumption (x << 0.02) was valid.\n\nThe problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which simplifies the calculation by allowing the direct use of the given formation constant. In reality, the stability of the complex is pH-dependent.\n\n<<<A>>>"
