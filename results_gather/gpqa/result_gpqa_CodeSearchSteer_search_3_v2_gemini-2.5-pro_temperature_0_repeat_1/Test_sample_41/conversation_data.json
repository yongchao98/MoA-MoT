    "The search results confirm the fundamental principles I used.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to the distance from its star (which is the semi-major axis 'a' for a circular orbit). The search results show that the energy received by a planet follows an inverse square law with distance. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq ∝ (1/D^2)^(1/4) ∝ (1/a)^(1/2), where D is the distance. This confirms my initial formula: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2). The problem states the albedo is the same for all planets, which is why it cancels out.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The search results unanimously state that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit (P² ∝ a³). This confirms the relationship I used: (P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³.\n\nThe steps and calculations are correct. The extra information about the TTV method and planet masses is indeed extraneous to solving this specific problem.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n1.  From the temperature ratios, find the ratios of the semi-major axes.\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = 1.4  => a2 / a1 = 1.4² = 1.96\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = (a3 / a2)^(1/2) = 2.3  => a3 / a2 = 2.3² = 5.29\n\n2.  Combine the ratios to find a3 / a1.\n    *   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods.\n    *   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n    *   P3 / P1 ≈ 33.3856\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nThe result matches option C. I am ready to provide the final answer.To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Semi-Major Axis:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. This energy is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance from the star (the semi-major axis, 'a'). The temperature is related to this energy, and the formula for equilibrium temperature, assuming the same star and albedo for all planets, simplifies to show that temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (T_eq ∝ 1/√a).\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets is related to the ratio of their semi-major axes as follows:\n    T_eq_x / T_eq_y = (a_y / a_x)^(1/2)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratios of the Semi-Major Axes:** We are given the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\n    Using the relationship from step 1, we can find the ratios of the semi-major axes:\n    *   For Planet1 and Planet2: (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = 1.4  => a2 / a1 = 1.4² = 1.96\n    *   For Planet2 and Planet3: (a3 / a2)^(1/2) = 2.3  => a3 / a2 = 2.3² = 5.29\n\n3.  **Determine the Overall Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** To find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1, we first need the ratio of their semi-major axes (a3 / a1). We can find this by multiplying the individual ratios:\n    *   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a³). This can be written as P² ∝ a³.\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1, we use this law:\n    *   (P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³\n    *   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Factor:** Now, we substitute the value of a3 / a1 that we calculated:\n    *   P3 / P1 ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.39\n\nThis result is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the TTV discovery method, the planets' mass ratios, and the specific albedo value (as long as it's consistent for all three planets) is not required for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
