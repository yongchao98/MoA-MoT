    "To solve this problem, a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound is necessary. The molecular formula for all compounds is C10H14. The spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 integration ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Analysis of Each Compound's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and would produce a single signal. The four methyl groups are also equivalent, resulting in another single signal.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 2 singlets (6H each, for a 1:1 ratio)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** The two aromatic protons are in different chemical environments, as are the methyl groups. The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, but the methyls at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 2 singlets (1H each, for a 1:1 ratio)\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 3 singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H or 2:1:1 ratio)\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, and each will show an ethyl quartet-triplet pattern.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1 singlet (4H)\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H), not singlets\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options:\n\nThe observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture has two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-). This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** The presence of 1,4-diethylbenzene would introduce a quartet and a triplet, which contradicts the observation of only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This combination would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-). This does not match.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only pair of compounds that would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
