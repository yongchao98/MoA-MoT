Since the stars are treated as black bodies, the solution requires three physical laws:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** L = 4πR²σT⁴. This gives the luminosity ratio: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This relates temperature to the *emitted* peak wavelength. The temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c). This relates the *observed* wavelength to the *emitted* wavelength.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    Therefore, the radius term in the luminosity ratio is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:** This is the most critical step and where most errors could occur.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This means their **observed** peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star 1, with a radial velocity of 0, there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can equate the expressions: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Combine and Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the radius and temperature terms into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁/L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 300,000 km/s (speed of light)\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23. Looking at the provided options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature relates to the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the necessary link.\n*   **Ignoring the Doppler Effect:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option D), ignoring the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation and serves only as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The luminosity ratio depends on the radius ratio squared (R₁/R₂)² and the temperature ratio to the fourth power (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at the same numerical result (~2.229). The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their prompts. The calculation itself is robustly in agreement.\n\nThe final answer is unequivocally the value closest to 2.229.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers and identifying the crucial points for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Relevant Physics:** The core task is to determine the luminosity ratio (L₁/L₂) between two stars. The problem assumes they behave as black bodies, which requires three key physical principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** Defines the luminosity of a black body as L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio is therefore L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** Relates a black body's temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted), where T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Connects the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength based on the source's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). The radius term in the luminosity ratio is therefore:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This is the most complex part, where the distinction between observed and emitted wavelength is crucial.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to find the ratio of the *emitted* wavelengths, which determines the temperature ratio.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0 km/s), there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s), the light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the equations equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we need the wavelength ratio λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Combine and Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the radius and temperature terms back into the Stefan-Boltzmann ratio formula:\n    L₁/L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values, using c ≈ 300,000 km/s for the speed of light:\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~2.23\n    *   B) ~2.35\n    *   C) ~2.25\n    *   D) ~2.32\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most critical point, as identified by nearly all candidate answers, is distinguishing between the *observed* peak wavelength (\"appeared brightest\") and the *emitted* peak wavelength (used in Wien's Law). The Doppler effect is the essential link between the two.\n*   **Ignoring the Doppler Effect:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). This incorrect assumption ignores the provided velocity data and leads to the wrong answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25, which is option C.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is irrelevant for a problem based on black body radiation principles (luminosity, radius, temperature) and should be ignored.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember that the radius ratio is squared (²) while the temperature ratio is raised to the fourth (⁴) power in the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identify the physics and perform the calculation to arrive at ~2.229. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (e.g., A, B, C, D) appear to stem from inconsistent labeling of the options within their individual responses, but the numerical conclusion is unanimous. Based on the prompt's option list, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem by synthesizing the provided analyses.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **Establish the Foundational Formula:** The Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation states that luminosity (L) is proportional to the square of the radius (R) and the fourth power of the surface temperature (T). This gives us the core formula for the ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of our equation is straightforward:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most critical step and requires combining two other physical laws, as correctly identified by the majority of the agents.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). This means T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion. We are given λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂. The Doppler formula connects the observed and emitted wavelengths: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n    *   **Combining the Laws:**\n        *   For Star_1, with zero radial velocity (v₁ = 0), there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, with a radial velocity of v₂ = 700 km/s, its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can equate the expressions: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Rearranging this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** I will now substitute the derived radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula and use Python to calculate the precise numerical result.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature relates to the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the necessary link between them.\n*   **Ignoring the Doppler Effect:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option A), ignoring the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation and serves only as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponent:** The temperature ratio must be raised to the fourth power in the final luminosity calculation, as dictated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given values and physical constants.\n# The ratio of the radius of Star_1 to Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s.\nv2_kms = 700\n# The speed of light in km/s.\nc_kms = 299792.458\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio (T1 / T2).\n# As derived from the Doppler effect and Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is:\n# T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\n# This is because Star 2 is moving away, so its light is redshifted.\n# For the observed peak wavelength to be the same as stationary Star 1,\n# Star 2 must be intrinsically hotter (emitting at a shorter wavelength).\n# This means T2 > T1, so the T1/T2 ratio must be less than 1.\ntemperature_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2_kms / c_kms)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final luminosity ratio (L1 / L2).\n# The formula is L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * (temperature_ratio**4)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and compare it to the given options.\nprint(f\"The calculated luminosity ratio is: {luminosity_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe options are:\")\nprint(\"A) ~2.25\")\nprint(\"B) ~2.32\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.35\")\nprint(\"D) ~2.23\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of ~2.2291 is closest to 2.23.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the correct option is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated luminosity ratio is: 2.2291\n\nThe options are:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.2291 is closest to 2.23.\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Relevant Physics:**\n    The goal is to find the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂ for two stars treated as black bodies.

Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Principles\nThe goal is to find the ratio of luminosities, L₁/L₂, for two stars. The solution requires combining three core principles of physics:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on its radius, R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). This means the temperature ratio is related to the emitted wavelength ratio as follows:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted if the source is moving relative to the observer. The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂). The Doppler formula connects the observed and emitted wavelengths for non-relativistic speeds:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information\n*   **Radius Ratio:** R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n*   **Velocity Data:** v_r,₁ = 0 km/s and v_r,₂ = 700 km/s. This information is crucial and must be used.\n*   **Wavelength Data:** The observed peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation principles and serves as a distractor.\n\n### 3. Synthesize the Principles to Find the Temperature Ratio\nThis is the most critical part of the problem, where the distinction between observed and emitted wavelength is key.\n\n1.  Use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths for each star:\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0): There is no Doppler shift, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s): The light is redshifted, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n2.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n3.  Now, use this relationship to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for Wien's Law:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n4.  Since T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity ratio formula. The Python code executed in the previous step confirmed the calculation.\n\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\n### 5.

We must compare this to the given options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature relates to the *emitted* wavelength.

This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option A). The problem is specifically designed to test the application of the Doppler shift.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio is irrelevant to this problem.\n\nThe correct calculation, which properly accounts for all relevant information, yields a result that rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and a list of crucial points to consider for the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to compute the luminosity ratio of two stars, L₁ / L₂, based on the given physical properties.\n\n2.  **Establish the Foundational Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star treated as a black body is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is therefore:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Squaring this ratio gives the first part of our equation:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step):** This step requires combining Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler Effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion. Thus, λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.

Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Principles\nThe main objective is to calculate the luminosity ratio, L₁ / L₂, of two stars. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, which requires the application of three fundamental laws of physics:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law gives the total luminosity (L) of a black body based on its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio of luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a black body's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). The temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the motion of a source affects the wavelength of light we *observe* (λ_obs). It connects the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength. For a source moving with radial velocity (v_r), the formula is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information and List Careful Points\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first term in our luminosity ratio is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not used in the laws of black body radiation for luminosity. This information is a distractor and should be ignored.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength.** This is the most critical part of the problem. The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), not the intrinsic or *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) which is used in Wien's Law. Therefore, λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Role of Velocity Data.** The radial velocities (v_r,₁ = 0 km/s and v_r,₂ = 700 km/s) are essential. They are the key to linking the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths via the Doppler effect. Ignoring this data leads to an incorrect answer.\n\n### 3.

The ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: A star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* (λ_emitted). The temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted from the emitted wavelength due to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n### Step 2: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Radius Ratio Term**: The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first term in the luminosity ratio is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n2.  **Temperature Ratio Term (The Critical Step)**:\n    *   The problem states the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths, which determine the temperature.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0): λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can equate the expressions:\n        λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths from Wien's Law (T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation above gives:\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n3.  **Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation**: Substitute the terms back into the Stefan-Boltzmann ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the provided values:\n    *   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 300,000 km/s (speed of light)\n    *   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n### Step 3: Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength**: The crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature relates to the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the necessary link.\n*   **Ignoring the Doppler Effect**: A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option A), ignoring the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation and serves only as a distractor.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the value 2.23.

This requires three core principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** Defines the luminosity (L) of a black body as L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio of luminosities is therefore L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** Relates a black body's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted), where T is inversely proportional to λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Connects the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) based on the source's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). The radius term in the luminosity ratio is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):**\n    This is the most complex part and where mistakes are most likely.\n    *   The problem states the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to find the ratio of the **emitted** wavelengths, which determines the temperature ratio.\n    *   For Star_1, v_r,₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we need the wavelength ratio λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Combine Terms and Perform Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁/L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values:\n    *   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value is ~2.229.

The radial velocity data is essential to connect the two.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common mistake is to ignore the Doppler effect. If one assumes that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂), the luminosity ratio would simply be (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25. This corresponds to option D and is incorrect because it ignores the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to a calculation based on black-body radiation principles and should be ignored as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The radius ratio must be squared, and the temperature ratio must be raised to the fourth power, as dictated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the correct analyses is that the Doppler effect must be accounted for, leading to a final answer of approximately 2.229, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the consensus from the provided answers and highlighting the critical points required for the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Relevant Physics:**\n    The primary goal is to compute the luminosity ratio, L₁ / L₂, for two stars assumed to be black-body radiators.

The problem assumes they behave as black bodies, which requires three key physical principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** Defines the luminosity of a black body as L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio is therefore L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** Relates a black body's temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted), where T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Connects the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength based on the source's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). The radius term in the luminosity ratio is therefore:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This is the most complex part, where the distinction between observed and emitted wavelength is crucial.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to find the ratio of the *emitted* wavelengths, which determines the temperature ratio.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0 km/s), there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s), the light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the equations equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we need the wavelength ratio λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Combine and Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the radius and temperature terms back into the Stefan-Boltzmann ratio formula:\n    L₁/L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values, using c ≈ 300,000 km/s for the speed of light:\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

The Doppler effect is the essential link between the two.\n*   **Ignoring the Doppler Effect:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). This incorrect assumption ignores the provided velocity data and leads to the wrong answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25, which is option C.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is irrelevant for a problem based on black body radiation principles (luminosity, radius, temperature) and should be ignored.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember that the radius ratio is squared (²) while the temperature ratio is raised to the fourth (⁴) power in the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identify the physics and perform the calculation to arrive at ~2.229.

This gives us the core formula for the ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of our equation is straightforward:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most critical step and requires combining two other physical laws, as correctly identified by the majority of the agents.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). This means T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion. We are given λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂. The Doppler formula connects the observed and emitted wavelengths: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n    *   **Combining the Laws:**\n        *   For Star_1, with zero radial velocity (v₁ = 0), there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, with a radial velocity of v₂ = 700 km/s, its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can equate the expressions: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Rearranging this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** I will now substitute the derived radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula and use Python to calculate the precise numerical result.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature relates to the *emitted* wavelength.

Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Principles\nThe goal is to find the ratio of luminosities, L₁/L₂, for two stars. The solution requires combining three core principles of physics:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on its radius, R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). This means the temperature ratio is related to the emitted wavelength ratio as follows:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted if the source is moving relative to the observer. The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂). The Doppler formula connects the observed and emitted wavelengths for non-relativistic speeds:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information\n*   **Radius Ratio:** R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n*   **Velocity Data:** v_r,₁ = 0 km/s and v_r,₂ = 700 km/s. This information is crucial and must be used.\n*   **Wavelength Data:** The observed peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation principles and serves as a distractor.\n\n### 3. Synthesize the Principles to Find the Temperature Ratio\nThis is the most critical part of the problem, where the distinction between observed and emitted wavelength is key.\n\n1.  Use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths for each star:\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0): There is no Doppler shift, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s): The light is redshifted, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n2.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n3.  Now, use this relationship to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for Wien's Law:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n4.  Since T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity ratio formula. The Python code executed in the previous step confirmed the calculation.\n\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\n### 5.

The ratio is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: Relates a star's temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted), where T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: Connects the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength based on radial velocity (v_r), where λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term**: The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.

Thus, its observed wavelength is its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s), its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is related to its emitted wavelength by: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can equate the expressions: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n\n4.  **Combine and Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**: Substitute the radius and temperature terms back into the Stefan-Boltzmann ratio:\n    L₁/L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value is ~2.229.

Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Principles\nThe main objective is to calculate the luminosity ratio, L₁ / L₂, of two stars. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, which requires the application of three fundamental laws of physics:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law gives the total luminosity (L) of a black body based on its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio of luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a black body's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). The temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the motion of a source affects the wavelength of light we *observe* (λ_obs). It connects the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength. For a source moving with radial velocity (v_r), the formula is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information and List Careful Points\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first term in our luminosity ratio is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not used in the laws of black body radiation for luminosity. This information is a distractor and should be ignored.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength.** This is the most critical part of the problem. The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), not the intrinsic or *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) which is used in Wien's Law. Therefore, λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Role of Velocity Data.** The radial velocities (v_r,₁ = 0 km/s and v_r,₂ = 700 km/s) are essential. They are the key to linking the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths via the Doppler effect. Ignoring this data leads to an incorrect answer.\n\n### 3.

The answer of 2.25 would only be correct if the Doppler effect from Star 2's velocity were ignored. The problem is specifically designed to test the combined application of all three physical laws.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesis of the Correct Method\n\nAll the candidate answers that arrive at the correct numerical result follow the same logical path, which involves three key physical principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius squared (R²) and its temperature to the fourth power (T⁴). The ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: A star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* (λ_emitted). The temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted from the emitted wavelength due to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n### Step 2: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Radius Ratio Term**: The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first term in the luminosity ratio is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n2.  **Temperature Ratio Term (The Critical Step)**:\n    *   The problem states the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths, which determine the temperature.\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0): λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can equate the expressions:\n        λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths from Wien's Law (T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation above gives:\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n3.  **Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation**: Substitute the terms back into the Stefan-Boltzmann ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the provided values:\n    *   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 300,000 km/s (speed of light)\n    *   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n### Step 3: Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength**: The crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature relates to the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the necessary link.\n*   **Ignoring the Doppler Effect**: A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option A), ignoring the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation and serves only as a distractor.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the value 2.23.

This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Connects the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) based on the source's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). The radius term in the luminosity ratio is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):**\n    This is the most complex part and where mistakes are most likely.\n    *   The problem states the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to find the ratio of the **emitted** wavelengths, which determines the temperature ratio.\n    *   For Star_1, v_r,₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we need the wavelength ratio λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Combine Terms and Perform Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁/L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values:\n    *   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁/L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated value is ~2.229. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    *   A) ~2.32\n    *   B) ~2.23\n    *   C) ~2.35\n    *   D) ~2.25\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most crucial point is distinguishing between the \"observed\" peak wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the \"emitted\" peak wavelength (which is used in Wien's Law to determine temperature). The radial velocity data is essential to connect the two.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common mistake is to ignore the Doppler effect. If one assumes that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂), the luminosity ratio would simply be (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25. This corresponds to option D and is incorrect because it ignores the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to a calculation based on black-body radiation principles and should be ignored as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The radius ratio must be squared, and the temperature ratio must be raised to the fourth power, as dictated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the correct analyses is that the Doppler effect must be accounted for, leading to a final answer of approximately 2.229, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the consensus from the provided answers and highlighting the critical points required for the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Relevant Physics:**\n    The primary goal is to compute the luminosity ratio, L₁ / L₂, for two stars assumed to be black-body radiators. This requires combining three fundamental principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** Provides the formula for luminosity, L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** Relates a star's temperature to its intrinsic (emitted) peak wavelength, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Connects the intrinsic wavelength (λ_emitted) to the observed wavelength (λ_obs) based on the star's radial velocity, λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    After canceling the constants (4, π, σ), the formula simplifies to:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Radius Term:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, the radius term is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):**\n    This step requires careful distinction between observed and emitted wavelengths.\n    *   According to Wien's Law, the temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the *emitted* wavelengths: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This crucial wording refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, meaning **λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂**.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths for each star.\n        *   For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0, there is no Doppler shift: **λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁**.\n        *   For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted: **λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n        λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need to rearrange this equation to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we substitute the derived radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values:\n    *   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    **L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most critical point is understanding that the problem gives information about the *observed* peak wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature requires the *emitted* (or intrinsic) peak wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential link between these two quantities.\n*   **Ignoring Velocity Data:** A common mistake is to see that the observed wavelengths are the same and incorrectly assume the temperatures are also the same (T₁ = T₂). This ignores the provided velocity data for Star_2 and leads to the incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option B). The problem is specifically designed to test the application of the Doppler shift.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is irrelevant for a calculation based on black-body radiation principles (which relate luminosity, radius, and temperature) and serves only as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember the correct powers from the Stefan-Boltzmann law: the radius ratio is squared, and the temperature ratio is raised to the fourth power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation, which correctly incorporates the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Law, and the Doppler Effect, yields a luminosity ratio of approximately 2.229. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) ~2.32\n*   B) ~2.25\n*   C) ~2.23\n*   D) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles re-evaluation of the problem, the correct approach involves synthesizing the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler Effect.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula**: The Stefan-Boltzmann law dictates that a star's luminosity (L) is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Term**: The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the radius term is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n3.  **Temperature Term**: This is the most critical part of the problem and requires careful distinction between observed and emitted properties.\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates temperature to the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted): T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.
