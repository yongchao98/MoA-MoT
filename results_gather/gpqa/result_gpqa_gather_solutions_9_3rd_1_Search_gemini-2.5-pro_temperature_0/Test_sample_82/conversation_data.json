The process involves three main stages: calculating the effect of the initial dilution, finding the pH in the buffer region (25% titration), and finding the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Initial Dilution Calculation**\nThis is a critical first step. The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. We must calculate the new concentration of the acid before the titration begins.\n*   **Formula:** M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n*   The solution being titrated is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**\nAt this point, 25% of the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base, creating a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the correct tool for this calculation.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   **Calculate pKa:** First, we find the pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Determine the Ratio:** At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and thus concentration) of the conjugate base [A⁻] to the acid [HA] is 25% to 75%, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   **Calculate Moles of Acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Calculate Volume of NaOH Added:** At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Calculate Concentration of Acetate:** The total volume is the sum of the diluted acid and the added NaOH.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Calculate pH from Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Calculate [OH⁻] using the approximation [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]).\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 4.26; 8.52\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.73; 7.00\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, with careful attention to the points where errors can occur.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: This is a critical first step. The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. This doubles the volume to 40.00 cm³ and halves the concentration.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   New volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n    *   New concentration of acetic acid = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\n    This is the concentration of the acid that is actually being titrated.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**: At this point, 25% of the acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming the conjugate base (acetate), while 75% of the acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.\n    *   The correct formula is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n    *   The pKa must be calculated from the given Ka: pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   The ratio of [conjugate base] to [acid] is 25% to 75%, which simplifies to 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ **4.256**. Rounded to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n    *   **Volume Calculation**: First, we need the total volume. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize 0.001 mol of acid is: Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³. The total volume is 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\n    *   **Concentration of Acetate**: The concentration of the acetate ion is the initial moles of acid (0.001 mol) divided by the total volume at the equivalence point (50.00 cm³ or 0.0500 L): [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n    *   **Hydrolysis Calculation**: The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression Kb = [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻], we can solve for [OH⁻]: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   **Final pH**: From [OH⁻], we find pOH = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483. Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ **8.517**. Rounded to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculations consistently show that the pH at 25% titration is **4.26** and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nA review of the candidate answers reveals that nearly all of them performed the chemical calculations correctly. However, many failed to match their correct numerical results to the correct lettered option from the original question.\n\nThe calculated values (4.26; 8.52) correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this titration problem by breaking it down into its core components. I will first verify the calculations performed by the agents to ensure the numerical results are correct. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: I will calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. This is a crucial first step.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve. I will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`, to find the pH. I'll need to calculate the pKa from the given Ka and determine the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid.\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base. I will calculate the concentration of the conjugate base, find its Kb value, and then calculate the resulting [OH⁻] concentration to determine the pOH and finally the pH.\n4.  **Final Comparison**: I will compare the two calculated pH values with the provided options (A, B, C, D) to determine the correct answer.\n\nI will implement these steps in a Python script to ensure precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_titration_ph():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the titration problem by calculating pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given constants and initial values ---\n    initial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\n    initial_vol_acid_cm3 = 20.00\n    vol_water_cm3 = 20.00\n    conc_naoh = 0.1  # M\n    Ka_acid = 1.85e-5\n    Kw = 1.0e-14\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution ---\n    # Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2\n    final_vol_acid_cm3 = initial_vol_acid_cm3 + vol_water_cm3\n    final_conc_acid = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid_cm3) / final_vol_acid_cm3\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration ---\n    # This is a buffer region, so we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    # pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n    pKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n    \n    # At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\n    ratio_base_acid = 1 / 3\n    ph_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_base_acid)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point ---\n    # First, find the initial moles of acid\n    initial_moles_acid = final_conc_acid * (final_vol_acid_cm3 / 1000)\n    \n    # At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = initial moles of acid\n    # Calculate the volume of NaOH needed\n    vol_naoh_eq_L = initial_moles_acid / conc_naoh\n    \n    # Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point\n    total_vol_eq_L = (final_vol_acid_cm3 / 1000) + vol_naoh_eq_L\n    \n    # Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate)\n    conc_acetate = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n    \n    # Calculate Kb for the conjugate base from Ka and Kw\n    Kb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\n    \n    # Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of the weak base: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [Acetate]\n    # We assume [OH-] is small, so the change in [Acetate] is negligible.\n    conc_oh = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n    \n    # Calculate pOH and then pH\n    pOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_oh)\n    ph_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the results and compare with options ---\n    print(f\"The calculated pH at 25% titration is: {ph_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The calculated pH at the equivalence point is: {ph_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\n    print(f\"A) 4.57; 6.92\")\n    print(f\"B) 4.26; 8.52\")\n    print(f\"C) 3.17; 6.73\")\n    print(f\"D) 4.73; 7.00\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe calculated values match option B.\")\n\ncalculate_titration_ph()\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 67\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Dilution:** The first step is a dilution. The initial concentration of acetic acid is not the concentration used in the titration. We must calculate the new concentration after adding water.\n*   **25% Titration Point:** This is a point in the buffer region. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the correct tool. The ratio of conjugate base to acid is key here.\n*   **Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate weak base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base, not by simple neutralization (pH will not be 7.00). The total volume of the solution changes, which affects the concentration of the conjugate base.\n*   **Constants:** We need Ka for the acid, and from it, we can derive pKa. For the equivalence point, we need Kb for the conjugate base, which is derived from Ka and Kw (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   We use the dilution formula: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Concentration (M₂) = (M₁ × V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**.\n*   This is the concentration of the acetic acid solution that is being titrated.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At this point, the solution is a buffer. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains. The ratio [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   First, find the initial moles of acid:\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize this amount of acid:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   Now, calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate (A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻). We need Kb:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Use the equilibrium expression for the weak base to find [OH⁻]:\n    Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.73; 7.00\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer. The core of the problem is to calculate the pH at two distinct points in a weak acid-strong base titration.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: This is the first critical step. The initial acetic acid solution is diluted before the titration begins.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid: `Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol`.\n    *   The final volume after adding water is `20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³` or `0.04000 L`.\n    *   The new concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is `Moles / Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M`.\n    *   All candidate answers correctly perform this step.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**: At this point, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains.

The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n    *   **Volume and Concentration at Equivalence**:\n        *   We need to add `0.001 mol` of NaOH to neutralize the `0.001 mol` of acid. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required is `Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L` or `10.00 cm³`.\n        *   The total volume of the solution is now `40.00 cm³` (diluted acid) + `10.00 cm³` (NaOH) = `50.00 cm³` or `0.0500 L`.\n        *   The concentration of the acetate ion is `[CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M`.\n    *   **Hydrolysis Calculation**: The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: `CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻`.\n        *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰`.\n        *   We can find the hydroxide concentration using the approximation `[OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻])`.\n        *   `[OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M`.\n    *   **Final pH Calculation**:\n        *   `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483`.\n        *   `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517`.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step calculation yields the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing these results to the provided options:\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.57; 6.92\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values match option D. While many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly, several made an error in matching their result to the correct lettered option. The chemical calculation is robust and consistently points to the values in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, including all the careful points required for an accurate solution.\n\n### **Analysis of the Calculation Steps**\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation for a weak acid-strong base titration. All candidate answers correctly identify the necessary steps, but some fail in the final matching of the result to the options. The consensus on the calculation methodology is strong and correct.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Initial Dilution**\nThe first and most crucial step is to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water. Forgetting this step is a common mistake.\n*   Initial Moles of Acetic Acid = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Final Volume after Dilution = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n*   New Concentration of Acetic Acid = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\nThis is the concentration that must be used for all subsequent titration calculations.\n\n**Careful Point 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**\nAt 25% titration, the solution contains a mixture of the unreacted weak acid (75%) and its newly formed conjugate base (25%). This is a classic buffer solution, and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct way to find the pH.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   **pKa Calculation:** pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n*   **Ratio:** The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:** pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n*   Rounded to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base (acetate). The pH is not neutral (7.00) because this conjugate base hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n*   **Total Volume:** First, calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize 0.001 mol of acid: Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L (10.00 cm³).

I will solve it by breaking it down into three main steps: calculating the initial concentration after dilution, calculating the pH in the buffer region (25% titration), and calculating the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   Initial concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final concentration (M₂) = (M₁ × V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**.\n\nSo, the solution we are titrating is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains. This mixture is a buffer solution, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka (1.85 x 10⁻⁵):\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acid. Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need to find the [OH⁻].\n*   Calculate the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate using Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Use the approximation for a weak base, [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]):\n    [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

The two points are:\n1.  **At 25% titration:** This is within the buffer region, where the solution contains a mixture of the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n2.  **At the equivalence point:** This is where all the weak acid has been completely neutralized by the strong base, and the solution contains only the conjugate base.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Account for the Initial Dilution**\nThe first step is to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after it is diluted with water.

Moles of acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol.\n*   **b. Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **c. Concentration of acetate at equivalence point (Careful Point 4: Use the total volume):**\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n    Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.0200 M**.\n*   **d. pH from hydrolysis:**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kb = Kw / Ka.\n    Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Now, find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] using the approximation for a weak base: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]).\n    [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.0200) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **e. Final pH calculation:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculations, which are consistently performed across all candidate answers, yield the following results:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing this pair of values to the given options:\nA) 4.73; 7.00\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.57; 6.92\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the critical points in the calculation.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly perform the chemical calculations but differ in which final option they select.

The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. The number of moles of acid remains constant, but the volume doubles to 40.00 cm³, which halves the concentration.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   New volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n    *   New concentration of acetic acid = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.

Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³.\n    *   **Total Volume**: The total volume is the sum of the diluted acid and the added base: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (0.0500 L).\n    *   **Concentration of Acetate**: The concentration of the acetate ion is the moles of acid divided by the total volume: [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n    *   **Hydrolysis Calculation**: The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.

This is a crucial first step.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve. I will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`, to find the pH. I'll need to calculate the pKa from the given Ka and determine the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid.\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.

Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Dilution:** The first step is a dilution. The initial concentration of acetic acid is not the concentration used in the titration. We must calculate the new concentration after adding water.\n*   **25% Titration Point:** This is a point in the buffer region. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the correct tool. The ratio of conjugate base to acid is key here.\n*   **Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate weak base. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base, not by simple neutralization (pH will not be 7.00). The total volume of the solution changes, which affects the concentration of the conjugate base.\n*   **Constants:** We need Ka for the acid, and from it, we can derive pKa. For the equivalence point, we need Kb for the conjugate base, which is derived from Ka and Kw (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   We use the dilution formula: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Concentration (M₂) = (M₁ × V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**.\n*   This is the concentration of the acetic acid solution that is being titrated.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At this point, the solution is a buffer. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains. The ratio [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   First, find the initial moles of acid:\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize this amount of acid:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   Now, calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate (A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻). We need Kb:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Use the equilibrium expression for the weak base to find [OH⁻]:\n    Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.73; 7.00\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer. The core of the problem is to calculate the pH at two distinct points in a weak acid-strong base titration.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: This is the first critical step. The initial acetic acid solution is diluted before the titration begins.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid: `Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol`.\n    *   The final volume after adding water is `20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³` or `0.04000 L`.\n    *   The new concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is `Moles / Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M`.\n    *   All candidate answers correctly perform this step.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**: At this point, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains. This creates a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool.\n    *   **Equation**: `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`\n    *   **pKa Calculation**: First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka.\n        `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733`\n    *   **Ratio Calculation**: The ratio of `[conjugate base]` to `[acid]` is `25% / 75%`, which simplifies to `1/3`.\n    *   **pH Calculation**:\n        `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)`\n        `pH = 4.733 - 0.477`\n        `pH ≈ 4.256`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the weak acid has been completely neutralized to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n    *   **Volume and Concentration at Equivalence**:\n        *   We need to add `0.001 mol` of NaOH to neutralize the `0.001 mol` of acid. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required is `Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L` or `10.00 cm³`.\n        *   The total volume of the solution is now `40.00 cm³` (diluted acid) + `10.00 cm³` (NaOH) = `50.00 cm³` or `0.0500 L`.\n        *   The concentration of the acetate ion is `[CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M`.\n    *   **Hydrolysis Calculation**: The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: `CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻`.\n        *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰`.\n        *   We can find the hydroxide concentration using the approximation `[OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻])`.\n        *   `[OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M`.\n    *   **Final pH Calculation**:\n        *   `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483`.\n        *   `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517`.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step calculation yields the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing these results to the provided options:\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.57; 6.92\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values match option D. While many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly, several made an error in matching their result to the correct lettered option. The chemical calculation is robust and consistently points to the values in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, including all the careful points required for an accurate solution.\n\n### **Analysis of the Calculation Steps**\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation for a weak acid-strong base titration. All candidate answers correctly identify the necessary steps, but some fail in the final matching of the result to the options. The consensus on the calculation methodology is strong and correct.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Initial Dilution**\nThe first and most crucial step is to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water. Forgetting this step is a common mistake.\n*   Initial Moles of Acetic Acid = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Final Volume after Dilution = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n*   New Concentration of Acetic Acid = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\nThis is the concentration that must be used for all subsequent titration calculations.\n\n**Careful Point 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**\nAt 25% titration, the solution contains a mixture of the unreacted weak acid (75%) and its newly formed conjugate base (25%). This is a classic buffer solution, and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct way to find the pH.\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   **pKa Calculation:** pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n*   **Ratio:** The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:** pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n*   Rounded to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base (acetate). The pH is not neutral (7.00) because this conjugate base hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n*   **Total Volume:** First, calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize 0.001 mol of acid: Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L (10.00 cm³). The total volume is 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion is the initial moles of acid divided by the total volume at the equivalence point: [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Hydrolysis Calculation:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water (CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻). We must calculate Kb for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** Using the approximation for a weak base, [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Final pH:** From [OH⁻], we find pOH = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483. Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounded to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step calculation robustly yields the following values:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nComparing this result with the provided options:\nA) 3.17; 6.73\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 4.57; 6.92\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option D. The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the overwhelming majority performed the chemical calculations correctly, several failed in the final step of matching their results to the correct lettered option.

Failing to do this will lead to incorrect results for all subsequent steps.\n    *   Initial Moles: (0.05 mol/L) * (0.02000 L) = 0.001 mol of acetic acid.\n    *   Final Volume: 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n    *   New Concentration: 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the correct tool.\n    *   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    *   **pKa Calculation:** pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   **Ratio:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to the conjugate base, while 75% remains. The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is therefore 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n    *   **pH Calculation:** pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base (acetate).

The two points are within the buffer region and at the equivalence point.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Initial Dilution:** This is a critical first step. The initial concentration of the acid is not what is being titrated.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The initial volume of 20.00 cm³ is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the new volume 40.00 cm³.\n    *   The new concentration of acetic acid for the titration is Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\n    *   All candidate answers correctly performed this step.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region):** At this point, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, while 75% remains.

I will solve it by breaking it down into three main steps: calculating the initial concentration after dilution, calculating the pH in the buffer region (25% titration), and calculating the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   Initial concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final concentration (M₂) = (M₁ × V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**.\n\nSo, the solution we are titrating is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains. This mixture is a buffer solution, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka (1.85 x 10⁻⁵):\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n*   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acid. Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻]:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need to find the [OH⁻].\n*   Calculate the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate using Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Use the approximation for a weak base, [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]):\n    [OH⁻] = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

Let's verify the calculation.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: This is a crucial first step. The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. The number of moles of acid remains constant, but the volume doubles to 40.00 cm³, which halves the concentration.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   New volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n    *   New concentration of acetic acid = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**. This is the concentration to be used for the titration calculation.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region)**: At this point, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, while 75% remains. This creates a buffer solution, and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the correct tool.\n    *   **Equation**: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    *   **pKa Calculation**: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   **Ratio**: The ratio of [conjugate base] to [acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n    *   **pH Calculation**: pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point (Hydrolysis)**: At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n    *   **Volume of NaOH**: First, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the acid. Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³.\n    *   **Total Volume**: The total volume is the sum of the diluted acid and the added base: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (0.0500 L).\n    *   **Concentration of Acetate**: The concentration of the acetate ion is the moles of acid divided by the total volume: [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n    *   **Hydrolysis Calculation**: The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   **Kb Calculation**: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   **[OH⁻] Calculation**: Using the equilibrium expression Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻], we solve for [OH⁻]: [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   **Final pH**: First find pOH = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483. Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculations consistently and correctly yield a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and a pH of **8.52** at the equivalence point.
