The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.

The mole fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the following formula, which was unanimously used by all candidate agents:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Input Values**:\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Assumptions**:\n    *   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. A critical and valid assumption, made by all agents, is that the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration. This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M).\n    *   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. Its value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration. The *percentage* distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.\n    *   **Denominator Term for Free Ion**: The '1' in the denominator is a crucial term representing the uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ion (where β₀ = 1). This was correctly included in all calculations.\n\n5.  **Calculation Verification**: The calculation is performed by substituting the values into the formula.\n    *   **Numerator**:\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage**:\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers that showed their work arrived at this same numerical result. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates appear to stem from different orderings of the multiple-choice options they were presented with.\n\nBased on the options provided in the question:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the final answer, a comprehensive analysis of the problem is required, taking into account the methodologies and results from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective**: The primary goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Governing Principle**: This is a chemical equilibrium problem involving the formation of multiple complex ions. The distribution of these species is determined by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β) for each complex. The percentage of a specific species is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100.\n\n3.  **Formula**: The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, is given by the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    For the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate α₂:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    This formula was correctly identified and used by all candidate answers.\n\n4.  **Calculation**: The next step is to substitute the given values into the formula.\n    *   **Given Values**:\n        *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n        *   β₁ = 9\n        *   β₂ = 40\n        *   β₃ = 63\n        *   β₄ = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**:\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is the sum of terms for all species, from the free ion (n=0) to the final complex (n=4).\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage Calculation**:\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration Approximation**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). All candidate answers correctly applied this assumption.\n*   **Independence from Total Metal Concentration**: The percentage distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total metal concentration (`c(Co)`), as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration approximation.\n*   **Unanimous Calculation Result**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the calculation itself.\n*   **Source of Discrepancy**: The only disagreements among the candidate answers arose from incorrectly matching the calculated value (16.9%) to the lettered multiple-choice options. The options provided in the prompt are A) 38.1%, B) 42.3%, C) 25.6%, and D) 16.9%.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**. Based on the options provided in the question, this value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first carefully analyze the problem and the provided candidate answers. The consensus among the answers points to a specific calculation method, which I will verify. I will then write a Python script to perform this calculation accurately to avoid any manual errors. Finally, I will compare the calculated result with the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The core task is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Formula:** The percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration ([L]). For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the formula is:\n    α₂ = (β₂[L]²) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\n    This formula is consistently used across all candidate answers, indicating it is the correct approach.\n\n3.  **List Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem gives the *total* thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. Since this is in large excess (10x) compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. So, we will use `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the formula's derivation. Its value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration.\n    *   **Denominator Term:** The '1' in the denominator is crucial as it represents the fraction of the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** I will use Python to execute the calculation based on the formula and the given values to ensure precision. The script will calculate the numerator and denominator, find the mole fraction, and convert it to a percentage.\n\n```python\n# Define the given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], is its mole fraction (alpha_2) * 100.\n# The formula for the mole fraction is:\n# alpha_2 = (beta_2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta_1*[SCN-]^1 + beta_2*[SCN-]^2 + beta_3*[SCN-]^3 + beta_4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# Calculate the numerator term for the desired complex (n=2)\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species (n=0 to 4)\n# The term for n=0 (free Co2+) is 1.\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the mole fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\n# Print the calculated result and compare it with the given options\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nGiven options:\")\nprint(\"A) 25.6%\")\nprint(\"B) 38.1%\")\nprint(\"C) 42.3%\")\nprint(\"D) 16.9%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\")\n\n# Final Answer Choice\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice:\")\nprint(\"D\")\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: 16.9%\n\nGiven options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\nFinal Answer Choice:\nD\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Objective**\nThe goal is to determine the percentage of one specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex in a solution with multiple competing equilibria is given by its mole fraction (αₙ) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The correct formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**Step 3: List Careful Points and Assumptions**\n1.  **Free Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration, 0.1 M. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (ten times greater) compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n2.  **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the formula. The value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration approximation mentioned above.\n3.  **The '1' in the Denominator:** The denominator must include the term '1' (where β₀ = 1) to account for the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the α₂ fraction:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction α₂:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**Step 5: Match Result to Options**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.

Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:**\n    The denominator is the sum of terms for all species, where the term for the free `Co²⁺` ion (n=0) is 1.\n    *   Term (n=0): 1\n    *   Term (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of 16.9%.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. It is a standard and valid approximation to use the total concentration because it is in large excess (10x) compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M).\n2.  **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not directly used in the percentage calculation itself. Its value is important for justifying the approximation of the free ligand concentration mentioned in the point above.\n3.  **Inclusion of the Free Metal Ion**: The '1' in the denominator of the mole fraction formula is crucial. It represents the fraction of uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ = 1) and must be included in the sum of all species.\n4.  **Matching Calculation to Option**: The numerical result of the calculation is unequivocally 16.9%. The primary source of error in the candidate answers was incorrectly matching this value to the lettered options. Based on the options provided in the question (A) 25.6%, B) 42.3%, C) 16.9%, D) 38.1%, the calculated value corresponds to option C.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis confirms that all candidate answers correctly performed the calculation to arrive at a numerical value of 16.9%. The correct multiple-choice option corresponding to this value is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the methods and careful points from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (denoted as α₂) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]). The correct formula, which all candidate answers agree upon, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. List Given Values and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Free Ligand Concentration**\n    The formula requires the *free* thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (ten times greater) compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. This is because the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, which is a common factor in the concentration of every species, cancels out from the numerator and denominator during the formula's derivation. The value of `c(Co)` is primarily used to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Denominator's \"1\"**\n    The denominator of the mole fraction formula must include a \"1\" term. This term represents the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1). Omitting this term would lead to an incorrect result.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the formula for α₂ and the given values:\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:**\n    The denominator is the sum of terms for each species from n=0 to n=4.\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a result of approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers that showed their work arrived at this same numerical result, indicating a strong consensus on the calculation method. The discrepancies in the final answers from the agents were due to inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options.\n\nReferring to the options provided in the original question:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the problem statement, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Governing Principle and Formula:**\nThis is a chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation. The percentage of any single species is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2) is given by the following standard formula, which was correctly identified and used by all candidate agents:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Free Ligand Concentration.** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Independence from Total Metal Concentration.** The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) does not directly use the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`. This is because the concentration of the free metal ion, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out during the derivation of the formula. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Formula Integrity.** The denominator must include the term '1', which represents the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions relative to itself. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nUsing the given values and the formula from Step 2:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species:\n*   **Numerator** = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = 0.0016\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, we convert the mole fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers correctly performed this calculation. The only discrepancies arose from some agents having a different ordering of the multiple-choice options. Based on the options provided in the original question:\n\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1.

The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. A critical and valid assumption is that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total concentration. This is justified because the total ligand (0.1 M) is in large excess (10x) compared to the total metal (0.01 M), so only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed in complex formation.\n2.  **Independence from Total Metal Concentration:** The percentage distribution of the various complexes is independent of the total metal concentration, `c(Co)`. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. The `c(Co)` value is only needed to justify the ligand concentration approximation.\n3.  **Consensus on Calculation:** There is a complete consensus among all candidate answers on the calculation method and the final numerical result of 16.9%. This provides very high confidence in the correctness of the calculation.\n4.  **Discrepancy in Final Choice:** The primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers is not the chemistry or the math, but a clerical error in matching the calculated result (16.9%) to the correct lettered option.

Governing Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is determined by its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration ([L]). For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThis formula was correctly identified and used by all candidate answers, indicating a consensus on the fundamental approach.\n\n**3.

This is a valid and standard assumption because the ligand is in large excess (0.1 M) compared to the metal ion (0.01 M).\n2.  **Independence from Total Metal Concentration**: The final percentage distribution of the complexes is independent of the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`. This value is only used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration.\n3.  **Inclusion of the Free Ion**: It is crucial that the denominator includes the term '1', which accounts for the fraction of uncomplexed, free `Co²⁺` ions in the solution.\n4.  **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%.\n5.  **Matching Result to Options**: The primary source of error among the candidate answers was matching the calculated value (16.9%) to the correct lettered option, as the options were presented in a different order in each case.

List Values and Analyze Assumptions\nThe given values are:\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\nThere are several important points to consider:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Free Ligand Concentration.** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, not the total concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate bound to cobalt is negligible. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Role of Total Cobalt Concentration.** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. This is because the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator during the formula's derivation. The value is primarily used to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Denominator Term for Free Metal.** The '1' in the denominator is a crucial term representing the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1). This was correctly included in all candidate calculations.\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nUsing the formula for α₂ and the established values:\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator:**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator:**\n    The denominator is the sum of terms for all species from n=0 to n=4.\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of approximately **16.9%**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reconciling Candidate Answers.** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of ~16.9%.

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a re-evaluation of the problem, the following step-by-step analysis determines the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Objective**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species present in the solution.\n\n**2. Governing Formula**\nThe distribution of complex species in an equilibrium system is determined by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β). The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100. For the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the mole fraction (α₂) is given by the following standard formula, which was unanimously and correctly used by all candidate answers:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Calculation**\nThe calculation involves substituting the given values into the formula:\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant, β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant, β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant, β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant, β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:** The term corresponding to the desired `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is:\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:** The denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species, from the free ion (n=0) to the final complex (n=4).\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0, where β₀=1): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A critical and valid assumption, made by all candidates, is that the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed.\n\n2.  **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. Its value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration as described above. The *percentage* distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.\n\n3.  **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1) and is essential for calculating the correct total concentration of all cobalt species.\n\n4.  **Reconciling Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, shuffled order to each agent. The consensus on the calculation itself is absolute.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a result of **16.9%**.

The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). All candidate answers correctly applied this assumption.\n*   **Independence from Total Metal Concentration**: The percentage distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total metal concentration (`c(Co)`), as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration approximation.\n*   **Unanimous Calculation Result**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the calculation itself.\n*   **Source of Discrepancy**: The only disagreements among the candidate answers arose from incorrectly matching the calculated value (16.9%) to the lettered multiple-choice options.

The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration ([L]). For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the formula is:\n    α₂ = (β₂[L]²) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\n    This formula is consistently used across all candidate answers, indicating it is the correct approach.\n\n3.  **List Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem gives the *total* thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. Since this is in large excess (10x) compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. So, we will use `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M.\n    *   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the formula's derivation.

The problem provides the *total* concentration, 0.1 M. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (ten times greater) compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n2.  **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the formula. The value is primarily used to justify the ligand concentration approximation mentioned above.\n3.  **The '1' in the Denominator:** The denominator must include the term '1' (where β₀ = 1) to account for the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the α₂ fraction:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction α₂:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**Step 5: Match Result to Options**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.

The correct formula, which all candidate answers agree upon, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Given Values**:\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n4.  **Calculation**:\n    *   **Numerator**: The term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is calculated as:\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**: The denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species.\n        *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0, β₀=1): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂)**: The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator.\n        α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage**: To get the final percentage, the mole fraction is multiplied by 100.\n        Percentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The calculation requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a valid and standard chemical approximation to assume that the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`).\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out during the formula's derivation. Its value is primarily used to justify the approximation of the free ligand concentration.\n*   **Denominator Integrity**: The denominator must include the term '1' to account for the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions. Omitting this term is a common mistake but was avoided by all candidate answers.\n*   **Matching Result to Options**: The calculation robustly yields ~16.9%.

For the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to find α₂. The formula, which is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers, is:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Verify Given Values**:\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Overall stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   **Numerator**: The term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is:\n        β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Denominator**: The denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt species (where the term for the free Co²⁺ ion is 1):\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   **Sum of Denominator**: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n    *   **Calculate Mole Fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Convert to Percentage**:\n        Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value is approximately **16.9%**. This matches option A from the provided list.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A critical and valid assumption, made by all candidates, is that the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M).\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself. Its value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration. The *percentage* distribution of complexes is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.\n*   **Correctness of the Formula**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator to account for the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions. All candidate answers correctly did this.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option**: The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the calculation was performed correctly by all, there was confusion in matching the numerical result (16.9%) to the correct lettered option, likely due to different ordering of options in their prompts. Based on the options provided in the question, 16.9% corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the consensus from the provided answers and highlighting all careful points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Objective**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Governing Principle and Formula**\nThe distribution of different complex species in a solution is determined by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β). The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100.\n\nFor the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to find the mole fraction α₂. The formula, which is correctly identified and used by all candidate answers, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:**\n    The denominator is the sum of terms for all species, where the term for the free `Co²⁺` ion (n=0) is 1.\n    *   Term (n=0): 1\n    *   Term (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of 16.9%.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. It is a standard and valid approximation to use the total concentration because it is in large excess (10x) compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M).\n2.  **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not directly used in the percentage calculation itself. Its value is important for justifying the approximation of the free ligand concentration mentioned in the point above.\n3.  **Inclusion of the Free Metal Ion**: The '1' in the denominator of the mole fraction formula is crucial. It represents the fraction of uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ = 1) and must be included in the sum of all species.\n4.  **Matching Calculation to Option**: The numerical result of the calculation is unequivocally 16.9%. The primary source of error in the candidate answers was incorrectly matching this value to the lettered options. Based on the options provided in the question (A) 25.6%, B) 42.3%, C) 16.9%, D) 38.1%, the calculated value corresponds to option C.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis confirms that all candidate answers correctly performed the calculation to arrive at a numerical value of 16.9%.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (α) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (denoted as α₂) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]). The correct formula, which all candidate answers agree upon, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. List Given Values and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Free Ligand Concentration**\n    The formula requires the *free* thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (ten times greater) compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. This is because the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, which is a common factor in the concentration of every species, cancels out from the numerator and denominator during the formula's derivation. The value of `c(Co)` is primarily used to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Denominator's \"1\"**\n    The denominator of the mole fraction formula must include a \"1\" term. This term represents the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1). Omitting this term would lead to an incorrect result.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the formula for α₂ and the given values:\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:**\n    The denominator is the sum of terms for each species from n=0 to n=4.\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a result of approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers that showed their work arrived at this same numerical result, indicating a strong consensus on the calculation method. The discrepancies in the final answers from the agents were due to inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options.\n\nReferring to the options provided in the original question:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the problem statement, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Governing Principle and Formula:**\nThis is a chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation. The percentage of any single species is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2) is given by the following standard formula, which was correctly identified and used by all candidate agents:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Free Ligand Concentration.** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Independence from Total Metal Concentration.** The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) does not directly use the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`. This is because the concentration of the free metal ion, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out during the derivation of the formula. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Formula Integrity.** The denominator must include the term '1', which represents the fraction of free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions relative to itself. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nUsing the given values and the formula from Step 2:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species:\n*   **Numerator** = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = 0.0016\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, we convert the mole fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers correctly performed this calculation. The only discrepancies arose from some agents having a different ordering of the multiple-choice options.

Governing Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the formula:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\nThis formula was correctly identified and used by all candidate agents, indicating a strong consensus on the correct theoretical approach.\n\n**3.

The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. A critical and valid assumption is that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total concentration. This is justified because the total ligand (0.1 M) is in large excess (10x) compared to the total metal (0.01 M), so only a small fraction of the ligand is consumed in complex formation.\n2.  **Independence from Total Metal Concentration:** The percentage distribution of the various complexes is independent of the total metal concentration, `c(Co)`. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. The `c(Co)` value is only needed to justify the ligand concentration approximation.\n3.  **Consensus on Calculation:** There is a complete consensus among all candidate answers on the calculation method and the final numerical result of 16.9%. This provides very high confidence in the correctness of the calculation.\n4.  **Discrepancy in Final Choice:** The primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers is not the chemistry or the math, but a clerical error in matching the calculated result (16.9%) to the correct lettered option.

For the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2), the mole fraction α₂ is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The correct formula, which all candidate answers unanimously agree upon, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**: We substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator**:\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**: The denominator is the sum of terms for all species, from the free ion `Co²⁺` (n=0) to the final complex `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4).\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Convert to Percentage**:\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n4.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value is **16.9%**.

A critical and valid assumption, made by all candidate answers, is that the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M). This is justified because the total ligand concentration is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal ion concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`).\n*   **Independence from Total Metal Concentration**: The *percentage* distribution of the various complex species is independent of the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula. The `c(Co)` value is only needed to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration.\n*   **Formula Integrity**: It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions and is essential for calculating the correct total concentration of all cobalt species.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Errors**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the numerical result of ~16.9%. The discrepancies in their final answers stemmed from incorrectly matching this value to the lettered options, likely due to variations in how the options were presented to them. The calculation itself is robust and the consensus is clear.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step re-evaluation of the problem, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Objective**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Governing Formula**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is determined by its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration ([L]). For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThis formula was correctly identified and used by all candidate answers, indicating a consensus on the fundamental approach.\n\n**3. Calculation**\nThe calculation proceeds by substituting the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n**Numerator Calculation:**\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n**Denominator Calculation:**\nThe denominator is the sum of terms for all species, from the free ion (n=0) to the final complex (n=4).\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0, β₀=1): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = 0.0016\n\nSum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n**Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**Percentage Calculation:**\nPercentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free Ligand Concentration Assumption**: The calculation uses the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) as an approximation for the free ligand concentration at equilibrium. This is a valid and standard assumption because the ligand is in large excess (0.1 M) compared to the metal ion (0.01 M).\n2.  **Independence from Total Metal Concentration**: The final percentage distribution of the complexes is independent of the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`. This value is only used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration.\n3.  **Inclusion of the Free Ion**: It is crucial that the denominator includes the term '1', which accounts for the fraction of uncomplexed, free `Co²⁺` ions in the solution.\n4.  **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 16.9%.\n5.  **Matching Result to Options**: The primary source of error among the candidate answers was matching the calculated value (16.9%) to the correct lettered option, as the options were presented in a different order in each case. For the options given in this specific problem (A) 16.9%, B) 38.1%, C) 25.6%, D) 42.3%, the calculated value of 16.9% corresponds directly to option A.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**. Based on the options provided in the question, this value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 2. Identify the Correct Formula\nThe percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2), denoted as α₂, is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The correct formula, which all candidate answers unanimously agree upon, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n### 3. List Values and Analyze Assumptions\nThe given values are:\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\nThere are several important points to consider:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Free Ligand Concentration.** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, not the total concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate bound to cobalt is negligible. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Role of Total Cobalt Concentration.** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. This is because the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator during the formula's derivation. The value is primarily used to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Denominator Term for Free Metal.** The '1' in the denominator is a crucial term representing the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions (where β₀ is defined as 1). This was correctly included in all candidate calculations.\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nUsing the formula for α₂ and the established values:\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator:**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator:**\n    The denominator is the sum of terms for all species from n=0 to n=4.\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   **Sum of Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculation consistently yields a result of approximately **16.9%**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reconciling Candidate Answers.** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the calculation and arrived at the same numerical result of ~16.9%. The apparent disagreement in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, shuffled order to each agent. However, the consensus on the calculation itself is absolute.\n\nBased on the options provided in the question prompt:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
