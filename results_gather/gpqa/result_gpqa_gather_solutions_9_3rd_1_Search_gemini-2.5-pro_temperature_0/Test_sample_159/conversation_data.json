All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.\n\nA) 0.610 \\lambda / a\nB) 0.506 \\lambda / a\nC) 1.220 \\lambda /a\nD) 0.500 \\lambda / a\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to decide the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem begins with an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. The crucial part is the limit where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞). In this limit, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem converges to a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the physical system is equivalent to a circular aperture of radius 'a'. All candidate answers correctly identified this fundamental point.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\" after monochromatic light passes through the aperture. This is the definition of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern created by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Intensity Minima\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (minima) in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (or zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), so the formula simplifies to:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is almost universally interpreted by the candidate answers as the difference between the angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo perform this calculation, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁(x) function, which are well-known constants:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is then:\n`Δθ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We now compare this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is in excellent agreement with option C, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Aperture Interpretation:** The most important step is correctly identifying that an N-sided polygon with N→∞ and constant apothem 'a' becomes a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n2.  **Question Interpretation:** The phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\" refers to the separation between the first and second dark rings (`θ₂ - θ₁`). It is crucial not to confuse this with other related quantities.\n3.  **Distractor Analysis:** The other options correspond to common, but incorrect, interpretations:\n    *   **Option A (0.610 λ / a):** This is the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`) itself.\n    *   **Option D (1.220 λ / a):** This is the angular *width* of the central bright maximum (`2θ₁`), also known as the Airy disk. This is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other.\n4.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The calculation relies on the known zeros of the Bessel function. The result `~0.5067` is robust and consistently derived across the candidate answers that perform the correct calculation.\n\nBased on the unanimous agreement on the physics and the overwhelming consensus on the interpretation of the question, the calculation leads directly to the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. In the limit where the number of sides N approaches infinity (N → ∞), the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a', which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'. All candidate answers correctly identified this crucial first step.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\" after light passes through the aperture. This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula simplifies to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is correctly interpreted by the vast majority of the candidate answers as the difference in the angular positions of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function:\n*   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference between the two positions:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( 3.1839 / 6.2832 ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We compare this with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is in excellent agreement with option D, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Geometric Interpretation**: The most important initial step is to correctly identify that an N-sided polygon with N→∞ and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a'.\n2.  **Question Interpretation**: It is critical to interpret \"angular distance between the first two minima\" as the separation between the first and second dark rings, which is `θ₂ - θ₁`. This must be distinguished from other physically significant quantities that are provided as distractor options:\n    *   The position of the first minimum is `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ/a` (Option B).\n    *   The angular width of the central maximum (the Airy disk) is `2θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ/a` (Option C).\n3.  **Bessel Function Zeros**: The calculation is dependent on using the correct values for the first two non-zero roots of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n4.  **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: While the final letter choices of the candidate answers vary, this is due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual prompts. The core physical reasoning and the final numerical result (`~0.506`) are overwhelmingly consistent across all provided analyses.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first understand the physical setup described in the problem, then formulate the mathematical equations that govern the diffraction pattern, and finally, use Python to perform the necessary calculations to find the correct answer among the choices.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry:** The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. I will first establish that as N approaches infinity, this shape becomes a circle with a radius equal to the apothem 'a'.\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:** The problem mentions a monochromatic light creating an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region.\" This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the pattern is known as an Airy pattern.\n3.  **Formulate the Condition for Minima:** The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). I will write down the formula that relates the angle of a minimum (`θ_m`) to the m-th zero of this function (`z_m`).\n4.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This is the crucial interpretation step. The most direct meaning is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`). I will also consider other possibilities, such as the width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`), to analyze the distractor options.\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** I will use Python with the `scipy` library to find the precise values of the first two zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function. Then, I will calculate the coefficient for the angular distance `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁` and compare it to the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and determine the answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Step 1 & 2: The problem describes Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# Step 3: The angular position of the m-th minimum is given by:\n# theta_m = (z_m / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# where z_m is the m-th non-zero root of the J1 Bessel function.\n\n# Step 4: The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima.\n# This is calculated as delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.\n# The coefficient for this distance is (z_2 - z_1) / (2 * pi).\n\n# Step 5: Use scipy to find the first two non-zero roots of J1(x).\ntry:\n    # jn_zeros(n, k) finds the first k positive zeros of the Bessel function Jn(x).\n    # We need the first 2 zeros of J1(x).\n    zeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\n    z1 = zeros[0]\n    z2 = zeros[1]\n\n    # Calculate the coefficients for the positions of the first two minima.\n    coeff_theta1 = z1 / (2 * np.pi)\n    coeff_theta2 = z2 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n    # Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance between them.\n    delta_coeff = coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1\n    \n    # Also calculate the coefficient for the width of the central maximum for comparison.\n    coeff_central_width = 2 * coeff_theta1\n\n    print(\"Analysis of physical quantities and comparison with options:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Position of the 1st minimum (theta_1) corresponds to a coefficient of: {coeff_theta1:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"Position of the 2nd minimum (theta_2) corresponds to a coefficient of: {coeff_theta2:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"Angular width of the central maximum (2*theta_1) corresponds to a coefficient of: {coeff_central_width:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"Angular distance between 1st and 2nd minima (theta_2 - theta_1) corresponds to a coefficient of: {delta_coeff:.3f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    print(\"Comparing the calculated coefficient for the angular distance between the first two minima with the given options:\")\n    print(f\"Calculated coefficient: {delta_coeff:.3f}\")\n    print(\"A) 0.506\")\n    print(\"B) 1.220\")\n    print(\"C) 0.500\")\n    print(\"D) 0.610\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value 0.507 (rounded from 0.5067...) is best matched by option A.\")\n\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"SciPy library not found.

The question asks for the **\"angular distance between the first two minima\"**.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Interpretation):** This phrase most literally means the angular separation between the first dark ring (m=1) and the second dark ring (m=2). This corresponds to the calculation `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`. An alternative, but less likely, interpretation could be the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other side (`2θ₁`), which is the angular width of the central maximum.\n*   **Calculation:** To proceed, we need the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    The angular distance is then:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.

This is a very common quantity in optics, often related to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus of the candidate answers, combined with a rigorous step-by-step analysis, confirms that the question asks for `θ₂ - θ₁`. The calculation for this quantity yields a coefficient of approximately 0.5067, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'.

The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), which simplifies the formula to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is correctly interpreted by the vast majority of the candidate answers as the difference in the angular positions of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function, which are well-known constants:\n*   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference between the positions calculated using these zeros:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( 3.1839 / 6.2832 ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We now compare this result with the given options:\n\nA) 1.220 \\lambda /a\nB) 0.506 \\lambda / a\nC) 0.610 \\lambda / a\nD) 0.500 \\lambda / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is in excellent agreement with option B, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Aperture Geometry**: The most important initial step is to correctly identify that the N-sided polygon with N→∞ and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n*   **Interpretation of the Question**: The phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\" refers to the separation between the first and second dark rings (`θ₂ - θ₁`). It is crucial not to confuse this with other related quantities.\n*   **Analysis of Distractors**: The other options represent common incorrect answers or misinterpretations:\n    *   **Option A (1.220 λ /a)** corresponds to `2θ₁`, which is the angular *width* of the central bright maximum (the Airy disk). This is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other.\n    *   **Option C (0.610 λ / a)** corresponds to `θ₁`, the angular *position* of the first minimum itself.\n    *   **Option D (0.500 λ / a)** is a less precise approximation of the correct answer.\n\nThe consistent analysis across nearly all candidate answers, backed by a direct calculation, confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to decide the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the first key step. The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, the polygon converges to a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius 'a' of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes observing an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region,\" which corresponds to Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings are the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula simplifies to:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Result\nThis is the most critical step. The question asks for \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrase is most logically interpreted as the angular separation between the first minimum (m=1) and the second minimum (m=2). This corresponds to the calculation `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nTo perform this calculation, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁(x) Bessel function:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is then:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Options and Careful Points\nThe calculated value is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Now we compare this to the options provided in the prompt:\n*   **A) 0.506 λ / a**: This value is an excellent match for our calculated result `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n*   **B) 1.220 λ /a**: This value corresponds to `2 * θ₁ ≈ 1.220 * (λ / a)`. This is the angular *width* of the central bright maximum (the Airy disk), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other. This is a different physical quantity.\n*   **C) 0.500 λ / a**: This is a less precise approximation of the correct answer.\n*   **D) 0.610 λ / a**: This value corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum, `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`. It is not the distance between two minima.\n\nThe most direct and literal interpretation of the question \"angular distance between the first two minima\" is `θ₂ - θ₁`. This interpretation is supported by the overwhelming consensus of the candidate answers and leads directly to the calculated value of `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.

We are asked to consider the case where the number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N → ∞). In this limit, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem converges to a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'. All candidate answers correctly identified this crucial first step.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes monochromatic light creating an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region.\" This is the definition of Fraunhofer diffraction.

The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle `θ_m` is given by:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The formula simplifies to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Result\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is the most critical part to interpret correctly.\n*   The \"first minimum\" corresponds to m=1 (`θ₁`).\n*   The \"second minimum\" corresponds to m=2 (`θ₂`).\n*   The \"angular distance between\" them is the difference: `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nTo perform the calculation, we need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular distance:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values for the zeros:\n\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Identify Careful Points\n\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.

In the limit that the number of sides N approaches infinity (N → ∞), the polygon converges to a perfect circle. The apothem of the polygon, which is the perpendicular distance from the center to a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the physical system is equivalent to a circular aperture of radius 'a'. All candidate answers correctly identified this crucial first step.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\" from monochromatic light passing through the aperture. This is the definition of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern for a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Intensity Minima\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (minima) in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (or zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation (`tan θ ≈ θ`, which implies `sin θ ≈ θ`). The formula simplifies to:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Result\nThis is the most critical step for selecting the correct option. The question asks for the **\"angular distance between the first two minima\"**.\n\n*   **Interpretation:** The most direct and standard interpretation of this phrase is the angular separation between the first dark ring (m=1) and the second dark ring (m=2). This corresponds to the calculation `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n*   **Calculation:** To perform this calculation, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁(x) Bessel function, which are well-known constants:\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is then:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Options and Make a Final Decision\nThe calculated value for the angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Now we compare this to the given options:\n\n*   **A) 0.506 λ / a:** This value is an excellent match for our calculated result of `0.5067 λ / a`.\n*   **B) 0.610 λ / a:** This value corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a`). This is a common distractor but is not the distance between the first and second minima.\n*   **C) 0.500 λ / a:** This is a close but less accurate approximation of the correct answer.\n*   **D) 1.220 λ /a:** This value corresponds to the angular *width* of the central bright maximum (`2 * θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ/a`), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other. While this is an important physical quantity (related to the Rayleigh criterion), it does not fit the most literal interpretation of the question.\n\n**Conclusion:** The calculation based on the standard interpretation of the question yields a value of `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. This is consistent with the overwhelming majority of the candidate answers.

We are asked to consider the case where the number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N → ∞). In this limit, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem converges to a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes monochromatic light creating an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region.\" This is the domain of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern for a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings are the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ`.

The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ`. The formula becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Result\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is most naturally interpreted as the difference between the angular position of the second minimum (m=2) and the first minimum (m=1).\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the angular distance:\n`Δθ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe code execution from the previous step has already confirmed the value of the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`. The output was `0.5067`.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculation yields a coefficient of approximately 0.5067. The angular distance is therefore `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this with the given options:\n\n*   A) `0.610 λ / a`: This corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / 2π) * λ/a`).

For a circular aperture, the specific diffraction pattern is known as an **Airy pattern**. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The question asks about the positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) in this Airy pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the dark rings are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The condition for the m-th minimum (where m = 1, 2, 3, ...) at an angle θₘ is given by `k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`.\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n*   **Approximation:** The problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ`. The formula simplifies to `(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Solving for the angular position of the m-th minimum gives:\n    `θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Result\nThis is the most critical step. The question asks for the **\"angular distance between the first two minima\"**.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Interpretation):** This phrase most literally means the angular separation between the first dark ring (m=1) and the second dark ring (m=2). This corresponds to the calculation `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`. An alternative, but less likely, interpretation could be the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other side (`2θ₁`), which is the angular width of the central maximum.\n*   **Calculation:** To proceed, we need the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    The angular distance is then:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We must compare this to the provided options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\n*   Our calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is an excellent match for **Option A**.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Distractors):** It is crucial to recognize what the other options represent.\n    *   **Option B (0.610 λ / a):** This corresponds to the position of the *first* minimum, `θ₁ ≈ (z₁ / 2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a`.\n    *   **Option D (1.220 λ /a):** This corresponds to the angular *width* of the central bright maximum, `2θ₁ ≈ (z₁ / π) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.220 λ/a`. This is a very common quantity in optics, often related to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus of the candidate answers, combined with a rigorous step-by-step analysis, confirms that the question asks for `θ₂ - θ₁`. The calculation for this quantity yields a coefficient of approximately 0.5067, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nThe problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. In the limit where the number of sides N approaches infinity (N → ∞), the polygon converges to a perfect circle. The apothem, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'. All candidate answers correctly identified this crucial first step.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\" after light passes through the aperture. This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) in an Airy pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, denoted as J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), which simplifies the formula to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This is correctly interpreted by the vast majority of the candidate answers as the difference in the angular positions of the second minimum (`θ₂`) and the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n\nTo calculate this, we need the first two non-zero zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function, which are well-known constants:\n*   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference between the positions calculated using these zeros:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( 3.1839 / 6.2832 ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. We now compare this result with the given options:\n\nA) 1.220 \\lambda /a\nB) 0.506 \\lambda / a\nC) 0.610 \\lambda / a\nD) 0.500 \\lambda / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is in excellent agreement with option B, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Aperture Geometry**: The most important initial step is to correctly identify that the N-sided polygon with N→∞ and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n*   **Interpretation of the Question**: The phrase \"angular distance between the first two minima\" refers to the separation between the first and second dark rings (`θ₂ - θ₁`). It is crucial not to confuse this with other related quantities.\n*   **Analysis of Distractors**: The other options represent common incorrect answers or misinterpretations:\n    *   **Option A (1.220 λ /a)** corresponds to `2θ₁`, which is the angular *width* of the central bright maximum (the Airy disk). This is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other.\n    *   **Option C (0.610 λ / a)** corresponds to `θ₁`, the angular *position* of the first minimum itself.\n    *   **Option D (0.500 λ / a)** is a less precise approximation of the correct answer.\n\nThe consistent analysis across nearly all candidate answers, backed by a direct calculation, confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to decide the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the first key step. The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, the polygon converges to a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius 'a' of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes observing an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region,\" which corresponds to Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings are the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle θₘ is:\n`k * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `zₘ` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula simplifies to:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (zₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Result\nThis is the most critical step. The question asks for \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrase is most logically interpreted as the angular separation between the first minimum (m=1) and the second minimum (m=2). This corresponds to the calculation `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nTo perform this calculation, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁(x) Bessel function:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular distance is then:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Options and Careful Points\nThe calculated value is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Now we compare this to the options provided in the prompt:\n*   **A) 0.506 λ / a**: This value is an excellent match for our calculated result `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n*   **B) 1.220 λ /a**: This value corresponds to `2 * θ₁ ≈ 1.220 * (λ / a)`. This is the angular *width* of the central bright maximum (the Airy disk), which is the distance between the first minimum on one side of the center and the first minimum on the other. This is a different physical quantity.\n*   **C) 0.500 λ / a**: This is a less precise approximation of the correct answer.\n*   **D) 0.610 λ / a**: This value corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum, `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`. It is not the distance between two minima.\n\nThe most direct and literal interpretation of the question \"angular distance between the first two minima\" is `θ₂ - θ₁`. This interpretation is supported by the overwhelming consensus of the candidate answers and leads directly to the calculated value of `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.

The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. In the limit where the number of sides, N, approaches infinity (N → ∞), the polygon converges to a perfect circle. The apothem, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle.\n*   **Conclusion**: The problem is equivalent to analyzing Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'. All candidate answers correctly identify this crucial point.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem describes the formation of an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\" from monochromatic light. This is the domain of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.

The condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The formula simplifies to:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Perform the Calculation\nThis is the most critical step.

While this is a very important quantity (related to the Rayleigh criterion), it is not what is asked.\n2.  **Consensus**: All candidate answers that correctly interpret the question as `θ₂ - θ₁` arrive at the same numerical result of approximately `0.5067`.
