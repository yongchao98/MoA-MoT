    "In this question, we need to identify the physical theory that does not require regularization at high energies. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Regularization** is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, that arise in calculations of physical quantities. These divergences typically come from loop diagrams, which represent the contributions of virtual particles at very high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances). Regularization works by introducing a parameter, like an energy cutoff, to make these divergent integrals mathematically tractable. The infinities are then systematically removed through a process called renormalization.\n\n1.  **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory of the strong interaction. Like other non-trivial quantum field theories, calculations in QCD involve loop diagrams (e.g., containing virtual quarks and gluons). These loops lead to UV divergences that must be handled by regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n\n2.  **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It was the first theory where regularization and renormalization were successfully applied. Calculations of quantities like the electron's self-energy or the Lamb shift involve divergent loop integrals of virtual electron-positron pairs, which necessitate regularization. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n3.  **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory describes the interactions of electric charges and currents using Maxwell's equations. It is a classical, not quantum, theory. As such, it does not involve the quantum loop diagrams that are the typical source of UV divergences in quantum field theory. However, classical electrodynamics has its own high-energy problem: the self-energy of a point-like electron is infinite. To calculate the energy stored in the electric field of a point charge, one has to integrate over all space, and the integral diverges as the distance from the charge approaches zero. This indicates a breakdown of the theory at short distances (high energies) and suggests that a point charge is an unphysical idealization. While the term \"regularization\" is most commonly associated with quantum loops, attempts to resolve this classical divergence (e.g., by giving the electron a finite radius) are conceptually similar. In any case, its quantum successor, QED, definitely requires regularization.\n\n4.  **C) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that aims to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. A key feature and one of its main motivations is that it is believed to be free from ultraviolet (UV) divergences. Unlike in quantum field theories, where fundamental particles are treated as points, in string theory, they are one-dimensional, vibrating \"strings.\" This extended nature of strings smooths out the interactions at short distances. As a result, the scattering amplitudes calculated in superstring theory are expected to be finite at all energies, without the need for the ad-hoc procedure of regularization. This property is often referred to as \"UV completeness.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nQuantum Chromodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics are quantum field theories that are well-known to require regularization to handle high-energy divergences. Classical Electrodynamics also contains an infinite self-energy problem for point charges, indicating a breakdown at high energies. Superstring Theory is specifically proposed as a theory that is finite at high energies and therefore would not require regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
