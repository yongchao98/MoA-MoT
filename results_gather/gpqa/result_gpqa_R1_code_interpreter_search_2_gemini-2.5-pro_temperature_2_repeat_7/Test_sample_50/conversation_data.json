    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. \"Grounded\" means the sphere is held at a constant potential of V = 0. The charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere is the same as if the sphere were replaced by a single \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The values of the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n    *   The image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is:\n        `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   The position of the image charge is:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As we bring the charge `q` in, it's acted upon by a force from the induced charge on the sphere. Using the method of images, this force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method 1: Integrating the force**\n    The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force between it and its image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2` (This is an attractive force).\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n    `U = W_ext = - integral from infinity to d of F(x) dx`\n    `U = - integral from infinity to d of [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * integral from infinity to d of [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`. The integral becomes `(1/2) * integral(u^-2 du) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`.\n\n    Evaluating the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))]` from infinity to `d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2 * (inf^2 - R^2)))]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method 2: Using the potential**\n    A simpler and more elegant method recognizes that the potential energy of a system assembled this way is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. Here, `V_induced` is the potential at the final location of charge `q` created by all other charges (i.e., the induced charge on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge itself changes as `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\n    *   The potential at location `d` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-R/d * q) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    *   Simplify the denominator: `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   Now, calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Both methods yield the same result. The potential energy is negative, which makes sense because the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - Correct\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n    D) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
