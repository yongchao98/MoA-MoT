    "This is an annihilation process where a proton and a slowly moving antiproton are converted into four new particles. We need to find the velocity of these new particles.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nThe fundamental principle we'll use is the conservation of total energy. The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in physics problems, implying that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We will assume the initial kinetic energy of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is approximately 938.3 MeV/cÂ². The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Since the initial system was effectively at rest (zero momentum), the total momentum of the final system must also be zero (Conservation of Momentum). By symmetry, the available energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles. This means each particle will have the same total energy, $E_A$, and the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**4. Solving for Velocity (v)**\n*   Now we equate the initial and final energies:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n*   We can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n*   Plugging in the given values:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity, $v$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThis can also be computed using a script for better precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.27208816 \n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Total initial energy (rest energy of proton and antiproton)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy is 4 times the energy of one A particle\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# From conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# So, gamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2) = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\ngamma = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Relationship between gamma and beta (v/c)\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - beta^2)\n# 1 - beta^2 = 1 / gamma^2\n# beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))\nbeta = np.sqrt(beta_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{beta=}\")\n```\nExecution output:\n```\nbeta=0.768656157124971\n```\n\nThe calculated value of $v/c$ is approximately 0.769, which rounds to 0.77. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is an annihilation process where mass is converted into energy, which then manifests as the mass and kinetic energy of new particles. The core principle to solve this problem is the **conservation of total relativistic energy**.\n\n**1.

Solving for Velocity (v)**\n\n*   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n*   Substitute the given values:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n*   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, expressed as $\\beta = v/c$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2} \\implies 1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
