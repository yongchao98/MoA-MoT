    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). The total mass is the sum of the masses of the two stars in the system.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definition of radial velocity, is:\n    M = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ((K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i))\n    Where:\n    *   M is the total mass of the system.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   'i' is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Interpret Key Information:** The problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses\". An eclipsing binary system means that the stars pass in front of each other from our perspective. This can only happen if the inclination 'i' is very close to 90 degrees. When i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass formula significantly. We can assume sin(i) ≈ 1 for both systems.\n\n4.  **Establish the Proportionality:** With sin(i) = 1 and 2πG being a constant, the total mass M is directly proportional to the product of the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n    M ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Organize the Data:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes (K1_total) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes (K2_total) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2. Using the proportionality from step 4:\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:** Substitute the values into the ratio equation. Note that as long as the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are consistent between the two systems, they will cancel out correctly.\n\n    M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to option C.\n\nTo be certain, let's perform the calculation using a python script.\n```python\n# Data for system_1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5   # km/s\n\n# Data for system_2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# For an eclipsing binary system, the total mass M is proportional to P * (Ka + Kb)^3\n# We need to find the ratio M1 / M2\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses\n# The constant of proportionality cancels out in the ratio\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_total)**3) / (P2 * (K2_total)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe code confirms the result of the calculation is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
