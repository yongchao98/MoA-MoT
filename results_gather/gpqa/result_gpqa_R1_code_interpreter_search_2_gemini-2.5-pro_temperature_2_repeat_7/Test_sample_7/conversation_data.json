    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Single Mutant Phenotypes**\nFirst, let's understand the role of each gene individually by looking at the knock-out mutants. The wild-type (WT) resistance is our 100% control baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of G1 causes a 25% drop in resistance (100% - 75%). This means G1 contributes to resistance, but it's not the most critical component.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for the resistance pathway. It could be a master regulator or a crucial component that the entire process depends on.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of G3 causes a 50% drop in resistance (100% - 50%). This means G3 is more important for resistance than G1, but not as critical as G2.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis and Gene Pathways**\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. In a genetic pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to a downstream gene. The phenotype of the double mutant will be the same as the phenotype of the mutant for the upstream gene.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant (0% resistance):**\n    *   Phenotype of g1: 75%\n    *   Phenotype of g2: 0%\n    *   Phenotype of g1g2: 0%\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (`g1g2`) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1 in the pathway.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant (0% resistance):**\n    *   Phenotype of g2: 0%\n    *   Phenotype of g3: 50%\n    *   Phenotype of g2g3: 0%\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (`g2g3`) is also identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G3.\n\n*   **Conclusion about G2:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and we know one gene is an upstream transcription factor, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. The genetic pathway model would look like this: G2 acts as a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.\n\n    Pathway Model:\n          --> G1 --\\\n    G2 --|          --> Resistance\n          --> G3 --/\n\n**3. Analyze the Interaction between G1 and G3**\nNow let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant to understand the relationship between these two downstream genes.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant (10% resistance):**\n    *   The loss from WT for g1 is 25%.\n    *   The loss from WT for g3 is 50%.\n    *   If their effects were purely additive (i.e., they acted in completely independent ways), the expected loss for the double mutant would be 25% + 50% = 75%, leading to 25% remaining resistance.\n    *   However, the actual resistance is only 10%, meaning a loss of 90%. This effect is more severe than the sum of the individual effects. This phenomenon is called **synergistic interaction** or synthetic enhancement. It suggests that G1 and G3 have functions that are partially overlapping or compensatory. While each provides a significant contribution, the system is much more robust when both are present. This relationship can be described as **partial gene redundancy**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis**\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct, as determined by our epistasis analysis.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. Their synergistic interaction is a form of partial redundancy, where they contribute to the same overall function.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. For G1 to be epistatic, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should match the `g1` phenotype (75%), which it does not.\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. The `g1` mutant has the mildest phenotype, making it an unlikely master regulator.\n    *   This option is definitively wrong.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple distinct traits. The experiment only measures resistance, so we have no evidence for pleiotropy. \"Gene redundancy\" is a better description of their interaction *within* this trait.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect, as explained for option A.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: Cannot be concluded from this data. They are co-regulated by G2, but could have separate promoters.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A provides the most accurate description of the experimental results, even with a flawed third statement.\n1.  It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor.\n2.  It uses the term \"gene redundancy\" which is the most plausible description for the synergistic interaction observed between G1 and G3 among the given choices.\n3.  The final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect, but the other options contain more significant errors (e.g., misidentifying the transcription factor or making claims that are completely unsupported by the data). Therefore, Option A is the best available answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
