    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the most effective mutation:\n\n**1. The Goal**\n\nThe primary objective is to eliminate the function of a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to achieve this is by introducing a mutation that prevents the cell from producing a complete, functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Types of Mutations**\n\nWe need to identify the mutation that is most likely to \"knock out\" the gene's function. Let's consider the likely impact of different mutation types:\n\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in a severely shortened and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very strong candidate for gene knockout.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence downstream from the mutation. This also typically leads to a premature stop codon and a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** This changes one codon, resulting in a single amino acid substitution. The impact can vary greatly. If the new amino acid has similar properties or is in a non-critical part of the protein, the function might be unaffected. Only some missense mutations lead to a loss of function.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides divisible by three (e.g., deleting a whole codon). This removes or adds one or more amino acids. While this can be disruptive, the rest of the protein is synthesized correctly, and it might retain some or all of its function.\n*   **Silent Mutation:** Changes a codon to another that codes for the same amino acid. This has no effect on the protein sequence.\n\n**3. Evaluating Each Mutant Sequence**\n\nWe will compare each mutant sequence to the intact gene, grouping the DNA into three-letter codons starting with `ATG` (the start codon).\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence & Protein:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   Protein: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine ...\n\n*   **Mutant 1 Analysis:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). There is also a silent mutation in the second codon (`TTT` -> `TTC`, both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   Type: **Missense mutation**.\n    *   Outcome: The protein will have one amino acid swapped (Leucine for Tyrosine). This *might* disrupt function, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 Analysis:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Type: **Nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a STOP codon.\n    *   Outcome: The synthesis of the protein will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product will be only two amino acids long (Methionine-Phenylalanine). This protein will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 Analysis:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison: There are two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   Type: **Two missense mutations.**\n    *   Outcome: The protein will have two amino acids swapped. This is more disruptive than one change, but still doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 Analysis:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted.\n    *   Type: **One missense mutation and one in-frame deletion.**\n    *   Outcome: The protein has one amino acid changed and is missing another. This could be very disruptive, but since the reading frame is maintained, the rest of the protein is synthesized correctly and might retain some function.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the outcomes, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most reliable and direct way to eliminate the protein's function. By introducing a STOP codon very early in the sequence, it ensures that no functional protein can be produced. The other mutations alter the protein but carry a higher risk that some residual function might remain. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the change most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
