    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:** The question revolves around the concept of the **mean free path (MFP)**, denoted by λ. The MFP is the average distance a particle travels between consecutive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the **collision cross-section**, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents for a collision. A larger cross-section means a collision is more likely.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:** The problem presents two different scenarios for calculating the mean free path within the same sample compartment.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1 (λ₁): Mean free path of gas molecules.**\n        *   **Collision Type:** A gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n        *   **Particles:** These are neutral atoms or molecules moving due to thermal energy.\n        *   **Governing Interaction:** The collisions are governed by short-range interatomic/intermolecular forces, often modeled as \"hard-sphere\" collisions. The collision cross-section (σ_gg) is related to the physical, geometric size of the molecules.\n        *   **Formula:** For gas-gas collisions, we account for the relative motion of all particles. This introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n          λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (λ₂): Mean free path of electrons.**\n        *   **Collision Type:** A high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n        *   **Particles:** A fast-moving electron (1000 keV) and a comparatively stationary gas molecule. Because the electron's velocity is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecule, we can treat the gas molecule as a fixed target.\n        *   **Governing Interaction:** The collision is an electrostatic (Coulomb) interaction. The negatively charged electron is scattered by the electromagnetic field of the gas molecule (the positive nucleus and the surrounding electron cloud). This force is long-range. The electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the molecule; it only needs to pass close enough to be deflected significantly.\n        *   **Formula:** Since the target is effectively stationary, the √2 factor is not used.\n          λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n          where `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   The key difference between the two scenarios is the nature of the collision and, therefore, the size of the collision cross-section.\n    *   The electrostatic field of an atom extends well beyond its physical radius. An incoming electron can be scattered by this field from a considerable distance.\n    *   A neutral gas molecule interacting with another neutral molecule requires a much closer approach for a significant interaction (a \"collision\") to occur.\n    *   Therefore, the effective target area for an electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly **larger** than the effective target area for another gas molecule (`σ_gg`).\n    *   So, we can conclude: **σ_eg > σ_gg**.\n\n4.  **Relate the Cross-Sections back to the Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   We have the two formulas:\n        *   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        *   λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   The number density `n` of gas molecules is the same in both cases, as the temperature and vacuum conditions did not change.\n    *   Let's compare λ₂ to λ₁.\n        *   λ₂ is inversely proportional to `σ_eg`.\n        *   λ₁ is inversely proportional to `σ_gg`.\n    *   Since `σ_eg` is significantly larger than `σ_gg`, it follows that `λ₂` must be **smaller** than `λ₁`.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The mean free path for an electron traveling through the residual gas (λ₂) is shorter than the mean free path for a gas molecule traveling through the same gas (λ₁). This is because the long-range electrostatic interaction provides a much larger effective target (collision cross-section) for the electron than the short-range kinetic interaction does for the gas molecule.\n\n    *   Therefore, **λ₂ < λ₁**.\n\nThis corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
