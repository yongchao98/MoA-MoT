    "*   **Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n        *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone), NaCN (sodium cyanide), and an unknown reagent A.\n        *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n        *   **Transformation:** The reaction involves the addition of a hydrogen atom (H) to the carbonyl oxygen and a cyanide group (CN) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This is a characteristic reaction for the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n        *   **Mechanism:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by a proton source to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH). Reagent A must therefore be a proton source. Among the given options for A (H3O+ and NaHSO3), H3O+ (hydronium ion from an acid in water) is a suitable proton source. NaHSO3 is incorrect; it is used for forming bisulfite adducts, a different reaction. Thus, **A = H3O+**.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the second reaction:**\n        *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (an α-hydroxy nitrile).\n        *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid).\n        *   **Transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, typically with heating. The reaction is shown to proceed with reagent B in the presence of water (H2O). This points to an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Among the options for B (HCl and CH3COOH), HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for nitrile hydrolysis. CH3COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective for this transformation. Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n    3.  **Combine the findings:**\n        *   We have determined that A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n        *   This combination matches option A.\n\n*   **Final conclusion:**\n    The first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which requires a nucleophilic cyanide source (NaCN) and a proton source (H3O+) for the final protonation step. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which is typically carried out using a strong acid like HCl in water.\n\n<<<A>>>"
