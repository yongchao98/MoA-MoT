    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) equal to 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF<sub>n</sub>. The mass fraction of fluorine can be expressed as:\n\nɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\nwhere Ar(F) is the atomic mass of fluorine (≈ 18.998 g/mol) and Ar(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for Ar(Y):\n0.3196 = (n × 18.998) / (Ar(Y) + n × 18.998)\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) + 0.3196 × n × 18.998 = n × 18.998\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) = n × 18.998 × (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) = n × 18.998 × 0.6804\nAr(Y) = n × (18.998 × 0.6804 / 0.3196)\nAr(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe now test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for an element Y that is known to form at least five binary fluorides.\n\n*   n = 1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest is Ca at 40.08 g/mol, which does not fit the chemical properties described).\n*   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Closest are Br at 79.9 g/mol and Se at 78.97 g/mol).\n*   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest is Sb at 121.76 g/mol).\n*   n = 4: Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No stable element fits well).\n*   n = 5: Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest are Hg at 200.59 g/mol and Tl at 204.38 g/mol).\n*   n = 6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Closest is Pu at 244 g/mol).\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical %F for the best candidates:\n*   **For A2 = PuF<sub>6</sub>**: %F = (6 × 18.998) / (244 + 6 × 18.998) = 113.988 / 357.988 = 31.84%. (Error ≈ 0.12%)\n*   **For A2 = SbF<sub>3</sub>**: %F = (3 × 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 × 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 = 31.88%. (Error ≈ 0.08%)\n\nBoth Plutonium (Pu) and Antimony (Sb) are excellent numerical fits. Let's analyze the other clues.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Candidates (Pu vs. Sb)**\n\n1.  **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    *   **Pu:** PuF<sub>3</sub>, PuF<sub>4</sub>, PuF<sub>5</sub>, PuF<sub>6</sub> are known. The existence of a fifth binary compound is plausible (e.g., gas-phase PuF or a hypothetical higher fluoride).\n    *   **Sb:** SbF<sub>3</sub> and SbF<sub>5</sub> are the main binary compounds. Polymeric forms like (SbF<sub>5</sub>)<sub>n</sub> and complex anions exist but referring to five distinct *binary compounds* is a stretch.\n\n2.  **\"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (...) and fluorine.\" (A1 → A2 + F<sub>2</sub>)**\n    *   **If Y=Pu, A2=PuF<sub>6</sub>.** The reaction would be A1 → PuF<sub>6</sub> + F<sub>2</sub>, implying A1 is a higher fluoride like PuF<sub>8</sub>. While unknown, its existence as a highly unstable, reactive intermediate could be a premise in a complex problem. PuF<sub>6</sub> itself is a reddish-brown solid. This fits \"bright-red\" reasonably well for substance A1.\n    *   **If Y=Sb, A2=SbF<sub>3</sub>.** The reaction would be A1 → SbF<sub>3</sub> + F<sub>2</sub>, implying A1 is SbF<sub>5</sub>. However, SbF<sub>5</sub> is colorless and is very thermally stable; it does not decompose into SbF<sub>3</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> at room temperature. This is a major contradiction.\n\n3.  **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"**\n    *   **If A1=PuF<sub>8</sub> (hypothetical):** It would be an extremely powerful oxidizing agent, certainly capable of oxidizing Xenon. (PuF<sub>6</sub> itself can). This fits.\n    *   **If A1=SbF<sub>5</sub>:** SbF<sub>5</sub> is a powerful Lewis acid and a strong oxidizer, but its ability to oxidize Xenon under normal conditions without activation (like UV light) is less straightforward than for a very high-oxidation state fluoride.\n\n4.  **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**\n    *   **If Y=Pu:** `Pu + A4 → A5`. The reaction would take place in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A4 would have to be a plutonium fluoride. However, all plutonium fluorides (PuF<sub>3</sub>, PuF<sub>4</sub>, PuF<sub>6</sub>) are colored solids. A \"colorless... solution of A4\" creates a severe contradiction.\n    *   **Let's rethink:** What if \"colorless solution\" refers to the solvent, and A4 is the solute which is dissolved in a solvent like anhydrous HF, and it's the solvent which is colorless? And maybe A4 itself is colorless, just not in solid state? This seems overly complex. It's more likely that the plutonium scenario is incorrect despite the good numerical fit. The \"colorless solution\" clue is the strongest argument against Pu.\n\nThis re-evaluation points away from Pu due to the color contradiction. Given the high precision of the mass fraction value, it's possible the information about the color or stability of antimony compounds in the problem description is either stylized or refers to less common conditions. But let's check for other elements that may fit the description. Bromine (Br) is a strong candidate for an element forming multiple fluorides (BrF, BrF3, BrF5).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Bromine (Br) as Element Y**\n\n*   **Y = Br**, Ar = 79.904 g/mol.\n*   Let's check the mass fraction again for n=2. Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9.\n    *   %F in BrF<sub>2</sub> doesn't exist as a stable molecule. Let's try A2=BrF.\n    *   %F in **BrF**: (18.998) / (79.904 + 18.998) = 18.998 / 98.902 = **19.21%**. Not a match.\n    *   Let's try A2=BrF<sub>3</sub>. %F = 41.6%. No. Let's try A2=BrF<sub>5</sub>. %F=54.3%. No.\n    *   There is an error in our initial analysis for Bromine with n=2. Ar(Y)≈80.9. Let's find n for Bromine (Ar=79.9): 79.9 ≈ 40.45n => n ≈ 1.97. This is very close to n=2. So why doesn't BrF2 fit? A2 = YF<sub>n</sub>. Perhaps A2 is not a simple BrF<sub>n</sub> molecule? This is getting too complicated.\n\nLet's go back to Pu being the most likely answer despite the color problem. A common feature of chemistry puzzles is that one clue may be misleading or require lateral thinking. If we assume the \"colorless solution\" refers to the solvent (e.g., anhydrous HF), the rest of the puzzle might work.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Puzzle Assuming Y = Pu**\n\n*   **Y = Pu**. The five binary compounds are A1 to A5.\n*   **A2 = PuF<sub>6</sub>** (%F = 31.84%, very close to 31.96%).\n*   **A1** decomposes to PuF<sub>6</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>, so **A1 = PuF<sub>8</sub>** (hypothetical, unstable, bright-red, strong oxidizer).\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorinating Pu and can oxidize Xe. This could also be **PuF<sub>6</sub>**. Pu + 3F<sub>2</sub> → PuF<sub>6</sub>.\n*   **A4 & A5** are involved in the reaction: `Pu + A4 --(1:1)--> A5` in a hot solution.\n*   This must be a comproportionation reaction, where plutonium in oxidation state 0 reacts with plutonium in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state (in A5).\n    *   `Pu(0) + Pu(VI)F_x → ...`\n    *   `Pu(0) + Pu(IV)F_x → ...`\n*   The known plutonium fluorides are PuF<sub>3</sub>, PuF<sub>4</sub>, PuF<sub>6</sub>. A4 and A5 must be two of these. Let's try combinations with a 1:1 molar ratio of Pu to A4.\n    *   **Hypothesis 1:** `Pu(0) + PuF_6 → ...` PuF<sub>6</sub> is A2 and A3. So A4 cannot be PuF<sub>6</sub> if A4 is a distinct compound. Let's assume the five compounds (A1-A5) are all different.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2:** `Pu(0) + A4 (PuF_4) → A5 (...)`  This reaction doesn't make sense as a 1:1 comproportionation to a single product. 2 Pu + 2 PuF4 -> no simple 1:1 product.\n    *   **A key comproportionation reaction for actinides is:** Metal + Hexafluoride → Tetrafluoride. For Uranium: U + 2UF<sub>6</sub> → 3UF<sub>4</sub>. The stoichiometry is not 1:1.\n    *   **Let's check the plutonium system:** A known reaction is `Pu(0) + PuF_4 → 2PuF_3` if Pu is in excess, and also the reaction of plutonium hydride with PuF<sub>4</sub>.\n    *   Consider another key reaction: `2Pu(0) + PuF_6 → 3PuF_4`. This also does not have 1:1 stoichiometry for `Pu:A4`.\n    *   There must be another reaction. What about `Pu + A4 -> A5` where A4 is an acid in solution? e.g., A4 is PuF<sub>6</sub> dissolved in something that participates. This contradicts A4 being a binary compound.\n\nLet's re-read \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". It does NOT say `Y + A4 -> A5`. It says adding Y to a solution of A4 yields A5. This could be Y + Solvent -> A5, with A4 acting as a catalyst. But that makes no sense. The most direct reading is `Pu + A4 -> A5`.\n\nThere seems to be a major flaw in every analytical path. Let's reconsider the least contradictory path: Y=Pu, and the problem writer made a mistake about the color of the \"solution of A4\". Let's assume A4 is a solid plutonium fluoride, and the reaction proceeds in a suitable (colorless) medium like anhydrous HF.\nWe need a 1:1 reaction `Pu + PuF_n → PuF_m`.\n`Pu(0) + Pu(VI)F_6 → ...` doesn't balance to a single product in 1:1 ratio.\n`Pu(0) + Pu(IV)F_4 → ...` doesn't balance to a single product in 1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's reconsider the wording. `molar ratio 1:1`. Does it mean Pu and A4 react in 1:1 ratio or Pu is added in a 1:1 ratio to the moles of A4 present in the solution? This implies the reaction consumes them in 1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's look at the problem from the end. We need the MW of A4. The choices are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 160-180, D) 110-130.\nIf Y=Pu, the molar masses are:\nPuF<sub>3</sub>: 244 + 3(19) = 301 g/mol\nPuF<sub>4</sub>: 244 + 4(19) = 320 g/mol\nPuF<sub>6</sub>: 244 + 6(19) = 358 g/mol\nNone of these fall into any of the ranges. This definitively rules out **Plutonium**.\n\nThere must be another element. Let's re-examine our initial Ar(Y) calculation.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45n.\n*   n=3: Ar(Y)≈121.35. Candidate Sb (121.76).\n    *   SbF<sub>3</sub> MW = 121.76 + 3(19) = 178.76. Range C (160-180).\n    *   SbF<sub>5</sub> MW = 121.76 + 5(19) = 216.76. Outside the ranges.\n*   n=4: Ar(Y)≈161.8. Candidate could be Te(127.6) if n is wrong, or Tb(158.9) but chemistry is wrong. What if the element is **Technetium (Tc)**, Ar ≈ 98.\n    *   %F in TcF<sub>6</sub> = (6*19)/(98+114) = 114/212 = 53.7%. No.\n    *   %F in TcF<sub>5</sub> = (5*19)/(98+95) = 95/193 = 49.2%. No.\nLet's trust the numerical fit for Sb (A2=SbF<sub>3</sub>). The contradictions about color and stability of A1=SbF<sub>5</sub> might be deliberate misinformation in a tricky problem.\nLet's assume **Y=Sb**.\n*   A2 = SbF<sub>3</sub>. MW = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   A1 = SbF<sub>5</sub>. MW = 216.76 g/mol.\n*   Five compounds? SbF<sub>3</sub>, SbF<sub>5</sub>, and perhaps some adducts or cluster ions like [Sb<sub>2</sub>F<sub>11</sub>]<sup>-</sup> etc. are known.\n*   Reaction `Sb + A4 --(1:1)--> A5` in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A4 and A5 must be binary antimony fluorides. The known ones are SbF<sub>3</sub> and SbF<sub>5</sub>.\n    *   The only possible comproportionation reaction involving the element and its fluorides is `Element + Higher Fluoride → Lower Fluoride`.\n    *   `Sb(0) + Sb(V)F_5 → Sb(III)F_3`.\n    *   Let's balance it: `2Sb + 3SbF_5 → 5SbF_3`. The ratio is 2:3, not 1:1.\n    *   This invalidates the Antimony hypothesis as well based on the final reaction.\n\nLet's go back and reconsider all clues. The problem has significant internal contradictions if we assume standard chemical facts. Let's revisit Iodine, Y=I, Ar=126.9.\n%F in IF<sub>3</sub> = 31.0%. It's a possible, but not great fit.\nM(IF) = 145.9 -> Range A\nM(IF<sub>3</sub>) = 183.9 -> Range C\nM(IF<sub>5</sub>) = 221.9 -> Range B\nM(IF<sub>7</sub>) = 259.9\nIf Iodine is the element, then A4 is one of its fluorides, and its molar mass falls in one of the ranges.\nLet's re-read the reaction: `Y + A4 --(1:1)--> A5`.\nA possible comproportionation is `I_2 + IF_7 → ...`. But I2 is the element Y, not I. `I(elemental form) + A4 → A5`. Maybe `I(s) + IF3(l) -> ...`.\nAnother comproportionation: `I2 + 6 IF5 --(in MeCN)--> 5 I2F4+ IF5·I` ... not a 1:1 reaction giving one product.\nThe reaction `3 I_2 + IF_5 + 5 AgF -> 5 AgI + IF_7` is not relevant.\n\nWhat if Y = Iodine, A4 = IF5 and A5 = IF? And the reaction is `2I2 + IF5 --> 5IF` ? That works out elementally, ratio 2:1. Not 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a single candidate whose molecular weight fits into one of the options AND which fits the description of A2.\nIf **A2 = SbF<sub>3</sub>**, its molecular weight is **178.76 g/mol**.\nThe range C is **160-180 g/mol**.\nIt is highly likely that A4 is the same substance as A2, and the puzzle's complexity is designed to obscure this.\nLet's check if this is plausible:\n`Y(Sb) + A4(SbF_3) --(1:1)--> A5` in a solution of SbF3. This reaction seems unlikely. `Sb + SbF_3` does not readily react to form a new compound `A5`.\nHowever, if we focus on the only solid numerical data:\n- A2 has ɷF=31.96%\n- The best fit is A2 = SbF<sub>3</sub> (%F=31.88%).\n- The molecular weight of SbF<sub>3</sub> is 178.76 g/mol.\n- This falls squarely in the range C) 160-180.\nIf we assume that **A4 is the same as A2**, then the answer would be C. The remaining parts of the text describe complex and possibly obscure or misrepresented reactions involving the other fluorides (A1, A3, A5), intended to confuse, while the identity of the most well-defined compound (A2) is the key. Given the contradictions in all other interpretations, this seems to be the most logical way to approach the problem: trust the primary quantitative data and find the most direct link to the answer choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
