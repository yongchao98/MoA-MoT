    "The user wants me to identify the immunological process occurring based on a described experiment.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the information provided:\n1.  **Antigen:** GFP-tagged rotavirus inner capsid proteins.\n2.  **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal tract.\n3.  **Location of response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut (Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue or GALT). The fluorescence indicates the antigen has reached these structures.\n4.  **Cell population:** Proliferating cells are isolated. In secondary lymphoid organs, antigen exposure triggers the proliferation of specific lymphocytes (B cells and T cells).\n5.  **Genetic analysis:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene shows \"high variability.\" The variable heavy chain (Vh) is a key component of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies they produce. It determines antigen specificity.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of this information:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the primary diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of naive B cells from hematopoietic stem cells. The process described in the question is an active immune response to an antigen in a mature animal, taking place in a *secondary* lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch), not the primary lymphoid organ (bone marrow). Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs *after* a B cell has been activated by an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ. Inside specialized structures called germinal centers (which form in places like Peyer's patches), these activated, proliferating B cells undergo SHM. This process introduces random point mutations specifically into the variable regions of their immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different B-cell receptors, some of which may bind the antigen with higher affinity. The \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a Peyer's patch is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n*   **C) complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (though it can be activated by antibodies from the adaptive system). It involves a cascade of serum proteins that help to opsonize pathogens, induce inflammation, and form a membrane attack complex. It does not involve any genetic changes to lymphocyte genes. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers, often concurrently with SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, IgG, or IgE) to change the effector function of the antibody, but it does not alter the antigen-binding site (the variable region). The question specifically states high variability was found in the *variable heavy chain gene*, which points directly to somatic hypermutation, not class switching.\n\nConclusion: The experimental observations—proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch showing high variability in the antigen-binding region (variable heavy chain) of their B-cell receptors in response to an antigen—are the defining characteristics of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
