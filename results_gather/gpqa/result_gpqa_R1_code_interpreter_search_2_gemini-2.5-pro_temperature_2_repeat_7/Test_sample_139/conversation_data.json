    "*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B.**\n    The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O or ²H₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    The value 277 K is a strong indicator that substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Substance G.**\n    Substance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated hydrate that decomposes upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which upon heating yields a metal oxide and D₂O (M(OD)ₓ → MₐOₙ + D₂O).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Gas W.**\n    Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's check common gases:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (p = n). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   N₂ (Nitrogen): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p = n).\n    *   O₂ (Oxygen): Each ¹⁶O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. The O₂ molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. (p = n).\n    *   CO (Carbon monoxide): ¹²C has 6p, 6n. ¹⁶O has 8p, 8n. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p = n).\n    Given that heavy water (D₂O) is involved, D₂ is the most plausible identity for gas W.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify Substance X.**\n    Substance X has several key properties:\n    1.  It incorporates a heavier isotope (we know D is involved, so X contains Deuterium).\n    2.  It reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce gas W (likely D₂) and precipitate G.\n    3.  Its close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\n    4.  It reduces a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n    Let's consider common deuterated reagents. Lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent with a \"very close analog,\" sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The deuterated version, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits the description.\n    Let's test the reaction of X = LiAlD₄. For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, the other reactant (Y) must also be a source of deuterium. The most obvious choice is heavy water, Y = D₂O.\n\n    The reaction would be:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃(s) (G) + LiOD(aq) + 4 D₂(g) (W)\n\n    Let's check if this fits the clues:\n    *   **Reaction:** It's known that LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water, so LiAlD₄ would react violently with D₂O.\n    *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This matches.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** It produces aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a solid precipitate. This matches.\n    *   **Heating G:** When Al(OD)₃ is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (substance B). This matches.\n    *   **Keto acid reaction:** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH. LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups to alcohols:\n        R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n        The final product is a diol, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the final clue.\n\n    Therefore, Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the requested value.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We should use integer mass numbers for the calculation since the options are integers.\n    1.  **Identify elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D or ²H).\n    2.  **Identify lightest and heaviest:**\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number): Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number): Aluminium (Z=13).\n    3.  **Sum the masses:** The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        *   There is one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium. The main isotope is ²⁷Al, so its mass number is 27.\n        *   There are four atoms of the lightest element, Hydrogen. They are present as Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of 2. The total mass from these atoms is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    4.  **Calculate the cumulative sum:**\n        Sum = (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D)\n        Sum = 27 + (4 × 2)\n        Sum = 27 + 8\n        Sum = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
