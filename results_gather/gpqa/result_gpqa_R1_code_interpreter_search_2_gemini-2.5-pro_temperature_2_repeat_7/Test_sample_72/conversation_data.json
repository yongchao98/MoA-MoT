    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe two astronauts are moving in the same direction. The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. If object 1 has velocity $v_1$ and object 2 has velocity $v_2$ in the same reference frame, the velocity of object 1 as seen from object 2 is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7} c \\approx 0.142857 c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total relativistic energy of a single particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**For astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy of astronaut 1, $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate the energy of astronaut 2, $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_2 \\approx 2 \\times 1.732 mc^2 = 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the total energy, $E_{total}$:**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mcÂ²**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$, and the total energy is $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm1 = 2\nv1 = 0.6\nm2 = 3\nv2 = 0.5\n\n# Calculate relative speed\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factors\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n\n# Calculate individual energies\nE1 = gamma1 * m1\nE2 = gamma2 * m2\n\n# Calculate total energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations have been completed in the previous step, and the provided code execution has confirmed the results.\n\n**1. Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):**\nThe calculation using the Lorentz velocity transformation formula yielded:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857 c$\nThe code output confirms this, rounding to `0.14c`.\n\n**2. Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\nThe calculation for the total relativistic energy of the system yielded:\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\nThe code output confirms this, rounding to `5.96mc^2`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated values are $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
