    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe particle is a spin 1/2 particle, and its state can be described by a 2-component spinor. Initially, it is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B_initial = B \\hat{k}` (in the +Z direction). In quantum mechanics, \"aligned\" means the system is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The magnetic moment operator is proportional to the spin operator: `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator vector. The problem statement `mu (= gamma*Sz)` is likely a shorthand for this relationship, defining the constant of proportionality via its z-component `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS_z B`.\n*   The spin operator `S_z` for a spin-1/2 particle has two eigenstates: spin-up `|+z>` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2` and spin-down `|-z>` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`.\n*   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lowest energy state (the ground state) is spin-up, `|+z>`. So, the state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`, this is our initial vector.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_new = B \\hat{j}` (in the +Y direction). The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is:\n`H = -μ · B_new = -γS · (B \\hat{j}) = -γB S_y`.\n\n*   The spin-y operator `S_y` is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n*   So, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γB (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\nThe state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\nWe need to find the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is the expectation value `<μ_z(t)>`.\n`<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\nThere are several ways to calculate this. A very direct method is to use the general principle of two-level systems.\n\n### Method: Using Energy Eigenstates (The most insightful method)\n1.  The initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y`. To see how it evolves, we express it as a superposition of the eigenstates of `H`. The eigenstates of `H` are the same as the eigenstates of `S_y`.\n2.  The eigenvalues of `H` are found from the eigenvalues of `S_y` (which are `±ħ/2`):\n    *   `E_+ = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    *   `E_- = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n3.  The initial state `|+z>` can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of `S_y` (let's call them `|+y>` and `|-y>`). For instance, `|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> - i|-y>)`.\n4.  The state evolves in time as:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * e^(-iE_+t/ħ) |+y> - (i/√2) * e^(-iE_-t/ħ) |-y>`\n5.  When we calculate the expectation value of an operator `A` (like `S_z`) which is not diagonal in the energy basis, the calculation will involve cross-terms like `e^(-iE_+t/ħ) * e^(+iE_-t/ħ) = e^(i(E_- - E_+)t/ħ)`.\n6.  This term oscillates with an angular frequency `Ω = (E_- - E_+) / ħ`. This is the fundamental oscillation frequency for observables in a two-level system.\n7.  Let's calculate this frequency:\n    `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n8.  The angular frequency of oscillation is:\n    `Ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis frequency `Ω = γB` is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Alternative Method: Direct Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)\n1.  Calculate the time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) = exp(i γB t S_y / ħ)`.\n    `U(t) = exp(i (γBt/2) σ_y) = cos(γBt/2) * I + i * sin(γBt/2) * σ_y`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n    In matrix form: `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n2.  Calculate the state at time `t`: `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n3.  Calculate the expectation value `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²θ - sin²θ`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n4.  The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n5.  This is an oscillation of the form `A*cos(Ωt)`, where the angular frequency `Ω` is `γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods show that the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`. The question asks for this \"oscillation frequency.\" The given options are in units of angular frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
