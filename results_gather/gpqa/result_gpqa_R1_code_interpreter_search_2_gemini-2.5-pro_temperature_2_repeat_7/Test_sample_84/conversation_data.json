    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, i.e., $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    The problem states that the star is the same for both planets ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants) and that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n    We need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2 / a_1$). We can derive this from the information provided by the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star})}{a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle between the line of sight and the orbital plane's normal).\n\n    Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, meaning their inclinations ($i_1$ and $i_2$) are very close to 90°. Thus, we can assume $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$.\n\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_{star}^2} \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{a M_{star}}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Now we can compute the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2)}{K_2^2 M_{star}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1)}{K_1^2 M_{star}} \\right)}$\n\n    The terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ are constant and cancel out. As argued before, we can assume $\\sin^2(i_1) \\approx \\sin^2(i_2)$. This simplifies the ratio to:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratios of Mass and RV Amplitude**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** The problem gives $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$ and $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio:** The RV semi-amplitude, K, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. The relationship is $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n        Given $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n5.  **Substitute Values and Calculate the Final Ratio**\n    Now, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n    Finally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    To get the decimal value:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# M_p_ratio is M_p2 / M_p1\nM_p_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# K_ratio is K1 / K2, which is equal to delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# a_ratio is a2 / a1\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio = (M_p_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# T_eq_ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2, which is sqrt(a2/a1)\nT_eq_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(T_eq_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",

Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into our equations:\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
