    "An analysis of the molecules is required to determine whether they exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls have a single bond connecting two phenyl rings.\n    *   Rotation around this single bond can be restricted if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond, i.e., 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: nitro groups (-NO2) at C6 and C6', and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at C2 and C2'.\n    *   This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific twisted conformation.\n    *   This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. This type of chirality arising from hindered rotation is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   Because it is chiral, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To determine if it's chiral, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since C2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule does not have any chiral centers.\n    *   While the phenyl rings are twisted out of plane, creating a propeller-like shape that is technically chiral in a static state, the energy barrier for rotation is very low. This allows the two enantiomeric conformations to rapidly interconvert at room temperature.\n    *   This rapid interconversion (racemization) means the enantiomers cannot be isolated, and the compound is not optically active under normal conditions. Therefore, it is considered achiral for practical purposes and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct choice is the one that includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
