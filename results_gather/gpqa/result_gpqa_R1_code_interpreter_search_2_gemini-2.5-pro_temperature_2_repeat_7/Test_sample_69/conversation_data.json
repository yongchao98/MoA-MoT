    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical riddle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 to Identify Key Elements\n*   **Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n*   The hydrolysis of compound C yields the starting solid A, a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G).\n*   The fact that A is reformed suggests that A is a central, relatively inert component of C, likely a noble metal or a salt that does not react with the produced acids.\n*   The formation of two different acids points to the identity of the ligands in C. Let's consider pairs of common strong/weak acids:\n    *   H₂SO₄ (strong) / H₂S (weak): would require Sulfur in the ligands.\n    *   HCl (strong) / HNO₂ (weak): would require Chlorine and Nitrogen in the ligands.\n    *   **HCl (strong) / HF (weak):** This is a very common and classic pair. Hydrochloric acid is strong, while hydrofluoric acid is weak. This suggests the ligands in C are chloride and fluoride.\n\nLet's proceed with the hypothesis that **F is HCl** and **G is HF**. This implies C is a chloro-fluoro compound of A.\n\n### Step 2: Use Clue 1 and 3 to Identify Gas B\n*   **Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n*   If the ligands in C are chlorine and fluorine, then the reactant gas B must be the source of these elements.\n*   The simplest stable gas containing both chlorine and fluorine is **chlorine monofluoride (ClF)**.\n*   So, we can identify **B = ClF(g)**.\n*   The reaction is: A(s) + 8 ClF(g) → C(bright red). C is some complex or adduct of A with Cl and F, for example A(Cl)ₓ(F)y.\n\n### Step 3: Use Clue 4 to Identify Gas D and Solvent H\n*   **Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n*   Substituting B = ClF, the reaction is: D(g) + ClF(g) → H(solvent).\n*   D must be a simple gas that reacts 1:1 with ClF. Let's consider simple elemental gases.\n*   A plausible reaction is with fluorine gas (F₂).\n*   F₂(g) + ClF(g) → ClF₃(l)\n*   This is a known, balanced 1:1 reaction. The product, **chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃)**, is a liquid at just below room temperature (b.p. 11.75 °C) and is used as a powerful fluorinating agent and specialty solvent.\n*   This allows us to identify:\n    *   **D = F₂(g)**\n    *   **H = ClF₃(l)**\n\n### Step 4: Use Clue 2 to Identify the Hazardous Product E\n*   **Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n*   Substituting D = F₂, the reaction is: C + 2 F₂(g) → E\n*   C is a compound containing A, Cl, and F. It reacts with fluorine gas.\n*   The product E is described as \"extremely hazardous\".\n*   Many fluorine compounds are extremely hazardous. Looking at the species we've already identified, **ClF₃ (H)** is itself an extremely reactive and hazardous substance. It is plausible that the product E is the same compound as H. Often, such riddles use different letters for products of different reactions, even if the substance is the same.\n*   Alternatively, the reaction of C (a large complex) with F₂ could cause it to break down, producing ClF₃ as one of the products. \"Produces E\" does not necessitate E being the sole product.\n*   Therefore, the most logical candidate for E is **E = ClF₃**.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E\n*   We have identified E as **chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃)**.\n*   To find its molecular symmetry group, we first need to determine its 3D shape using VSEPR theory.\n*   The central atom is Cl. It has 7 valence electrons.\n*   It forms single bonds with 3 F atoms (3 electrons shared).\n*   Total electrons around Cl = 7 + 3 = 10 electrons = 5 electron pairs.\n*   The electron geometry for 5 pairs is trigonal bipyramidal.\n*   There are 3 bonding pairs (the F atoms) and 2 lone pairs.\n*   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions of the trigonal bipyramid.\n*   This results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n*   Now we identify the symmetry elements for a T-shaped molecule (like ClF₃):\n    1.  **E:** The identity element (all molecules have this).\n    2.  **C₂:** A two-fold rotation axis that passes through the Cl atom and the \"vertical\" F atom.\n    3.  **σᵥ (plane 1):** A mirror plane that contains all four atoms.\n    4.  **σ'ᵥ (plane 2):** A mirror plane perpendicular to the first, containing the Cl and the vertical F atom, and bisecting the angle between the two \"horizontal\" F atoms.\n*   The set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, σᵥ, σ'ᵥ} corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nLet's check the options given:\nA) D∞h\nB) C2\nC) C2v\nD) D4h\n\nOur derived point group, C₂v, matches option C."
