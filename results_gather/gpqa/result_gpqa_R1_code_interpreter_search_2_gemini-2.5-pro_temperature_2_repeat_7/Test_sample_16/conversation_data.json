    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium.** The problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$. The equilibrium reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$ ⇌ $Ca^{2+}$ + $EDTA^{4−}$\n\n2.  **Understand the given constant.** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+}$ + $EDTA^{4−}$ ⇌ $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4−}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the dissociation constant ($K_d$).** Since we are looking at the dissociation of the complex, it is more convenient to use the dissociation constant, $K_d$, which is the inverse of the formation constant, $K_f$.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4−}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}]}$\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.** We start with an initial concentration of the complex and assume it dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | $EDTA^{4−}$ |\n| :------------------ | :----------------- | :-------- | :---------- |\n| **Initial (I)**     | 0.02 M             | 0 M       | 0 M         |\n| **Change (C)**      | -x                 | +x        | +x          |\n| **Equilibrium (E)** | 0.02 - x           | x         | x           |\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression in terms of 'x'.**\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n6.  **Apply an approximation.** Because the dissociation constant ($K_d = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$) is extremely small, very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the equation by assuming $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n7.  **Solve for 'x'.** 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nKd = 2e-11\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# x^2 / initial_complex_conc = Kd\n# x^2 = Kd * initial_complex_conc\nx_squared = Kd * initial_complex_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n8.  **Final Result.** The calculation shows that the concentration of calcium ions, 'x', is approximately $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from a solution that initially contains a stoichiometric amount of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$.\n\n1.  **Define the Equilibrium Reaction**: We are interested in the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, which are formed when the complex dissociates. Therefore, the relevant equilibrium reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$ ⇌ $Ca^{2+}$ + $EDTA^{4−}$\n\n2.  **Determine the Equilibrium Constant**: The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$), which is for the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+}$ + $EDTA^{4−}$ ⇌ $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$\n    $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4−}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for our dissociation reaction is the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant ($K_f$):\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table**: We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations.

    "An initial concentration of 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is given. We need to find the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in this solution.\n\n**1. The Dissociation Equilibrium:**\nThe calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4−}$).
