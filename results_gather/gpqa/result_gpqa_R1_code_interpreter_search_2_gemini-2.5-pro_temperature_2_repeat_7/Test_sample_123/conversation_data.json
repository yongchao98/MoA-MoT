    "This problem requires us to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after a time 't' in a specific reference frame is given by the exponential decay law:\nN/N₀ = exp(-t / τ)\nwhere:\n*   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n*   N is the number of particles remaining.\n*   t is the time elapsed in the chosen reference frame.\n*   τ is the mean lifetime of the particles in that same reference frame.\n\n**2. Apply the Concepts to the Lab Frame**\n\nWe are observing the decay from the laboratory's reference frame.\n*   The time of flight (t_lab) for a particle to travel the detector radius (L = 30 m) is t_lab = L / v. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity (v) is very close to the speed of light (c). So, we can approximate t_lab ≈ L / c.\n*   The particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame (τ_lab) is dilated due to its high speed. It relates to the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (γ): τ_lab = γ * τ₀.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as:\nN/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = exp(-(L/c) / (γ * τ₀))\nThis can be rearranged as:\nN/N₀ = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ₀))\n\nThe term `c*τ₀` represents the average distance a particle would travel at the speed of light during its proper lifetime. This value is an intrinsic property of the particle and is constant. Let's call the constant term `L / (c * τ₀)` as a single constant `K`, since L is also fixed.\nSo, the governing equation is:\nN/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\n**3. Use the Initial Condition to find K**\n\nThe problem states that when the Lorentz factor (γ₁) is ~20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n*   γ₁ = 20\n*   (N/N₀)₁ = 1/3\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\nTo solve for K, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -K / 20\n-ln(3) = -K / 20\nK = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**4. Use K to find the New Lorentz Factor**\n\nNow we want to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows about two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to survive.\n*   (N/N₀)₂ = 2/3\n*   γ₂ = ?\n\nUsing the same governing equation:\n2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n\nSubstitute the value of K we found:\n2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\nln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nThe negative signs cancel out. We can also use the logarithm property ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b) and ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x).\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nNow, we solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nTo get the numerical answer, we can use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor for the first case\ngamma1 = 20.0\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor, gamma2, using the derived formula:\n# gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2) or gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n54.19083313233157\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 40\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe closest value is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after traveling a distance L is given by the formula derived from the principles of special relativity:\nN/N₀ = exp( -L / (γ * v * τ₀) )\n\nWhere:\n*   `L` is the distance traveled (the detector radius, 30 m).\n*   `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `v` is the particle's velocity.\n*   `τ₀` is the particle's proper mean lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\nSince the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So we can approximate `v ≈ c`. The equation becomes:\nN/N₀ = exp( -L / (γ * c * τ₀) )\n\nThe term `L / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\nSo, the governing equation is:\nN/N₀ = exp( -K / γ )\n\n**Step 1: Use the initial conditions to find the constant K.**\nWe are given that when γ₁ = 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles survive.\n1/3 = exp( -K / 20 )\n\nTo solve for K, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -K / 20\n-ln(3) = -K / 20\nK = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Step 2: Use K to find the new Lorentz factor.**\nNow we want to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, for which two-thirds (2/3) of the particles survive.\n2/3 = exp( -K / γ₂ )\n\nSubstitute the value of K we just found:\n2/3 = exp( -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂ )\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a), we can write ln(2/3) as -ln(3/2).\n-ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nThe negative signs on both sides cancel out:\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\nThe Python code execution confirms this calculation: `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`.\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
