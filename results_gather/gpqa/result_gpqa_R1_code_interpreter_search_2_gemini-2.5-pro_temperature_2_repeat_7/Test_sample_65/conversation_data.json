    "SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Lagrangian. These operators represent the low-energy effects of new physics at a scale Î› much higher than the electroweak scale. The construction of SMEFT is based on certain fundamental principles and symmetries. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is formulated as a relativistic quantum field theory. This means that the laws of physics it describes are independent of the observer's inertial reference frame. The operators added to the Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, ensuring that the theory as a whole respects Lorentz symmetry. This is a foundational assumption.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that also includes spacetime translations (invariance under shifts in time and space). Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a bedrock assumption in the construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian. Invariance under spacetime translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Since Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, if Poincare is respected, Lorentz is automatically respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably in the weak interactions involving quarks (the CKM matrix). SMEFT is designed to parameterize *all* possible effects of new physics consistent with the basic symmetries, and this includes potential *new sources* of CP violation. Therefore, many SMEFT operators are explicitly constructed to be CP-violating. A famous example is the CP-violating dimension-6 two-gluon operator G~G. Consequently, SMEFT operators are *not* required to respect CP symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** CPT symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). The **CPT theorem** is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is automatically CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Lorentz symmetry (1) **must** be respected.\n*   Poincare symmetry (2) **must** be respected.\n*   CP symmetry (3) is **not** required to be respected; SMEFT allows for CP violation.\n*   CPT symmetry (4) **must** be respected as a consequence of Lorentz invariance and locality.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that all operators in the SMEFT must respect are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
