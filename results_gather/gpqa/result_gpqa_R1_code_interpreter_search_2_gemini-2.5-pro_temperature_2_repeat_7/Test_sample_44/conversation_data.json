    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Basic Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this context, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin up (↑) and one with spin down (↓).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in this well is given by the formula:\n    `E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem conveniently defines a base energy unit `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. Therefore, the energy of a particle in level `n` simplifies to `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E₀)**\n\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy configuration. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    `E_ground = (2 particles * E_1) + (2 particles * E_2)`\n    `E_ground = 2 * (1E) + 2 * (4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E₁)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the smallest possible energy increase from the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   **New Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    `E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n    `E_1st_excited = 2 * (1²E) + 1 * (2²E) + 1 * (3²E)`\n    `E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E₂)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible single-particle and multi-particle excitations from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state and find the minimum among them.\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n    *   Energy = `1 * (1²E) + 2 * (2²E) + 1 * (3²E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3)`\n    *   Energy = `2 * (1²E) + 2 * (3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`\n\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4)`\n    *   Energy = `2 * (1²E) + 1 * (2²E) + 1 * (4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`\n\nComparing the energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest value is 18E. Therefore, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis result matches option A.\nI will use the following Python code to verify the calculations.\n```python\ndef calculate_energy(config):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the total energy for a particle configuration.\"\"\"\n    total_energy = 0\n    # config is a list where index i represents level n=i+1\n    # and the value is the number of particles in that level.\n    for n_minus_1, num_particles in enumerate(config):\n        n = n_minus_1 + 1\n        energy_level_n = n**2\n        total_energy += num_particles * energy_level_n\n    return total_energy\n\n# Ground State: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2\nground_config = [2, 2, 0, 0]\nground_energy = calculate_energy(ground_config)\n\n# First Excited State: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3\nfirst_excited_config = [2, 1, 1, 0]\nfirst_excited_energy = calculate_energy(first_excited_config)\n\n# Second Excited State Possibilities\n# A: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3\nconfig_A = [1, 2, 1, 0]\nenergy_A = calculate_energy(config_A)\n# B: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3\nconfig_B = [2, 0, 2, 0]\nenergy_B = calculate_energy(config_B)\n# C: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4\nconfig_C = [2, 1, 0, 1]\nenergy_C = calculate_energy(config_C)\n\nsecond_excited_energy = min(energy_A, energy_B, energy_C)\n\nprint(f\"Ground state energy: {ground_energy}E\")\nprint(f\"First excited state energy: {first_excited_energy}E\")\nprint(f\"Second excited state energy: {second_excited_energy}E\")\n\n# The list of energies is:\nprint(f\"Energies: {ground_energy}E, {first_excited_energy}E, {second_excited_energy}E\")\n```\n>>>\nGround state energy: 10E\nFirst excited state energy: 15E\nSecond excited state energy: 18E\nEnergies: 10E, 15E, 18E\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires understanding the behavior of fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n1.  **Particle Type:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state here is defined by both the energy level (quantum number *n*) and the spin state (spin-up or spin-down). Therefore, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n3.  **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`. So, the energy of a particle in level *n* is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\nLet's calculate the total energy for the ground and excited states by filling the energy levels from the bottom up.\n\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible total energy state.\n    *   Fill the n=1 level (Energy = 1²E = 1E). We can place 2 particles here.\n    *   Fill the n=2 level (Energy = 2²E = 4E). We place the remaining 2 particles here.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy** = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. It is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n    *   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2.\n    *   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (Energy = 3²E = 9E).\n    *   New configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy** = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:** This is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider the different possibilities to create an excitation from the ground state that has a higher energy than the first excited state.\n    *   **Possibility (a):** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = (1 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) + (1 × E_3) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n    *   **Possibility (b):** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_3) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   **Possibility (c):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n        *   Energy = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_4) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   The lowest energy among these possibilities is 18E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy** = **18E**.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
