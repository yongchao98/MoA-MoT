    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** We are told that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere. The number density `ρ` represents the number of stars per unit volume (e.g., stars per cubic parsec).\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = ρ * V`. Since `ρ` is a constant, the number of stars is directly proportional to the volume being considered.\n\n3.  **Consider a Shell of Stars:** We want to find the number of stars at a certain distance. It's easiest to think about this by considering all the stars within a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from us, with a small thickness `dd`.\n\n4.  **Volume of the Spherical Shell:** The volume of a sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`. The volume of our thin spherical shell, `dV`, can be found by taking the derivative of the sphere's volume with respect to its radius `d`, and multiplying by the thickness `dd`.\n    `dV = (d/dd)[(4/3)πd³] * dd = 4πd² * dd`.\n    Alternatively, one can think of it as the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thin thickness (`dd`).\n\n5.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars, `dN`, within this thin shell is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume of the shell `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n6.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question is about parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The relationship between parallax (in arcseconds) and distance (in parsecs) is `plx = 1/d`, which means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n7.  **Relate Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to substitute not only `d` but also the differential `dd` in our equation for `dN`. We can find the relationship by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `d/d(plx) [d] = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`.\n    Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    When considering the number of stars in a range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that as `d` increases, `plx` decreases). So, `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n8.  **Substitute into the Star Count Equation:** Now we take our equation for the number of stars in the shell, `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`, and replace the distance terms with parallax terms.\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`.\n    *   Replace `dd` with `(1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n    This gives us:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n9.  **Simplify the Expression:** Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n10. **Final Interpretation:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This quantity is precisely `dN / d(plx)`. We can rearrange our equation to find this:\n    `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n\n    Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `(Number of stars per unit parallax) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result shows that the number of stars we observe in a given parallax interval drops very steeply as the parallax itself gets smaller (i.e., as we look at more distant stars).\n\n<<<A>>>"
