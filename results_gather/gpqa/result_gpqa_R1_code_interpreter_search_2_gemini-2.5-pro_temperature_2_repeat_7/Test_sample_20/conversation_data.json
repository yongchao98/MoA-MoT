    "**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are all part of the carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, p-benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   This compound is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3 hybridized and are each bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha to two carbonyl groups. For example, C2 is alpha to both C1=O and C3=O.\n    *   These hydrogen atoms on C2, C4, and C6 are alpha-hydrogens. They are particularly acidic because the negative charge in the resulting conjugate base (enolate) can be delocalized over two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists predominantly in its aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A common source of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), the one bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and *will* show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   This molecule is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (also known as a center of inversion) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Molecules with a center of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and does not show optical isomerism. (It does show geometrical isomerism with its cis-isomer, dimethyl maleate).\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
