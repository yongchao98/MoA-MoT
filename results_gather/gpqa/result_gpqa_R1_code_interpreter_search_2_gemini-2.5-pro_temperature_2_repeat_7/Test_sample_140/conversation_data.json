    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine (Br) atom at position C1 and a deuterium (D) atom at position C2. The remaining positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, :NH2-), and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide like bromobenzene with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n    *   The mechanism involves two main steps:\n        a.  **Elimination:** The strong base removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the halide ion to form a carbon-carbon triple bond in the benzene ring, i.e., benzyne.\n        b.  **Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, the amide ion, :NH2-) attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia) to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n        The leaving group (Br) is at C1. The ortho positions are C2 (which has a deuterium, D) and C6 (which has a hydrogen, H). The amide base (:NH2-) can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of these positions.\n\n        *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:**\n            1.  The base abstracts the proton (H+) from C6.\n            2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n            *   *Note:* The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Therefore, the abstraction of H is faster than the abstraction of D, making this the **major** pathway.\n\n        *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:**\n            1.  The base abstracts the deuteron (D+) from C2.\n            2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed, this benzyne intermediate is non-deuterated (**benzyne**).\n            *   *Note:* Although slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, this pathway is still possible. The question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider it.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Addition (Formation of Final Products)**\n        The nucleophile :NH2- now adds to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent, NH3 (which contains H, not D).\n\n        *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n            This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the D is at C2. The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n            1.  **Attack at C1:** The :NH2- group adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6. This carbanion is then protonated by NH3. The final product has an -NH2 group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n            2.  **Attack at C6:** The :NH2- group adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1. This carbanion is protonated by NH3. The final product has an -NH2 group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. When we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n        *   **Products from Intermediate B (benzyne):**\n            This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne. The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n            1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the nucleophile attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation by NH3 will lead to the same product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), with no deuterium.\n\n4.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering all plausible mechanistic pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A, attack at C1)\n    3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A, attack at C6)\n\nNo other products, such as 4-deuteroaniline, are possible through this mechanism. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products."
