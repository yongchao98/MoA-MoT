    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n**1. Understand the Decay Process:**\n\nThe decay is given by:\nPi(+) → mu(+) + νμ\n\nWhere:\n*   Pi(+) is the positive pion.\n*   mu(+) is the positive muon.\n*   νμ is the muon neutrino.\n\nWe are given the rest masses:\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), m(Pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), m(mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n\nWe will assume the neutrino (νμ) is massless, as is common in such problems, so m(nu) = 0.\n\nThe Pi(+) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero and its initial kinetic energy is zero.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n\n*   **Initial momentum (p_initial):** Since the Pi(+) is at rest, p_initial = 0.\n*   **Final momentum (p_final):** After the decay, the mu(+) and nu fly off. To conserve momentum, they must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    p_final = p(mu) + p(nu)\n    0 = **p(mu)** + **p(nu)** => **p(mu)** = -**p(nu)**\n    This implies their momentum magnitudes are equal: |p(mu)| = |p(nu)| = p.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n\n*   **Initial energy (E_initial):** The Pi(+) is at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy.\n    E_initial = m(Pi)c² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    E_final = E(mu) + E(nu)\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\nm(Pi)c² = E(mu) + E(nu)\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    E(mu) = √[(p_mu * c)² + (m_mu * c²)²] = √[(pc)² + (105.7 MeV)²]\n*   For the massless neutrino (nu):\n    E(nu) = √[(p_nu * c)² + (0)²] = p_nu * c = pc\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: KE(nu) = E(nu) = pc.\n\nNow, substitute these into the energy conservation equation:\n139.6 MeV = √[(pc)² + (105.7 MeV)²] + pc\n\nTo solve for the momentum 'p', we rearrange the equation:\n139.6 - pc = √[(pc)² + 105.7²]\n\nSquare both sides:\n(139.6 - pc)² = (pc)² + 105.7²\n139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + 105.7²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out:\n19488.16 - 279.2 * (pc) = 11172.49\n\nNow, solve for pc:\n279.2 * (pc) = 19488.16 - 11172.49\n279.2 * (pc) = 8315.67\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.784 MeV\n\n**4. Calculate Kinetic Energies:**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE(nu)):**\n    As we established, for a massless particle, KE = E = pc.\n    KE(nu) = 29.784 MeV ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE(mu)):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy: KE = E - mc².\n    E(mu) = Total energy of the muon = E(initial) - E(nu) = 139.6 MeV - 29.784 MeV = 109.816 MeV.\n    KE(mu) = E(mu) - m(mu)c²\n    KE(mu) = 109.816 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    KE(mu) = 4.116 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n\n**Calculation Check using a direct formula:**\nA simpler way to calculate is to use the derived formulas for a two-body decay from rest:\nLet M = m(Pi) = 139.6 MeV/c², m₁ = m(mu) = 105.7 MeV/c², and m₂ = m(nu) = 0.\nThe kinetic energies of the products are:\nKE(mu) = [(M - m₁)²c⁴] / (2Mc²) = (M - m₁)² / (2M)\nKE(nu) = [(M² - m₁²)c⁴] / (2Mc²) = (M² - m₁²) / (2M)\n\nLet's compute the values:\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV/c^2\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV/c^2\n\n# Kinetic energy of the muon (mu+)\nke_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)**2 / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu)\nke_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+) = {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu = {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe execution of this code yields:\n```\nKE of mu(+) = 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu = 29.78 MeV\n```\nRounding to one decimal place for KE(nu) as in the options, we get 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **4.12 MeV** for the muon (mu+) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino (nu). This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ):\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n\nWe are given the rest masses (which can be treated as rest energies in MeV):\n*   Rest energy of π⁺, M_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of μ⁺, M_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (νμ) is assumed to be zero (M_νc² = 0).\n\nThe pion is stationary, so its initial kinetic energy is zero, and its initial momentum is zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\nLet `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\nE_initial = E_final\nM_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)² to express the energies of the products:\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ = √( (p_μc)² + (M_μc²)² ) = √( (pc)² + (105.7)² )\n*   For the neutrino (νμ), which is massless: E_ν = √( (p_νc)² + (0)² ) = p_νc = pc\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n139.6 = √( (pc)² + (105.7)² ) + pc\n\nTo solve for `pc` (the momentum-energy term), we rearrange and square the equation:\n139.6 - pc = √( (pc)² + (105.7)² )\n(139.6 - pc)² = (pc)² + (105.7)²\n139.6² - 2(139.6)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + 105.7²\n\nThe (pc)² terms on both sides cancel out:\n19488.16 - 279.2(pc) = 11172.49\n\nNow, we solve for pc:\n279.2(pc) = 19488.16 - 11172.49\n279.2(pc) = 8315.67\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy (KE = E - mc²).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.78 MeV ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_μ):**\n    First, find the total energy of the muon using the conservation of energy principle:\n    E_μ = E_initial - E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 29.78 MeV = 109.82 MeV\n    Now, calculate the kinetic energy:\n    KE_μ = E_μ - M_μc²\n    KE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = **4.12 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches the values in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
