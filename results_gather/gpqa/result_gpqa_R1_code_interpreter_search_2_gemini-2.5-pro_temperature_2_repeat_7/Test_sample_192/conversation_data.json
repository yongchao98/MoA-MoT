    "Here's a step-by-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (plx) and distance (r) are inversely related. The standard astronomical formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is the parallax angle in arcseconds. This means `r = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Translate the given information into a mathematical relationship.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This typically refers to the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx`.\n    So, we can write this proportionality as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance.**\n    We want to know how the number of stars changes with distance `r`. We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship (`plx = 1/r`) into our number-count equation:\n    `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    `N ∝ r⁵`\n    This tells us that the total (cumulative) number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Determine the quantity the question is asking for.**\n    The question asks for \"how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the number of stars within a small shell of distance, not the total cumulative number. In calculus terms, if `N(r)` is the total number of stars out to distance `r`, the question is asking for the derivative of `N` with respect to `r`, which is `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the density of stars at a given distance `r`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative.**\n    We have the relationship for the cumulative number of stars:\n    `N(r) ∝ r⁵`\n    Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n    `N(r) = k * r⁵`\n    Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r` to find the number of stars per unit range of distance:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5k * r⁴`\n    Since `5k` is just another constant, we can write the proportionality:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to the distance raised to the fourth power (`r⁴`).\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) ~ r³\nB) ~ r⁴\nC) ~ r²\nD) ~ r⁵\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
