    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   This anhydride has a highly symmetric structure, as indicated by its NMR spectra:\n            *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region. A single peak means the two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent.\n            *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). This means there are only two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n        *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4).\n        *   The four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) are each substituted with a methyl group.\n        *   The fifth carbon of the ring (C5) is a methylene group (CH₂).\n        *   Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   **Product Formula:** C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n    *   **Product Structure:** The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The dienophile adds across the C1 and C4 positions of the diene.\n        *   The new backbone is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.\n        *   There are methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) and on the vinyl carbons (C2, C3).\n        *   The original C5-methylene group of the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge of the product.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety is fused to C5 and C6 of the new bicyclic system.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers.\n        *   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" or *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is positioned \"away\" or *anti* to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products**\n\n    *   The **Alder Endo Rule** predicts that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically-favored product due to secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   **However**, in this specific case, the diene is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups on the carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n    *   An *endo* approach of the maleic anhydride would involve significant steric clash between the anhydride ring and the methyl groups on C2 and C3.\n    *   An *exo* approach is sterically much more favorable.\n    *   Therefore, this is a classic exception to the endo rule. The reaction is dominated by steric effects, not electronic effects.\n    *   **Major Product = Exo Adduct** (kinetically favored due to lower steric hindrance in the transition state).\n    *   **Minor Product = Endo Adduct**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n    *   A **2D NOESY** experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are J-coupled.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** and **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *Exo* adduct but far apart in the *Endo* adduct.\n\n5.  **Visualize the Isomers and Proton Proximities**\n\n    *   First, let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the products. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2=C3 bond, the C7 bridge, and the anhydride oxygen.\n        *   **Vinyl Methyls (on C2, C3):** Two equivalent CH₃ groups. Signal will be a **6H singlet**. Chemical shift will be deshielded due to the double bond (~1.5-2.0 ppm). Let's call this Signal V.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (on C1, C4):** Two equivalent CH₃ groups. Signal will be a **6H singlet**. Chemical shift will be typical for methyl on a quaternary sp³ carbon (~1.0-1.5 ppm). Let's call this Signal B.\n        *   **Anhydride Methine Protons (on C5, C6):** Two equivalent CH protons. Signal will be a **2H singlet** (no adjacent protons for coupling). Chemical shift will be highly deshielded due to being α to two carbonyls in a strained ring (~3-4 ppm). Let's call this Signal A.\n        *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (on C7):** Two non-equivalent CH protons, which would likely appear as two separate 1H doublets due to geminal coupling.\n\n    *   **Now, let's check distances:**\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C2=C3 double bond. This means the anhydride methine protons (H5, H6, Signal A) point *towards* the C2=C3 double bond and are therefore very close to the **vinyl methyl groups** (Signal V). A strong NOE is expected between Signal A and Signal V.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points towards the C2=C3 double bond. The anhydride methine protons (H5, H6, Signal A) point *away* from the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the vinyl methyl groups (Signal V). This NOE will be absent or very weak.\n\n6.  **Match the Prediction to the Options**\n\n    *   The differentiating cross-peak, present only in the major (exo) product, connects the anhydride methine protons (Signal A) and the vinyl methyl protons (Signal V).\n    *   Signal A: ~3-4 ppm, 2H singlet.\n    *   Signal V: ~1.5-2.0 ppm, 6H singlet.\n    *   Let's examine the options provided:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\n    *   Option B matches our prediction perfectly. The \"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\" corresponds to the vinyl methyls (Signal V), and the \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\" corresponds to the anhydride methine protons (Signal A).\n\n<<<B>>>"
