    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and its measurements:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The planet's gravitational pull causes the star to \"wobble\" in a small orbit around the system's barycenter. This wobble causes the star's light to be slightly redshifted as it moves away from us and blueshifted as it moves towards us.\n\n    The observed quantity is the periodic shift in wavelength (`Δλ`) of a spectral line. This wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`) along our line of sight:\n    `Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c`\n    where `λ₀` is the rest wavelength and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *amplitude* of this periodic wavelength shift. Therefore, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as `K`, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift `Δλ`.\n    *   For planet #1, `Δλ₁ = 5` mÅ, so `K₁ ∝ 5`.\n    *   For planet #2, `Δλ₂ = 7` mÅ, so `K₂ ∝ 7`.\n\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Relate the velocity amplitude (K) to orbital parameters:**\n    For a planet of mass `M_p` in a circular orbit around a star of mass `M_s`, the semi-amplitude `K` of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    `K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / ((M_s + M_p)^(2/3))`\n\n    Here:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The term `M_p * sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" that can be determined from RV measurements.\n    *   `M_s` is the mass of the star.\n    *   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression based on the problem statement:**\n    We can simplify the formula by analyzing the given information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_s1 = M_s2 = M_s`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: The measured quantity from the RV method is `M_p * sin(i)`. It is reasonable to assume that this measured \"minimum mass\" is what the problem refers to as being similar. Thus, `(M_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (M_p * sin(i))₂`.\n    *   Star masses are much larger than planet masses (`M_s >> M_p`, as it's a Sun-like star and a Neptune-like planet). Therefore, `(M_s + M_p) ≈ M_s`.\n\n    Applying these simplifications, the formula becomes:\n    `K ≈ ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_s^(2/3))`\n\n    Let's group the terms that are constant for both systems: `C = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_s^(2/3))`.\n    The relationship between `K` and `P` is then:\n    `K ≈ C * P^(-1/3)`\n    This shows that `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period `P`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:**\n    From the relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, we can write:\n    `P ∝ K⁻³`\n\n    We want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³`\n\n    We already established that `K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5`, which means `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n    Now, substitute this into the equation for the period ratio:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`\n\n5.  **Compute the final value:**\n    To get the numerical answer, we perform the division.\n    `125 / 343 ≈ 0.36443`\n\n    This value is approximately `0.36`, which matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation:\n```python\n# Calculate the cube of the ratio of the velocity amplitudes.\n# K1 corresponds to a 5 mÅ shift.\n# K2 corresponds to a 7 mÅ shift.\n# The ratio of periods P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n<<<C>>>"
