    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n*   This is a cyclohexanone (6-membered ring with a ketone at C1).\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is a prop-1-en-2-yl group, commonly known as an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship relative to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis, which is used here to protect the alcohol group.\n*   **Mechanism:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This forms a sodium alkoxide intermediate (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   The nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n*   **Reaction:** Formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Mechanism:** The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The nitrogen of the -NH₂ group acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. After a series of proton transfers and dehydration (loss of a water molecule), a C=N bond is formed. The HCl catalyst facilitates this process.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene. It effectively removes the original carbonyl oxygen atom and creates a C=C double bond.\n*   **Mechanism:** Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) are required. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- group of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=N carbon). The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating N₂ gas and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride provides a proton source (H⁺) to quench the vinyllithium, forming the final alkene product.\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone group is replaced by a C=C double bond in the ring. The other groups remain unchanged.\n    *   **Structure 3:** The exact position of the double bond depends on which α-proton is removed, but in any case, Product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This powerful reduction method affects multiple functional groups in Product 3.\n*   **Mechanism & Transformations:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both the C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the C=C double bond of the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single C-C bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis (Debenzylation):** The palladium catalyst also facilitates the cleavage of the C-O bond in the benzyl ether. This is a common deprotection strategy. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The other product of this cleavage is toluene.\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** Combining these transformations, we get a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These substituents maintain their 1,3-relationship on the ring.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the alcohol functional group has priority. The molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The substituent attached to the methanol carbon is a cyclohexyl ring that has an isopropyl group on it. Numbering the cyclohexane ring from the point of attachment (C1) to the hydroxymethyl group, the isopropyl group is located at C3. Thus, the name of the substituent is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl).\n    *   **Structure 4 Name:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\nA) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Fails to account for the Shapiro reaction correctly and the debenzylation.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This matches our derived structure and name.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. Ignores the Shapiro reaction in Step 3.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This structure results if the benzyl ether is not cleaved in the final step. Hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a standard and effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers, so it is expected to occur.\n\nTherefore, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
