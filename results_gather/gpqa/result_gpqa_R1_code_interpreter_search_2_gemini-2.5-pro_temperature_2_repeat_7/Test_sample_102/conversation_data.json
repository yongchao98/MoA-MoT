    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1,3,5. This means the bromo and nitro groups are both *meta* to the acetyl group.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nWe need to consider the order in which we add these groups. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines where the next group will attach.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and a **meta-director**. Introduced by Friedel-Crafts acylation (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃).\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Electron-withdrawing (inductive effect) but resonance-donating, deactivating overall, and an **ortho, para-director**. Introduced by bromination (e.g., Br₂/FeBr₃).\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly electron-withdrawing, strongly deactivating, and a **meta-director**. Introduced by nitration (e.g., HNO₃/H₂SO₄).\n\nA crucial rule in aromatic synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**, such as those containing a nitro group (-NO₂). This severely constrains the possible reaction sequences. The acetyl group cannot be added to a ring that already contains a nitro group.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Bromobenzene:** This works. The bromo group is an o,p-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** Nitration occurs mainly at the para position.\n3.  **1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene → Acylation:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is deactivated by both a bromo group and a nitro group. The reaction will not proceed with a good yield. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation. This works. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3). This is correct.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now we nitrate. The ring has two substituents: -COCH₃ at C1 (meta-director) and -Br at C3 (o,p-director).\n    *   The acetyl group at C1 directs the new group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group at C3 directs new groups to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   In this competitive scenario, the nitration is known to proceed at position 5, which is meta to both the acetyl and bromo groups, but is directed there by the stronger meta-director (acetyl group). The reaction gives the desired 1,3,5-substituted product in good yield.\n\nThe first three steps of this sequence successfully produce the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv to vii) seem unnecessary and would modify the product, likely representing an error in the question's construction. However, since the initial steps form a valid and high-yield synthesis, this option is the most plausible.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂ ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline** (reduction)\n3.  **Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt** (diazotization)\n4.  **Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene** (reductive deamination)\nThis four-step sequence is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n3.  **Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃:** This reaction is problematic. The basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline would react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing the desired Friedel-Crafts acylation. The intended reaction is likely N-acylation to form acetanilide, but even so, the subsequent steps would not lead to the correct product. The acetanilide group (-NHCOCH₃) is an o,p-director, leading to a different substitution pattern. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option B presents a chemically viable pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The sequence of adding the acetyl group first, then the bromine (meta to acetyl), and finally the nitro group (meta to acetyl), is the correct strategy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
