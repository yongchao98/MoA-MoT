    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch in a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This information explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl functional group, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n        *   Total mass of COOH = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n\n**Synthesize the Findings:**\n\n*   From the FTIR and Mass Spectrometry data, we can confidently conclude that the unknown compound contains a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH). This means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C) C6H12O and D) C6H10O, which only contain one oxygen atom.\n*   From the FTIR and 1H NMR data, we know the compound also contains an **alkene** functional group (C=C).\n\n**Determine the Correct Formula using Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DBE = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules with C, H, and O).\n\nFrom our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DBE\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 DBE\n*   Total required DBE = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for the remaining two options:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n    This DBE of 2 perfectly matches the required unsaturation for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n    This DBE of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not account for the C=C bond that we know is present from the FTIR and NMR data. A molecule with this formula would be a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only molecular formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence (a 6-carbon carboxylic acid containing an alkene group) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
