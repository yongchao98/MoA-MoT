    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of total relativistic energy. For a particle of mass $m$ moving in a conservative potential $U(x)$, the total energy $E_{total}$ is constant. This total energy is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy, its rest energy, and its potential energy.\n\n    The total energy can be expressed as:\n    $E_{total} = K + U(x) + mc^2$\n\n    where:\n    *   $K$ is the relativistic kinetic energy, $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n    *   $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    Substituting the expression for $K$, the total conserved energy is:\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + U(x) + mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n\n2.  **Define the Potential Energy**\n    The problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ associated with this force is:\n    $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n3.  **Identify Key Points in the Oscillation**\n    We will apply the conservation of energy between two specific points in the motion:\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude.** The mass is at its maximum displacement, $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position.** The mass is passing through its equilibrium position, $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Energy at Point 1 (Maximum Amplitude)**\n    *   Position: $x_1 = A$\n    *   Velocity: $v_1 = 0$\n    *   Since $v_1=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U(x_1) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 mc^2 + U(x_1) = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Energy at Point 2 (Equilibrium Position)**\n    *   Position: $x_2 = 0$\n    *   Velocity: $v_2 = v_{max}$\n    *   The Lorentz factor at maximum speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U(x_2) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(x_2) = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for v_max**\n    Since energy is conserved, $E_1 = E_2$:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n    *   Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    *   To isolate $v_{max}$, we first square both sides of the equation:\n        $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for the term containing $v_{max}$:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    *   Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**\n    The derived expression matches option C.\n\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n<<<C>>>"
