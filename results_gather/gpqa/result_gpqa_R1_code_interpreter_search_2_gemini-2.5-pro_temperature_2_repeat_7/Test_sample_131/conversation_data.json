    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify a pair of compounds from the given options that, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Individual Compounds**\n\nFirst, let's confirm that all proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14. (This applies to 1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4- isomers).\n*   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14.\nAll compounds fit the molecular formula.\n\nNext, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each compound based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. Two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They give **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are equivalent. They give **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Lower. One plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They give **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   Me at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   Me at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   Me at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 4 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They give **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   Me at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   Me at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. Two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They give **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups produce:\n        *   A **quartet** (from the -CH2-) with an integration of **4H**.\n        *   A **triplet** (from the -CH3) with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 singlet, 1 quartet, 1 triplet.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture's Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option by combining the spectra of the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Aromatic Region Analysis (Two singlets, 1:1 ratio)**\n\n*   The fact that there are two aromatic singlets means the mixture contains two different compounds, each contributing one singlet.\n*   The 1:1 integration ratio for these signals means that the number of aromatic protons in each compound must be the same (since it's a 1:1 molar mixture).\n*   The three tetramethylbenzene isomers each have **2** aromatic protons.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene has **4** aromatic protons.\n*   Therefore, any mixture containing 1,4-diethylbenzene with a tetramethylbenzene isomer is incorrect because the aromatic proton ratio would be 4:2 (or 2:1), not 1:1. This immediately **eliminates option D**.\n\n**Alkyl Region Analysis (Three singlets, 2:1:1 ratio)**\n\nWe only need to consider options A, B, and C. We are looking for a combination that yields exactly three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. Total alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture = 12H (from first compound) + 12H (from second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H means the signals integrate to:\n*   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n*   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n*   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\nSo we are looking for a pair of compounds that produces three singlets with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: up to five singlets (two 6H, one 6H, two 3H). This doesn't match three signals unless there is specific, significant overlap, which is not the simplest explanation. This combination cannot produce a 12H singlet. Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: A total of 1 + 3 = 4 singlets. This contradicts the data of \"three signals\". Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n    *   **1,2,4,5-TMB gives:** one 12H singlet.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-TMB gives:** two 6H singlets.\n    *   **Combined signals:** This gives exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   **Ratio:** 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n    *   Let's re-check the aromatic region for this pair: 1,2,4,5-TMB has 2 Ar-H (1 singlet) and 1,2,3,4-TMB has 2 Ar-H (1 singlet). A 1:1 mixture gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This also matches.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only combination that satisfies all the conditions described by the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
