    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    1.  Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n        DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    2.  A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    1.  **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands are a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    2.  **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl region (C=O). The frequency of 1720 cm-1 is typical for a C=O stretch of an ester group that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. It's too high for a typical amide and too low for an aryl ester (Ar-O-C=O). This points towards a structure like Ar-CO-O-Alkyl.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    1.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n        *   Integration (3H): Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   Splitting (t, triplet): The signal is split into three peaks, which by the n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons, likely a methylene (-CH2) group.\n        *   This signal is characteristic of the -CH3 part of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    2.  **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n        *   Integration (2H): Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene (-CH2) group.\n        *   Splitting (q, quartet): The signal is split into four peaks, indicating it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons, confirming it is next to the methyl group identified above.\n        *   Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm): This is a significantly deshielded chemical shift for a CH2 group. A CH2 group directly attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-COO-CH2-) typically appears in the range of 4.1-4.6 ppm.\n        *   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen: an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n\n    3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n        *   Integration (2H): Corresponds to two protons.\n        *   Splitting (bs, broad singlet): Broad signals often indicate protons that are exchangeable (e.g., with D2O) or are subject to quadrupolar broadening. This signal is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and coupling to the nitrogen atom. This confirms the presence of the -NH2 group identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n    4.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n        *   Integration (2H + 2H = 4H): There are four protons in total.\n        *   Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm): This is the aromatic region.\n        *   Splitting Pattern (two doublets): A pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n        *   Relative Chemical Shifts: One set of protons is at a relatively low chemical shift (7.0 ppm) and the other at a high chemical shift (8.0 ppm). This indicates that one substituent on the ring is an electron-donating group (EDG) and the other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n            *   The primary amine (-NH2) is a strong EDG, which shields the ortho and para protons, shifting their signals upfield (to lower ppm values).\n            *   The ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group is an EWG, which deshields the ortho and para protons, shifting their signals downfield (to higher ppm values).\n            *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOCH2CH3 group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n    The spectral data indicates the following fragments: a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). Assembling these gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an aryl ester. The NMR would show a -CH2- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide, not an ester (wrong IR C=O). It is also meta-substituted (wrong NMR aromatic pattern).\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ester, ethyl group NMR signals, and para-disubstituted aromatic NMR pattern with appropriate chemical shifts.\n    *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (wrong IR N-H), and it should show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR around 8.2 ppm, which is absent.\n\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
