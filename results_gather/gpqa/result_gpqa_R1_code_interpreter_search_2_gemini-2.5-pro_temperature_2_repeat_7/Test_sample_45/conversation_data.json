    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   The reactant is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -CH₃, -CH₂CH₃, and -CH=CH₂).\n    *   The problem states we start with a \"racemic\" mixture, which means we have a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's call them R-alkene and S-alkene for short.\n    *   The reaction uses a Grubbs catalyst, which indicates an olefin metathesis reaction. Since only one alkene is mentioned, it is a self-metathesis reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Main Product Structure:**\n    *   The self-metathesis of a terminal alkene of the form CH₂=CHR' follows this general equation:\n        2 CH₂=CHR'  ⇌  CH₂=CH₂ (ethene) + R'CH=CHR'\n    *   The question asks to exclude ethene. We need to analyze the other product, R'CH=CHR'.\n    *   In our case, R' is the sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The product is R'CH=CHR', which is (CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃))CH=CH(CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    *   The product molecule, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has three potential sources of stereoisomerism:\n        a) The chiral center at C3.\n        b) The chiral center at C6.\n        c) The C4=C5 double bond, which can be E (trans) or Z (cis).\n    *   Since the reaction starts with a racemic mixture of R-alkene and S-alkene, three types of coupling reactions can occur:\n        i)   R-alkene + R-alkene (homocoupling)\n        ii)  S-alkene + S-alkene (homocoupling)\n        iii) R-alkene + S-alkene (cross-coupling)\n\n4.  **Enumerate All Possible Stereoisomers:**\n    *   The total number of possible stereoisomers for 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene is 2ⁿ where n is the number of stereogenic elements, but we must account for meso compounds. The stereogenic elements are C3, C6, and the C4=C5 double bond.\n    *   Let's analyze the products from each coupling type:\n        *   **Homocoupling (R+R and S+S):**\n            *   R-alkene + R-alkene produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This can exist as two diastereomers: (E)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3R,6R).\n            *   S-alkene + S-alkene produces (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This also exists as two diastereomers: (E)-(3S,6S) and (Z)-(3S,6S). These are the enantiomers of the (R,R) products.\n            *   So far, this gives 4 distinct chiral stereoisomers.\n        *   **Cross-coupling (R+S):**\n            *   R-alkene + S-alkene produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n            *   This molecule has diastereomers based on the double bond geometry:\n                *   (Z)-(3R,6S) isomer: This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. This counts as 1 product.\n                *   (E)-(3R,6S) isomer: This molecule is chiral. Since it's formed in an achiral environment (racemic starting material, achiral catalyst), it will be produced as a racemic mixture, meaning both the (E)-(3R,6S) form and its enantiomer, (E)-(3S,6R), will be formed. This counts as 2 products.\n    *   **Total Stereoisomers Formed:** The total number of unique stereoisomers formed is the sum from all pathways: 4 (from homocoupling) + 1 (meso from cross-coupling) + 2 (enantiomeric pair from cross-coupling) = 7.\n\n5.  **Reconcile with the Multiple Choice Options:**\n    *   The calculated number of possible stereoisomeric products is 7. However, 7 is not among the options (A) 6, (B) 2, (C) 8, (D) 4.\n    *   This implies that either a simplifying assumption is expected, or the question is counting \"products\" in a specific way. Let's explore the most likely possibilities that lead to one of the given answers.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Counting Chiral Products Only.**\n        Out of the 7 stereoisomers formed, one is the achiral meso compound. The other 6 are chiral (three pairs of enantiomers). If the question implicitly asks for the number of *chiral* products, the answer would be 6. This matches option A.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: Counting Separable Fractions.**\n        In a laboratory setting, enantiomers are difficult to separate, but diastereomers are separable. The 7 stereoisomers would group into 4 chromatographically separable fractions:\n        1.  Racemic mixture of (E)-(3R,6R) and (E)-(3S,6S).\n        2.  Racemic mixture of (Z)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3S,6S).\n        3.  Racemic mixture of (E)-(3R,6S) and (E)-(3S,6R).\n        4.  The pure meso compound (Z)-(3R,6S).\n        Under this interpretation, there are 4 \"products\". This matches option D.\n\n    *   **Possibility 3: Assuming E-selectivity.**\n        Grubbs-catalyzed metathesis reactions, especially self-metathesis of terminal alkenes, are often highly selective for the thermodynamically more stable E (trans) isomer. If we assume only E-isomers are formed:\n        *   R+R coupling gives only (E)-(3R,6R). (1 product)\n        *   S+S coupling gives only (E)-(3S,6S). (1 product)\n        *   R+S coupling gives the racemic pair of (E)-(3R,6S) and (E)-(3S,6R). (2 products)\n        *   The total number of stereoisomers formed would be 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. This also matches option D.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Both interpretations leading to the answer 4 (counting separable fractions or assuming E-selectivity) are strong and based on common principles in organic chemistry. The E-selectivity assumption is a very common feature of this specific reaction type. The interpretation leading to 6 relies on arbitrarily excluding the meso product, which is less likely to be the intended logic. Therefore, 4 is the most probable answer.\n\nLet's stick with the most chemically direct reasoning that requires the fewest interpretation tricks: assume E-selectivity as it is a known characteristic of the reaction.\n\nFinal count assuming E-selectivity:\n1.  (E, 3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n2.  (E, 3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n3.  (E, 3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n4.  (E, 3S, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\nThese are four distinct stereoisomers that would be formed.\n\n<<<A>>>"
