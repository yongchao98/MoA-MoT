    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons in p orbitals, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers.\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system. This is one of the possible values when coupling $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, since the possible values for $l$ range from $|l_1 - l_2|$ to $l_1 + l_2$, i.e., from $|1-1|=0$ to $1+1=2$. So $l$ can be 0, 1, or 2.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum, $L_z$. The operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, and its eigenvalue for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   $L_{1z}$ is the operator for the z-component of the angular momentum of electron 1. Its eigenvalues are $m_{l1}\\hbar$, where $m_{l1}$ can be -1, 0, or 1 (since $l_1=1$).\n    *   $L_{2z}$ is the operator for the z-component of the angular momentum of electron 2. Its eigenvalues are $m_{l2}\\hbar$, where $m_{l2}$ can be -1, 0, or 1 (since $l_2=1$).\n\n3.  **Identify the Target Final State:** We want to find the probability of a specific measurement outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the measurement projects the system onto a state where $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the measurement projects the system onto a state where $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   The target final state in the uncoupled basis is therefore $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Angular Momentum's Z-Component:**\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. When we apply $L_z$ to this state, we get the eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n        $L_z |1, 1, 2, -1> = m\\hbar |1, 1, 2, -1> = -1\\hbar |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n    *   When we perform a measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ and obtain the results $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$, we have effectively measured the total z-component of angular momentum to be $(m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar$.\n    *   For the system that was initially in the eigenstate with $m=-1$, any measurement of the total z-component *must* yield $-1\\hbar$. This implies that any possible outcome of the joint measurement $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ must satisfy the condition:\n        $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$\n\n5.  **Check the Condition for the Desired Outcome:**\n    *   The initial state has $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum for this outcome: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare this sum to the initial $m$: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is a physically impossible result for a measurement on the given initial state.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    The probability of finding the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is the square of the amplitude of this state in the expansion of the initial state. This amplitude is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    Probability $P = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>|^2$\n    $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n    A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$. Since $-1 \\neq -1 + (-1)$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:** The probability of measuring $L_{1z}=-\\hbar$ and $L_{2z}=-\\hbar$ simultaneously is zero, because this outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum. The sum of the measured z-components must equal the total z-component of the initial state.\n\n<<<C>>>"
