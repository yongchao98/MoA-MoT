    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Operators**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon. These are proportional to the Pauli matrices, which are standard in quantum mechanics for representing spin-1/2 systems. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\n*   **X-component:**\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   **Y-component:**\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   **Z-component:**\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector of the operator along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in 3D spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nSince the vector lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This implies $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. We can achieve this by setting the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. This makes the unit vector:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos(0), \\sin\\theta \\sin(0), \\cos\\theta) = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\nHere, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n**3. Construct the Operator Along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator corresponding to the spin measurement along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\n\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and $\\vec{P}$:\n$P_n = (\\sin\\theta)P_x + (0)P_y + (\\cos\\theta)P_z$\n$P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n\nCombine the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nLet the eigenvector be a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides of the equation:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Solve the System of Linear Equations**\n\nThis matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, let's find a relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis gives us the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**6. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nA quantum state vector must be normalized, meaning its norm (or length) must be 1. The square of the norm is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 \\left( 1^2 + (\\tan(\\theta/2))^2 \\right) = |a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2))$\n\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = \\frac{|a|^2}{\\cos^2(\\theta/2)}$\n\nFor normalization, we set this to 1:\n$\\frac{|a|^2}{\\cos^2(\\theta/2)} = 1 \\implies |a|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) \\implies |a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$\n\nWe can choose the simplest phase for $a$, which is to make it a positive real number. So, let $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (this is valid for $-\\pi < \\theta < \\pi$).\n\nNow we find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect. An eigenvector (state vector) is dimensionless and cannot contain units of $\\hbar$.\nB) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$.\nC) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect. It has units of $\\hbar$ and no dependence on $\\theta$.\nD) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Correct. This matches our derived result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
