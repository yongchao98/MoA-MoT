    "This question requires us to compare the densities of four different exoplanets. Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\nThis is our reference point. Earth has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E.\n*   Density = ρ_E ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\nThe density is given directly in this option.\n*   Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n**c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\nWhen a planet is more massive, its self-gravity is stronger. This increased gravity compresses the material of the planet more tightly. Even if the planet is made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth (same composition), this compression will reduce its volume relative to its mass, thus increasing its overall density. A 5 Earth-mass planet (a Super-Earth) will be significantly denser than Earth due to this gravitational compression.\n*   Density > ρ_E.\n\n**d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\nConversely, a planet with less mass has weaker self-gravity. The material will be less compressed compared to Earth. Therefore, a planet with the same composition but half the mass will be less dense than Earth.\n*   Density < ρ_E.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Planet a: Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet b: Density ≈ 5.50 g/cm³.\n*   Planet c: Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to greater gravitational compression).\n*   Planet d: Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lesser gravitational compression).\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that planet c, the 5 Earth-mass planet, will be the densest of the four options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
