    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single proton (the alpha-proton).\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is 1H. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This indicates the presence of two different chemical environments for that specific alpha-proton. Since it's the *same* proton in the molecule's structure, this means the molecule itself must exist in two different forms that are stable and distinct on the NMR timescale. A 1:1 ratio of these two forms is suggested by the \"roughly equal integrals\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two separate peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities and both give the exact same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the expected mass of the target peptide. The analysis was run at an \"elevated temperature.\"\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   The two peaks in the LC confirm the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity, which determines LC retention time).\n        *   The identical mass spectra confirm that these two species are isomers of each other (same chemical formula, same mass), not a precursor or impurity with a different formula.\n        *   The \"elevated temperature\" is a key clue. It's often used to try and overcome energy barriers between conformers. The fact that two peaks are *still* observed suggests that either the two species are stable, non-interconverting isomers (like constitutional isomers or most diastereomers) or they are conformers (rotamers) with a very high energy barrier to interconversion, even at elevated temperatures.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" typically refers to spin-spin coupling, which the problem explicitly states has been ruled out as the cause. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the final product, ruling out contamination by a precursor. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and spectroscopic properties.\n        *   **NMR:** They would produce identical NMR spectra. You would only see one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, they would not separate and would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Since the observations show two peaks in both NMR and LC, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical properties and different spectroscopic properties (in all environments, achiral or chiral).\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, an alpha-proton in one diastereomer is in a different chemical environment than the same proton in the other diastereomer. This would lead to two separate peaks in the NMR spectrum. This perfectly matches the observation.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., shape, polarity), they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This would lead to two separate peaks in the LC trace. This also perfectly matches the observation.\n        *   **MS:** As isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. This matches the observation that both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Origin:** In a peptide, diastereomers can arise in two common ways: 1) Epimerization at a chiral alpha-carbon during synthesis, creating, for example, a mix of L-L and D-L dipeptides. 2) Restricted rotation around the C-N amide bond, leading to *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are a type of diastereomer (specifically, atropisomers/rotamers) and often interconvert slowly enough to be observed as separate species by NMR and sometimes even LC. This phenomenon is a classic explanation for peak doubling in peptide NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the data provided (two NMR signals, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass spectra for both).\n\n<<<C>>>"
