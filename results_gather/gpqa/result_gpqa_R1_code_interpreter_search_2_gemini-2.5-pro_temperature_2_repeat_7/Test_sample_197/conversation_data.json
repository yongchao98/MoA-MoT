    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the System**\n\nWe have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`). These ions react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`.\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\nWe are given:\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M`\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN-]` (initial) `= 0.1 M`\n*   Overall stability constants (β):\n    *   `β1` for `[Co(SCN)]+` = 9\n    *   `β2` for `[Co(SCN)2]` = 40\n    *   `β3` for `[Co(SCN)3]-` = 63\n    *   `β4` for `[Co(SCN)4]2-` = 16\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total cobalt concentration. This is also known as the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex, denoted as `α2`.\n\n`Percentage of [Co(SCN)2] = ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100% = α2 * 100%`\n\n### **2. Use Stability Constants to Relate Species Concentrations**\n\nThe overall stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n\n*   `β1 = [Co(SCN)+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-])`   =>   `[Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2)`   =>   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `β3 = [Co(SCN)3]- / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3)` =>   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `β4 = [Co(SCN)4]2- / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4)` =>   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n### **3. Formulate the Expression for the Mole Fraction (α2)**\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the equation for the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n\nFactor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nThe mole fraction `α2` is `[Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`. Let's write this expression:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels from the numerator and the denominator, leaving:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n### **4. Handle the Free Ligand Concentration [SCN-]**\n\nThe expression for `α2` depends on the concentration of the *free* thiocyanate ligand, `[SCN-]`, not the total concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of `SCN-` consumed to form the complexes will be relatively small. Therefore, it is a standard and reasonable approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total ligand concentration.\nAssumption: `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Value**\n\nNow, we can plug the numerical values into the expression for `α2`. It's easiest to calculate the denominator first. Let `D` be the denominator.\n\n*   `1`\n*   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n`D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator, `N`, is the term for the `[Co(SCN)2]` species:\n`N = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate `α2`:\n`α2 = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a small Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration (approximated as total concentration)\nL = 0.1\n\n# Denominator of the alpha fraction formula\n# It is the sum of terms for all species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, [Co(SCN)4]2-\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*L + beta2*L**2 + beta3*L**3 + beta4*L**4\n\n# Numerator of the alpha fraction for the [Co(SCN)2] species\nnumerator = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9%\n>>>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to determine the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex in a solution with known total cobalt concentration and thiocyanate concentration.\n\n**1. Understand the equilibrium system:**\n\nIn the solution, a series of equilibria exist between the free cobalt ion (`Co^2+`) and the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN-`) to form various complexes:\n\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\nThe total concentration of all species containing cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n**2. Define the mole fraction (α):**\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of this complex, denoted as `α₂`, and multiplying by 100.\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n**3. Use the stability constants (β):**\n\nThe overall stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n\n*   `[Co(SCN)+] = β₁ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β₃ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β₄ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]⁴`\n\n**4. Formulate the expression for the mole fraction (α₂):**\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β₁[Co^2+][SCN-] + β₂[Co^2+][SCN-]² + β₃[Co^2+][SCN-]³ + β₄[Co^2+][SCN-]⁴`\n\nBy factoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]²) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN-]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴)`\n\n**5. Determine the free ligand concentration:**\n\nThe given `[SCN-]` concentration is 0.1 M, while the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. Since the ligand is in a 10-fold excess compared to the metal ion, the amount of `SCN-` consumed to form the complexes is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration, `[SCN-]`, to be equal to the total initial concentration.\n`[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**6. Calculate the value:**\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   `β₁=9`\n*   `β₂=40`\n*   `β₃=63`\n*   `β₄=16`\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1`\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN-]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN-]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe denominator is `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`.\nThe numerator is the term for `[Co(SCN)2]`, which is `β₂[SCN-]² = 0.4`.\n\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**7. Convert to percentage:**\n\n`Percentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
