    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step photon emission process (a cascade decay) where a hydrogen atom transitions from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0> through an intermediate state. This process involves two electric dipole transitions.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Change in the principal quantum number `n`: `Δn` can be any integer, but for emission, `n_final < n_initial`.\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l`: `Δl = ±1`. This means the parity of the state, given by `(-1)^l`, must change.\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number `m`: `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n\n**2. Identify the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the initial state be `|i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩`, the intermediate state be `|k⟩ = |n',l',m'⟩`, and the final state be `|f⟩ = |1,0,0⟩`.\n\n*   **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n    *   Initial state has `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n    *   Applying selection rules for `l`: `l' - l = ±1` => `l' - 0 = ±1` => `l' = 1`. The intermediate state must be a *p*-state.\n    *   Applying selection rules for `m`: `m' - m = 0, ±1` => `m' - 0 = 0, ±1` => `m' = 0, +1, or -1`.\n    *   For an emission process, the energy must decrease, so `n' < 3`.\n\n*   **Second Transition: |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   Final state has `n=1, l=0, m=0`.\n    *   Applying selection rules for `l`: `l_final - l' = ±1` => `0 - l' = ±1` => `l' = 1`. This confirms that the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n    *   Applying selection rules for `m`: `m_final - m' = 0, ±1` => `0 - m' = 0, ±1` => `m' = 0, +1, or -1`. This is consistent with what we found from the first transition.\n\n*   Combining the energy and selection rule constraints, the intermediate state must be of the form `|n', 1, m'>` where `n'<3`. The problem describes a cascade ending at `n=1`, so the only possible intermediate principal quantum number is `n'=2`.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,0>`, `|2,1,1>`, and `|2,1,-1>`.\n\nThis means the possible decay routes are:\n1.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n2.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n3.  `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`\n\nAll routes listed in the options are valid in principle. The next step is to determine their probabilities.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n`P(route) = P(|i⟩ → |k⟩) * P(|k⟩ → |f⟩)`\n\n*   **Probability of the first step: P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>)**\n    *   The initial state `|3,0,0>` is a `3s` state. S-states (`l=0`) are spherically symmetric.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, `Γ ∝ |⟨k| **d** |i⟩|²`.\n    *   Because the initial `3s` state is spherically symmetric, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means the atom has an equal probability of transitioning to any of the three degenerate `m'` sub-levels of the `2p` state.\n    *   The `3s` state can only decay via single-photon emission to the `2p` state (since `Δl=±1` and `n` must decrease; the `1p` state does not exist). Therefore, the sum of probabilities for decaying into the three `2p` states must be 1.\n    *   Let `P(m')` be the probability of transitioning to the state `|2,1,m'>`. Due to symmetry:\n        `P(m'=1) = P(m'=0) = P(m'=-1)`\n    *   Since `P(m'=1) + P(m'=0) + P(m'=-1) = 1`, we have:\n        `3 * P(m') = 1` => `P(m') = 1/3`\n    *   So, the probability of the first step being `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩` is `1/3`. Similarly, the probabilities for transitions to `|2,1,1⟩` and `|2,1,-1⟩` are also `1/3`.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step: P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>)**\n    *   The atom is now in an intermediate `2p` state (`|2,1,m'>`).\n    *   The only allowed single-photon dipole transition to a lower energy level is to the `1s` state (`|1,0,0⟩`). The transition to the `2s` state (`|2,0,0>`) is highly suppressed because the energy difference is minuscule (the non-relativistic theory even has them as degenerate), and the transition rate scales as `(ΔE)³`.\n    *   Therefore, a `2p` state will decay to the `1s` state with a probability that is virtually 1.\n    *   `P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) ≈ 1` for any `m'`.\n\n**4. Calculate Total Probability and Choose the Correct Option**\n\nNow, we can find the probability for the specific route mentioned in option A: `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`.\n\n*   `P(route A) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) * P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)`\n*   `P(route A) = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3`\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and the probability is `1/3`. This matches our calculation.\nB) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and the probability is `1/4`. The route is valid, but the calculated probability is `1/3`, not `1/4`.\nC) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and the probability is `1/4`. The route is valid, but the calculated probability is `1/3`, not `1/4`.\nD) `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` and the probability is `2/3`. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThus, option A is the only one that presents a valid route with the correct probability.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation in LaTeX:\nThe allowed two-step dipole transition from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ must pass through an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ with $n'=2$ and $l'=1$. The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability for the first step, the transition from the spherically symmetric $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, is equally distributed among the three possible final $m'$ states due to rotational symmetry. Since this is the only decay channel for the $3s$ state, the total probability sums to 1. Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any specific state, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n$$ P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nFor the second step, the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ decays to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the dominant and essentially only decay channel for the $2p$ state. Thus, the probability of this transition is:\n$$ P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) \\approx 1 $$\nThe total probability for the cascade route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps:\n$$ P(\\text{route}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n<<<A>>>"
