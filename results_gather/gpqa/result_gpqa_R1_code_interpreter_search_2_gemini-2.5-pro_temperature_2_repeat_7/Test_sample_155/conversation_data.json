    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond. `CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3`.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction involves two steps:\n    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) for epoxidation.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+) for epoxide ring opening.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This two-step sequence results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a trans-(E)-alkene produces a meso compound. A useful mnemonic is \"E + anti -> meso\".\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, meso-octane-4,5-diol. This molecule has two stereocenters ((4R,5S) configuration) but is achiral due to internal symmetry (it possesses a center of inversion in its most stable conformation).\n\nLet's break it down to be sure:\n*   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** The syn-addition of an oxygen atom to a trans-(E)-alkene gives a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2 (Ring Opening):** The acid-catalyzed ring opening is an *anti*-attack by a water molecule.\n    *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the meso-diol ((4R,5S)-diol). The attack can happen at either C4 or C5, but since the molecule is chiral with equivalent carbons (related by a C2 axis), both attacks lead to the same meso product.\n    *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in the same meso-diol ((4R,5S)-diol).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The final product is exclusively **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is a single, achiral compound.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H3O+).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a cis-(Z)-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers. A useful mnemonic is \"Z + anti -> racemic\".\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nLet's break it down:\n*   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** The syn-addition of an oxygen atom to a cis-(Z)-alkene gives a meso-epoxide. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this produces the achiral cis-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R,5S) configuration).\n*   **Step 2 (Ring Opening):** The acid-catalyzed ring opening of this meso-epoxide. The two carbons of the epoxide (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic. Backside attack by water is equally likely at both carbons.\n    *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) produces one enantiomer of the diol, (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) produces the other enantiomer, (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Since attack is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The final product is a **racemic mixture** containing equal amounts of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are therefore separable.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Thus, the meso-diol will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will elute together.\n    *   **Observation:** 1 peak for the meso-diol + 1 peak for the racemic pair = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column can separate both **diastereomers** and **enantiomers**.\n    *   The meso-diol (achiral) will elute as a single peak.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will have a different retention time from them as well.\n    *   **Observation:** 1 peak for the meso-diol + 1 peak for (4R,5R)-diol + 1 peak for (4S,5S)-diol = **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
