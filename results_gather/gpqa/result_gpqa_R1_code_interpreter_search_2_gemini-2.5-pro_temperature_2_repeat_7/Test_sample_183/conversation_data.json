    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down its structure and substituent pattern:\n*   **Benzene ring**: The core structure.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    1.  **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1. This is a strong activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2. This is a weak activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. Its bulkiness significantly influences reaction regioselectivity.\n    3.  **Nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3. This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: The groups are in a 1,2,3-arrangement. This is a sterically crowded pattern that is often difficult to synthesize via simple electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and usually requires a more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups or substituent transformations.\n\nLet's draw the structure based on IUPAC nomenclature (ethoxy has priority for numbering):\n```\n      OEt (1)\n     /   \\\n t-Bu(2)---NO2(3)\n   |       |\n C(6)----C(4)\n   \\     /\n     C(5)\n```\nThe relative positions are: OEt/tBu (ortho), tBu/NO2 (ortho), OEt/NO2 (meta).\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe will now analyze each option to see if the sequence of reactions is chemically logical and could lead to the desired product.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> tert-butylbenzene\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4` -> Nitration. Major product is `p-tert-butylnitrobenzene`.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4` -> Sulfonation of `p-tert-butylnitrobenzene`. Product is `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl` -> This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate here is a nitro-sulfonic acid. This reaction will not work.\n*Conclusion: Option A is chemically incorrect.*\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4` -> Nitrobenzene\nii) `Fe/HCl` -> Aniline\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to fail or give very poor results. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group, forming a strongly deactivating `-NH3+` substituent. This deactivates the ring towards further electrophilic substitution.\n*Conclusion: Option B describes a reaction that is not a high-yield synthesis method and is generally avoided.*\n\n**Option C:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> tert-butylbenzene\nii) `SO3/H2SO4` -> `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4` -> `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\niv) `Fe/HCl` -> `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\nv) `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4` -> Nitration of a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and reactive electrophiles. Attempting to nitrate one under strong acidic conditions is not a plausible or standard synthetic step.\n*Conclusion: Option C is chemically incorrect.*\n\n**Option D:**\nThis option appears to be the most chemically plausible sequence, let's analyze it carefully.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene -> The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but its large size heavily favors para substitution. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene). A high-yield synthesis would proceed with this major isomer.\niii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 4-tert-butylaniline -> For this reaction to work well, the amino group is typically protected as an acetanilide (-NHCOCH3) first. The acetylamino group is a strong o,p-director. The para position is blocked by the tert-butyl group, so nitration is directed to the position ortho to the amine. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (after hydrolysis of the amide).\nv) `NaNO2/HCl` on 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline -> Diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt -> Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr` on 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol -> Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. The product is **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene**.\nviii) `SO3/H2SO4` -> Sulfonation.\nix) `dilute H2SO4` -> Desulfonation.\nSteps (viii) and (ix) added at the end of this sequence are nonsensical. They sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the final product, achieving no net transformation. This indicates a likely error in the option's text.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Options A, B, and C contain chemically invalid steps.\n*   Option D (steps i-vii) describes a logical and viable multi-step synthesis.\n*   However, the product of sequence D is **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). Furthermore, the final two listed reagents in option D (viii, ix) are extraneous.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question and options A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed from a chemical standpoint, option D represents the only plausible synthetic pathway among the choices, despite the errors in the target molecule name and the superfluous final steps. In the context of selecting the best possible answer from a flawed set of choices, D is the only one whose core chemical sequence is valid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
