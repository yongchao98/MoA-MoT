    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concepts: Retarded Potentials**\n    The electromagnetic fields (and thus potentials) at a point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are not determined by the state of the sources at time $t$, but by their state at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" $t_r$. This is because electromagnetic influences propagate at the finite speed of light, $c$. The time delay is the time it takes for light to travel from the source position at $t_r$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$.\n\n2.  **Defining the Variables (as per the question)**\n    *   $q$: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time. Its position at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}_r = \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time, when the signal was emitted from the charge.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The magnitude of this vector, i.e., the distance from the emission point to the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$. So, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   The retardation condition links these quantities: The time difference $t-t_r$ must be equal to the light travel time $d/c$. So, $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$.\n\n3.  **General Formulas for Retarded Potentials**\n    For continuous charge and current distributions, $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ and $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)$, the retarded potentials are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n4.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are represented using Dirac delta functions:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n    Substituting these into the integral formulas and evaluating the integrals (a non-trivial step that involves handling the retardation within the delta function) yields the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n5.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    where the subscript $[...]_{t_r}$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets ($d$, $\\hat{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. Here, $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n\n6.  **Simplifying the Expression**\n    Let's look at the denominator term:\n    $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d\\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Now, substitute this simplified denominator back into the potential expressions:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential A:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Comparing with the Options**\n    Let's compare our derived results with the given options:\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are static potentials.\n    *   B) Incorrect. The scalar potential is the static form.\n    *   C) Incorrect. The denominator has a '+' sign ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). This would describe the \"advanced potentials,\" which are solutions to Maxwell's equations that are not physically causal (effects precede causes) and are usually discarded. The question specifies $t > t_r$, implying the standard retarded (causal) solution.\n    *   D) **Correct.** The expressions $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ and $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ exactly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The minus sign in the denominator is the correct one for retarded potentials. This term accounts for the Doppler-like effect on the potential due to the motion of the source.\n\n8.  **Final Check on the Relationship between V and A**\n    From our final expressions:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V$\n    Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we get $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This well-known relationship holds for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The expression for A in option D can be rewritten as $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$ using the expression for V in the same option and the relation $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$, which confirms their consistency.\n\n<<<D>>>"
