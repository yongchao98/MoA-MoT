    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct words to complete the statement.\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamics of Oxygen as an Oxidant\n\n1.  **Concept**: The thermodynamic strength of an oxidizing agent is quantified by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidizing agent, as it has a greater tendency to be reduced (accept electrons).\n2.  **Half-Reactions**: We need to compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   **In acidic solution**: The reduction half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n    *   **In basic solution**: The reduction half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n3.  **Comparison**: We compare the two E° values:\n    +1.23 V (acidic) > +0.40 V (basic)\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since the standard reduction potential of oxygen is lower in basic solution than in acidic solution, oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\nThis eliminates options A and D, leaving us with B and C.\n\n### Part 2: Kinetics of Oxygen Reactions\n\n1.  **Concept**: Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. A kinetically fast reaction has a low activation energy, while a kinetically slow reaction has a high activation energy.\n2.  **Oxygen's Reactivity**: The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is known to be a kinetically slow process. There are two main reasons for this:\n    *   **Strong Bond**: The O=O double bond in the dioxygen molecule is very strong (bond energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol). Breaking this bond requires a significant amount of energy, which contributes to a high activation energy for the overall reaction.\n    *   **Multi-electron Transfer**: The complete reduction of O₂ to H₂O (in acid) or OH⁻ (in base) is a four-electron process. A concerted transfer of four electrons is highly improbable. The reaction must proceed through several steps, often involving intermediates like superoxide (O₂⁻) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). These intermediate steps can be slow and contribute to a large overpotential (the extra voltage needed to make the reaction run at a reasonable rate) in electrochemical cells.\n3.  **Conclusion**: Due to its high activation energy, the reaction of oxygen is kinetically **slower** than what its strong thermodynamic potential would suggest. This sluggishness is a well-known characteristic of oxygen chemistry, particularly in electrochemistry (e.g., in fuel cells and corrosion). Therefore, the second blank should be \"slower\".\n\n### Final Combination\n\n*   From Part 1, the first blank is **weaker**.\n*   From Part 2, the second blank is **slower**.\n\nThis combination \"weaker – slower\" corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
