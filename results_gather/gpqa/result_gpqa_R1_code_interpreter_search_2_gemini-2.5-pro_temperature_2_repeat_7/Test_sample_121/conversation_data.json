    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, mechanistically related to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reagents facilitate the halogenation at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   The α-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl group (CH3). One of the hydrogen atoms on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, Br-CH2-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   The -OH of the carboxyl group is replaced by the -OCH2CH3 group from ethanol.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom (a good leaving group).\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Excess sodium hydride (NaH).\n    2.  1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction sequence for forming a cyclic compound, similar to the malonic ester synthesis.\n    *   The methylene protons (-CH2-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of the acidic protons to form a carbanion (enolate): `Na⁺ [NC-CH-COOCH2CH3]⁻`.\n    *   This carbanion is a good nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. This is the first alkylation.\n        `[NC-CH-COOCH2CH3]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH( (CH2)5Br )-COOCH2CH3`\n    *   The problem states \"excess sodium hydride\". The product of the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The excess NaH removes this second proton, forming a new carbanion.\n        `NC-CH( (CH2)5Br )-COOCH2CH3 + NaH → Na⁺ [NC-C( (CH2)5Br )-COOCH2CH3]⁻`\n    *   This newly formed carbanion now undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and closing a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentyl chain, forming a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n     \n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Chirality and Symmetry:** The molecule has no chiral centers. The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups if we consider the ring as two separate paths, but tracing the ring path C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C1 shows the two pathways from C1 into the ring are identical. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral**. Achiral molecules must possess an element of symmetry (like a plane or center of symmetry) when considered in all their possible conformations (including time-averaged). For this molecule, there is an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n2.  **Signal Analysis based on Symmetry:**\n    *   **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard NMR experiment (using an achiral solvent). They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons (10 total):** The plane of symmetry relates the atoms on one side of the ring to the other.\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent due to reflection across the plane of symmetry. However, within each group, the axial (Hax) and equatorial (Heq) protons are diastereotopic because of their different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1 and the rest of the ring. Thus, Hax at C2 is equivalent to Hax at C6, and Heq at C2 is equivalent to Heq at C6. This gives **2 distinct signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, these two CH2 groups are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic. Hax at C3 is equivalent to Hax at C5, and Heq at C3 is equivalent to Heq at C5. This gives another **2 distinct signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4:** This CH2 group lies on the plane of symmetry. The axial (Hax) and equatorial (Heq) protons on this carbon are not interchanged by the symmetry operation. They are in different chemical environments (one axial, one equatorial) and are diastereotopic. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and will produce **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Tallying the signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (OCH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total number of signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\n<<<D>>>"
