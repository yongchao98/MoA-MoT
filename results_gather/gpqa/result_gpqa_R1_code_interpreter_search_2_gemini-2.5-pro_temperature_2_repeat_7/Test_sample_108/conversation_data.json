    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the not permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\nThe term symbol is given in the format `(2S+1)L(J)`.\nFor `1S0`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial NN system is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state `P_i` depends on the orbital angular momentum `L_i` and the intrinsic parities of the two nucleons. Nucleons (protons and neutrons) have an intrinsic parity of +1.\n`P_i = P(nucleon1) * P(nucleon2) * (-1)^L_i = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\nSo, the initial state has `J_i = 0` and positive parity (`P_i = +1`).\n\n### 2. Formulate the Selection Rules for the Reaction\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\nWe are given three conditions to check: conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and a Pauli statistics rule for the final NN state.\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Parity**\nThe initial parity `P_i` must equal the final parity `P_f`.\n`P_i = +1`.\nThe final state consists of the final NN system and particle X. The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l`, where `l` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the final NN system.\n*   The parity of the final NN state is `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n*   The intrinsic parity of particle X is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n*   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l = (-1)^(L_f + l + 1)`.\nFor parity to be conserved, `P_f` must be `+1`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l + 1` to be an even number.\nTherefore, `L_f + l` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n`J_i = J_{total, f}`.\nSince `J_i = 0`, the total final angular momentum must also be zero. The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n`J_f + j_X = 0` (vector sum).\nThis implies that `J_f` and `j_X` must have equal magnitude: `|J_f| = |j_X|`.\nThe problem specifies the angular momentum of X using spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum (`s` for `l=0`, `p` for `l=1`, etc.). This typically implies that particle X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion). If spin `s_X = 0`, then `j_X = l`.\nThus, the conservation of angular momentum requires `J_f = l`.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem provides the constraint from Pauli statistics for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nWe are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\nSubstituting this into the rule:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number (or 0). This means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Summary of Rules for an Allowed Transition:**\n1.  `L_f + l` must be odd (Parity).\n2.  `J_f = l` (Angular Momentum, assuming `s_X=0`).\n3.  `S_f + L_f` must be odd (Pauli Principle for `T_f=0`).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the four proposed reactions against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l=1`.\n1.  **Parity:** `L_f + l = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1`, `l = 1`. `J_f = l`. **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\nThis reaction is **allowed**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1 = 7` -> `S_f = 3`. `L_f = 2` (D-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A total spin of `S=3` is impossible. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is not a valid physical state for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l=0`.\n1.  **Parity:** `L_f + l = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 0`, `l = 0`. `J_f = l`. **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l=3`.\n1.  **Parity:** `L_f + l = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 3`, `l = 3`. `J_f = l`. **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\nThis reaction is **allowed**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nWe have found two reactions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **C)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle selection rule `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f = 0`.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to use the conservation laws and the given Pauli statistics rule. Option C is the one that is invalidated by a direct application of these specific rules. Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason related to the composition of the states, which is assumed as pre-requisite knowledge rather than a rule of the transition itself. In the context of such problems, one is expected to find the option that fails the given selection rules. Thus, C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
