    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: Rotation by 360/3 = 120 degrees about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n2.  A **σh mirror plane**: A horizontal plane of reflection that is perpendicular to the C3 principal axis.\n3.  The point group C3h also includes an S3 improper rotation axis and an inversion center (i), although the presence of C3 and σh is sufficient to define it.\n4.  Crucially, for a molecule to be **exactly** C3h, it must *lack* other symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate, B(OCH(CH3)2)3**\n\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, forming a trigonal planar B(O)3 core. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The C3 axis would pass through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. The σh plane would have to be the plane containing the B(O)3 atoms.\n*   For the molecule to have a σh plane, every atom above the plane must have a corresponding identical atom below the plane. An isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2, does not have a plane of symmetry that can coincide with the B(O)3 plane. To satisfy the σh symmetry, if the alpha-carbon and its H atom lie in the plane, one methyl group would be above and one below. While a single group could be oriented this way, steric hindrance between the three large isopropyl groups would likely force them to twist out of the plane in a \"propeller-like\" conformation. This conformation would retain the C3 axis but would destroy the σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate is likely to have C3 (propeller) or Cs symmetry, but not C3h.\n\n**B) quinuclidine**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage structure with a nitrogen atom and a methine group (CH) at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a clear C3 axis of rotation that passes through the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the bridgehead carbon atom. However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis because one end of the axis has a nitrogen atom and the other has a CH group. Reflecting across this plane would not result in an identical molecule. The molecule does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes puts quinuclidine in the **C3v** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the common chemical mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central six-membered carbon ring to which three five-membered anhydride rings are fused. The molecule is known to be planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Being planar, it possesses a **σh** plane (the plane of the molecule).\n    *   It has a **C3** axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the central ring.\n    *   It also has three **C2 axes** lying within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of the C-C bonds that link the anhydride rings.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis, a perpendicular σh, and perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule has D3h symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group. While D3h is a higher symmetry group that contains all the symmetry operations of C3h, when asked to identify a molecule with a specific point group, one typically looks for the molecule for which that group is the highest and complete description.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a triphenylene core. Triphenylene (C18H12) is a large, planar aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry. To this core, three anhydride groups (-C(O)OC(O)-) are fused at the 1-2, 5-6, and 9-10 positions. These three positions are located on the three distinct outer benzene rings of the triphenylene structure and are related to each other by a 120° rotation.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is large and planar, so it has a **σh** mirror plane coinciding with the molecular plane.\n    *   The threefold symmetric placement of the anhydride groups preserves the **C3** axis of the original triphenylene core, which is perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   Now, we check for other symmetries. Do the perpendicular C2 axes or the σv planes of the original triphenylene still exist? No. The substitution pattern is not symmetric with respect to these operations. For instance, a C2 axis of triphenylene would map a part of the periphery with an anhydride group onto a different part of the periphery that does not have one. Similarly, a vertical mirror plane (σv) is also lost.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane but lacks the perpendicular C2 axes and σv planes that would raise its symmetry to D3h.\n*   **Conclusion:** The set of symmetry elements {E, C3, σh} defines the **C3h** point group. This molecule's point group is precisely C3h.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nComparing the four molecules:\n*   A is not C3h.\n*   B is C3v.\n*   D is D3h.\n*   C is C3h.\n\nTherefore, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
