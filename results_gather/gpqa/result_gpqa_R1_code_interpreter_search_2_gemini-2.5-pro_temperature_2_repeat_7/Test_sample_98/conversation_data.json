    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated molecules, which is consistent with this finding.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** According to the n+1 rule, this signal arises from a proton that is coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring proton groups. Specifically, it must be coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n        *   A group of three neighboring protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This signal arises from a proton that is coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring proton groups. Specifically, it must be coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n        *   Another, different group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a second triplet).\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Proposed Structure:**\n    We need to find the structure that has both a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) and another proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H). The protons being analyzed are typically CH (methine) protons, as they are often bonded to multiple, varied groups. Let's analyze the connectivity (who is bonded to whom) for each option. We number the carbons of the main chain starting from the COOH group as carbon #1.\n\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n        -   Proton on C3: Is coupled to H on C2 (1H), CH2 on C4 (2H), and CH2 of its own ethyl group (2H). Neighbor counts: (1, 2, 2). This gives a **dtt** signal. This matches one criterion.\n        -   Let's look for a dtq (1, 2, 3 neighbors). No proton in this molecule has this combination of neighbors. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n        -   Proton on C3: Is coupled to H on C2 (1H), CH2 on C4 (2H), and CH3 of its own methyl group (3H). Neighbor counts: (1, 2, 3). This gives a **dtq** signal. This matches one criterion.\n        -   Let's look for a dtt (1, 2, 2 neighbors). No proton in this molecule has this combination of neighbors. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        `CH3(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n        -   Proton on C3: Is coupled to H on C4 (1H), CH2 on C2 (2H), and CH3 of its own methyl group (3H). Neighbor counts: (1, 2, 3). This gives a **dtq** signal. This matches one criterion.\n        -   Let's look for a dtt (1, 2, 2 neighbors). No proton in this molecule has this combination of neighbors. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → Structure corresponding to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (based on IUPAC rules for longest chain)**\n        `CH3(chain_end)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n        Let's analyze the two central methine (CH) protons:\n        -   **Proton on C3**: Is coupled to the CH2 on C2 (2H), the H on C4 (1H), and the CH2 of its own ethyl group substituent (2H). The neighbor counts are (2, 1, 2). This proton will therefore produce a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) signal. This matches one of the required signals.\n        -   **Proton on C4**: Is coupled to the H on C3 (1H), the CH3 at the end of the chain (3H), and the CH2 of its own ethyl group substituent (2H). The neighbor counts are (1, 3, 2). This proton will therefore produce a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) signal. This matches the second required signal.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Only structure B has protons that would give rise to both a `doublet of triplets of triplets` and a `doublet of triplets of quartets`. Therefore, it is the correct identification of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
