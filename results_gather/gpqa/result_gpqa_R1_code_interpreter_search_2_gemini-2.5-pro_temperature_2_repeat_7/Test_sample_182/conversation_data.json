    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and its Structure:**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break down this name to draw its structure and determine its molecular formula.\n    *   **Parent chain:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n    *   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). By IUPAC convention, the carbon atom to which this group is attached is C1.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   At C2: a `formyl` group (-CHO).\n        *   At C5: a `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2).\n\n    Let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant:\n    *   The carbon skeleton has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 in the -COOH group, 1 in the -CHO group, and 2 in the -CH=CH2 group. Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n    *   The oxygen atoms are 2 in -COOH and 1 in -CHO. Total Oxygens (O) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   To find the number of hydrogens, we can saturate each carbon with H atoms based on the structure:\n        *   C1: bonded to COOH, C2, and C6. It needs one H.\n        *   C2: bonded to CHO, C1, and C3. It needs one H.\n        *   C3: part of a double bond, bonded to C2 and C4. It needs one H.\n        *   C4: part of a double bond, bonded to C3 and C5. It needs one H.\n        *   C5: bonded to vinyl, C4, and C6. It needs one H.\n        *   C6: bonded to C1 and C5. It needs two H's.\n        *   Hydrogens on the ring = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7.\n        *   Hydrogens on substituents: 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, and 3 in -CH=CH2. Total H on substituents = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.\n        *   Total Hydrogens (H) = 7 (ring) + 5 (substituents) = 12.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant (optional but good for verification):**\n    The formula for IHD is: `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1` (ignoring oxygen and halogens).\n    IHD_reactant = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n    Let's verify this with the structure:\n    *   1 ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C in the ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. The formula is correct.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reagents and the Reaction:**\n    The reagents are **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess of HI**. This combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. It performs an exhaustive reduction.\n\n4.  **Determine the Effect of the Reaction on the Reactant:**\n    Red P / HI reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C=C) will be reduced to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to a single bond, making it an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product:**\n    The reaction does not add or remove carbon atoms. Thus, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms.\n    The reaction reduces all pi bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, converting the starting molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon, while keeping the ring structure.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The substituents become alkyl groups.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. This is a type of **cycloalkane**.\n    A cycloalkane with `n` carbon atoms has the general molecular formula **CnH2n**.\n    Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (C10), its molecular formula will be **C10H20**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The IHD represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + 1\n    For the product C10H20:\n    IHD_product = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    IHD_product = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD_product = 1\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD for a saturated cycloalkane is always 1, because the ring itself accounts for one degree of unsaturation (it has two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding open-chain alkane, CnH2n+2). Since the product is a substituted cyclohexane with no other rings or multiple bonds, its IHD must be 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
