    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given compound. The standard formula to calculate the enthalpy of formation from bond energies is:\n\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of constituent elements in their standard state) - (Sum of bond energies of the compound)\n\nLet's break down the calculation into several steps.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the bonds in the molecule.**\n\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's draw the structure to determine the number of C, H atoms and the number of different types of bonds.\n\nThe structure can be described as a 7-carbon chain with several methyl group branches:\n      CH3                             CH3\n       |                               |\nH3C - C(1) = C(2)H - C(3)H2 - C(4)H - C(5)H2 - C(6)H = C(7) - CH3\n                                 |                          |\n                                 CH3                        CH3\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** There are 7 carbons in the main chain, plus 5 methyl (CH3) groups (two on C1, one on C4, two on C7). So, Total C = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   H on the chain: C2(1), C3(2), C4(1), C5(2), C6(1) -> 1+2+1+2+1 = 7 H.\n    *   H in the 5 methyl groups: 5 * 3 = 15 H.\n    *   Total H = 7 + 15 = 22.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n\nNow, let's count the bonds:\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the chain (C1=C2 and C6=C7).\n    Number of C=C bonds = 2.\n*   **C-H single bonds:** The total number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom.\n    Number of C-H bonds = 22.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure, or use a shortcut. For any acyclic molecule with 'n' carbon atoms, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms (single, double, or triple) is n-1. Here n=12, so there are 11 bonds between carbons. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds.\n    Number of C-C bonds = 11 - 2 = 9.\n    (Verification by counting: 4 in the chain [C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6] and 5 connecting the methyl groups [2 on C1, 1 on C4, 2 on C7]. 4 + 5 = 9. The count is correct).\n\n**Summary of bonds:**\n*   2 × C=C bonds\n*   9 × C-C bonds\n*   22 × C-H bonds\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the sum of bond energies for the compound (Enthalpy of Atomization of the compound).**\n\nThis is the energy required to break one mole of the compound into its constituent atoms in the gaseous state.\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (2 × BE(C=C)) + (9 × BE(C-C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (2 × 300) + (9 × 200) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atomization(compound) = 600 + 1800 + 8800\nΔH_atomization(compound) = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the sum of enthalpies of atomization of the constituent elements.**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states to gaseous atoms for the formation of one mole of the compound (12 C atoms and 22 H atoms).\nFormation reaction: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nThe energy required is for:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)  and  11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nΔH_atoms(elements) = (12 × Enthalpy of atomization of C) + (11 × Bond energy of H-H)\nUsing the given values:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of C = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atoms(elements) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atoms(elements) = 12000 + 1100\nΔH_atoms(elements) = 13100 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f).**\n\nΔH_f = ΔH_atoms(elements) - ΔH_atomization(compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is +1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 5: Check the given options.**\n\nThe options are:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur result is 1900 kJ/mol. Option D is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation. Option C has the right value but the wrong units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option A is incorrect.\n\nLet's check option B, which is given in kJ/g. We need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass of the compound C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × atomic mass of C) + (22 × atomic mass of H)\nM = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol)\nM = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n\nNow convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option B (11.44 kJ/g).\n\nI will perform the calculation using a python script for verification.\n```python\n# Given data\nE_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100      # kJ/mol\nBE_CC = 200      # kJ/mol\nBE_C_dbl_C = 300 # kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400      # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecule C12H22\n# Number of atoms\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds\nnum_C_dbl_C = 2\nnum_CC = 9\nnum_CH = 22\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the compound\ndelta_H_atom_compound = (num_C_dbl_C * BE_C_dbl_C) + (num_CC * BE_CC) + (num_CH * BE_CH)\n\n# Enthalpy to form gaseous atoms from elements\n# For 12 C atoms and 22 H atoms (from 11 H2 molecules)\ndelta_H_atoms_elements = (num_C * E_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * BE_HH)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndelta_H_f_mol = delta_H_atoms_elements - delta_H_atom_compound\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22\nmolar_mass_compound = (num_C * 12.0) + (num_H * 1.0)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass_compound\n\nprint(f\"{delta_H_f_gram=}\")\n```\n>>>\ndelta_H_f_gram=11.44578313253012\n<<<\nThe calculated value is 11.4457... kJ/g, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

So, 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of C-C bonds (single, double, triple) is n-1, where n is the number of carbon atoms. Here, n=12, so there are a total of 12 - 1 = 11 bonds between carbon atoms.

The formation reaction is: 12C(s) + 11H2(g) -> C12H22(g).\n    *   Energy for Carbon: 12 × (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 × 1000 = 12000 kJ.\n    *   Energy for Hydrogen: We need 22 H atoms, which come from 11 H2 molecules.
