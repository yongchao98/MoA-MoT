    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. In the context of a particle detector, \"resolution\" refers to the minimum distance ($L_{res}$) a particle must travel from its creation point for its decay to be spatially distinguished. Therefore, an \"observed\" decay is one where the particle travels a distance $L > L_{res}$ before decaying.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physics Condition:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will survive to travel a distance $L$ or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(l \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n\n    We are given that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the fraction of particles traveling a distance greater than the resolution $L_{res}$ must be at least 30%.\n    $P(l \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    To find the minimum required resolution, we consider the boundary condition. The resolution $L_{res}$ must be less than or equal to a maximum value. The question is asking for this value.\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30 \\implies L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx 1.204 \\lambda$\n\n    Let's check if this value matches the options. Sometimes, in physics problems, \"30%\" is used as a rounded value for $1/3$. Let's test this hypothesis.\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3 \\implies L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986 \\lambda$\n    We will proceed with calculations for both interpretations and see which one matches the given options.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length in the lab frame depends on the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), its velocity ($v$), and relativistic time dilation (described by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$).\n    The mean lifetime in the lab frame is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    The mean decay length is $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass ($m$) using the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$. In units where $c=1$, this simplifies to $E = \\gamma m$.\n    Given:\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$\n    \n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n5.  **Express Mean Decay Length in terms of $\\gamma$:** We can relate the velocity $v$ to $\\gamma$ using $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\lambda$:\n    $\\lambda = (c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}) \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now, we substitute the given values into the formulas.\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 2.9979 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\gamma = 27 / 3.41$\n\n    We can write a simple Python script to perform the calculation with high precision to avoid rounding errors. The script will calculate $\\lambda$ and then $L_{res}$ using both interpretations (0.30 and 1/3) for the percentage.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE = 27  # GeV\nm = 3.41  # GeV\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # s\nc = 299792458  # m/s\n\n# 1.

Calculate the resolution for both interpretations\n# Case 1: 30% = 0.30\npercentage_30 = 0.30\nL_res_30 = -mean_decay_length * math.log(percentage_30)\n\n# Case 2: 30% is an approximation for 1/3\npercentage_1_3 = 1/3\nL_res_1_3 = -mean_decay_length * math.log(percentage_1_3) # same as mean_decay_length * math.log(3)\n\nprint(f\"Mean decay length (lambda): {mean_decay_length:.4g} m\")\nprint(f\"Resolution for 30% (L_res_30): {L_res_30:.4g} m\")\nprint(f\"Resolution for 1/3 (L_res_1_3): {L_res_1_3:.4g} m\")\n```\n>>>\nMean decay length (lambda): 1.884e-06 m\nResolution for 30% (L_res_30): 2.268e-06 m\nResolution for 1/3 (L_res_1_3): 2.070e-06 m\n>>>\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The Python script gives two possible results for the resolution:\n    *   Using 30% (0.30): $L_{res} = 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   Using 1/3: $L_{res} = 2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    Let's compare these to the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\n    The calculated value $2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (from the 1/3 interpretation) is extremely close to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (less than 0.5%) can be attributed to minor rounding in the problem's given constants (E, m, or $\\tau_0$). The value calculated using 0.30 ($2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) does not match any option well. Therefore, it is highly probable that \"30%\" was intended to mean \"1/3\".\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. An observed decay means the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$) before decaying.\n\n### 1. The Decay Probability\n\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $l$ before decaying is given by the probability density function:\n$P(l) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}e^{-l/\\lambda}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe probability that a particle will travel a distance greater than or equal to a certain length $L_{res}$ is given by integrating this from $L_{res}$ to infinity:\n$P(l \\geq L_{res}) = \\int_{L_{res}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\lambda}e^{-l/\\lambda} dl = \\left[-e^{-l/\\lambda}\\right]_{L_{res}}^{\\infty} = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\nWe want to observe at least 30% of the decays, which means we require this probability to be at least 0.30:\n$P(l \\geq L_{res}) \\geq 0.30$\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\geq 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution, we consider the equality:\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nThe mean decay length in the laboratory frame is given by:\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\nwhere $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nDue to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass ($m$) by the equation $E = \\gamma mc^2$. In particle physics, we often use units where $c=1$, so $E = \\gamma m$.\nGiven:\n*   Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Mass of $X^0$, $m = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$\n*   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\nThe velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. We can express the mean decay length as:\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0 = (c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}) \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values:\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Resolution ($L_{res}$)\n\nNow we calculate the required resolution $L_{res}$:\n$L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis value does not perfectly match any of the options. In physics problems of this type, it's common for a percentage like \"30%\" to be a rounded value for a simpler fraction, such as $1/e$ or $1/3$. Let's test the possibility that the problem meant for $1/3$ of the particles to be observed.\n\nIf $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$:\n$L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n$L_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis value, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to option A, which is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small difference can be attributed to using a more precise value for the speed of light or minor rounding in the problem's given constants. Let's re-evaluate using the Python output which used a more precise value for c.\n\nThe python output gave: `Resolution for 1/3 (L_res_1_3): 2.07e-06 m`. This confirms our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the minimum resolution needed is approximately $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nOption A is the closest match to our calculated value.\n\n<<<A>>>"
