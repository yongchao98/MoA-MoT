    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes of its constituent elements.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The M⁺ and M⁺+2 peaks with an intensity ratio of approximately 100:32 (which is close to 3:1) are a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All the given options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molar mass for this formula is approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that corresponds to the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O stretching vibration. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both of these peaks strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde and a phenol) and B (Phenyl chloroformate, which is a chloroformate ester and has no O-H group). We are left with options C (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The fact that it is a singlet integrating to one proton confirms this assignment. This supports our conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region: a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   This simple pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n    *   Let's analyze the remaining options:\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. There is no plane of symmetry bisecting the ring protons. All four aromatic protons would be in chemically different environments and would give rise to a more complex splitting pattern, likely four separate signals (or a complex multiplet), each integrating to 1H. This does not match the data.\n        *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. It has the necessary symmetry. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent and are the most deshielded, corresponding to the doublet at 8.02 ppm. The two protons ortho to the -Cl group (positions 3 and 5) are also equivalent and are less deshielded, corresponding to the doublet at 7.72 ppm. This structure perfectly matches the ¹H NMR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nCombining all the evidence:\n*   MS indicates a compound with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR indicates it's a carboxylic acid.\n*   ¹H NMR indicates a para-substituted benzene ring structure.\n\nOnly 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
