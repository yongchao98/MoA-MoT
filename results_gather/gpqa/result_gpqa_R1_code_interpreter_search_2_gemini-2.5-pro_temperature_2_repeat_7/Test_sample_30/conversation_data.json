    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### **Step 1: Toluene treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The combination of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) generates the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a strong electrophile.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH3) on the benzene ring. The methyl group is an ortho, para-directing and activating group.\n*   **Product 1:** The nitration of toluene produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene) is the major product. We will follow the reaction path of the major product.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene):** A benzene ring with a -CH3 group and a -NO2 group at positions 1 and 4, respectively.\n\n### **Step 2: Product 1 treated with MnO2 and H2SO4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) in the presence of sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent that can oxidize the alkyl side chains of an aromatic ring to carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 is *p*-nitrotoluene. The methyl group (-CH3) is a benzylic carbon, which is susceptible to oxidation. The nitro group (-NO2) is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of *p*-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The product is *p*-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n    *   **Structure of Product 2 (*p*-nitrobenzoic acid):** A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -NO2 group at positions 1 and 4, respectively.\n\n### **Step 3: Product 2 treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This step is more complex and involves several stages.\n    *   **a) Acid-Base Reactions:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The carboxylic acid proton of *p*-nitrobenzoic acid is far more acidic than the alpha-protons of acetone. So, NaOH first deprotonates *p*-nitrobenzoic acid to form sodium *p*-nitrobenzoate. Then, excess base can deprotonate acetone ((CH3)2C=O) at its alpha-carbon to form the acetone enolate ion (-CH2C(O)CH3), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **b) Nucleophilic Attack (Janovsky Reaction):** The *p*-nitrobenzoate ring is electron-deficient due to the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro (-NO2) and carboxylate (-COO-) groups. The acetone enolate will attack the ring at a position activated for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which is a position ortho to the nitro group (i.e., position 2 or 6). This attack forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion intermediate known as a Meisenheimer complex.\n    *   **c) Rearomatization:** The Meisenheimer complex is a non-aromatic cyclohexadienyl anion. To regain the stability of the aromatic ring, it must lose a leaving group. In this case, the leaving group from the attacked carbon is a hydride ion (H-). The loss of H- is an oxidation process. This oxidation can be effected by an external oxidizing agent (like O2 from the air) or by another molecule of the nitroaromatic compound acting as the oxidant (being itself reduced).\n    *   **Product 3:** The final, stable product is the result of substituting a hydrogen atom on the ring with the acetonyl group. The substitution occurs at the position ortho to the nitro group. The final product is 2-acetonyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid (or its deprotonated form, 2-acetonyl-4-nitrobenzoate).\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** A benzene ring with substituents at C1 (-NO2), C2 (-CH2COCH3), and C4 (-COOH or -COO-).\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** 2-acetonyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to find the symmetry elements (rotation axes, mirror planes, center of inversion) for this molecule.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cn):** The molecule has an asymmetric 1,2,4-substitution pattern with three different groups. There are no rotation axes (other than the trivial C1 axis). This immediately rules out the point groups D2h, C2h, and C3.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion. This also rules out D2h and C2h.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** The only remaining possibility from the given options is **Cs**. A molecule belongs to the Cs point group if its only symmetry element, besides the identity (E), is a single mirror plane.\n    *   Let's see if the molecule can adopt a conformation that has a mirror plane. Consider the plane defined by the benzene ring. If we can arrange all three substituents to be symmetric with respect to this plane, then this plane is a mirror plane (σ).\n        *   The -NO2 group and the -COOH group are themselves planar and can lie in the plane of the ring.\n        *   For the -CH2COCH3 substituent, the C-C-O-C chain of atoms can be oriented to lie within this plane. The two hydrogen atoms of the -CH2- group would then be positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below. Similarly, one hydrogen of the terminal -CH3 group can lie in the plane, while the other two are positioned symmetrically above and below the plane.\n    *   In this specific conformation, the plane containing the aromatic ring and the backbone of the substituents acts as a single plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses one mirror plane and no other symmetry elements, its molecular symmetry group is **Cs**.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
