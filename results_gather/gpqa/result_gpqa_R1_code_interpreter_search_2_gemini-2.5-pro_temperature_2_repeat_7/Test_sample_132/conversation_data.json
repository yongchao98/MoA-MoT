    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the components of the solution:**\n*   We add KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O to water.\n*   These salts dissociate completely:\n    *   KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate)\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate) + 2H2O\n*   The solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), forming a buffer.\n\n**2. Identify the relevant equilibria:**\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n*   (1) H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4- ; Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3\n*   (2) H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8\n*   (3) HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12\n\nOur solution contains H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, so the primary equilibrium that determines the pH is the second dissociation (Ka2). The concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation (Ka3).\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\nFirst, we need to calculate the moles of each component and then their concentration in the 200.00 cm3 (0.20000 L) solution.\n\n*   **Moles of KH2PO4 (source of H2PO4-):**\n    Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Concentration of H2PO4-:**\n    [H2PO4-] = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (source of HPO4^2-):**\n    Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   **Concentration of HPO4^2-:**\n    [HPO4^2-] = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]:**\nWe use the equilibrium expression for Ka2:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+], assuming the initial concentrations are close to the equilibrium concentrations, which is a valid assumption for a buffer.\n[H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] = 8.113 x 10^-8 M\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]:**\nNow, we use the equilibrium expression for Ka3, which governs the formation of PO4^3-:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\nRearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nWe use the calculated [H+] and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since its dissociation is negligible due to the very small Ka3).\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.113 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.234 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\nLet's run a single python script to perform the calculations precisely.\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.20000  # L\n\n# Dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = (mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4) / volume\nconc_hpo4_2minus = (mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o) / volume\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# We assume the equilibrium concentration of HPO4^2- is equal to its initial concentration.\nconc_po4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus) / conc_H_plus\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.24e-07\n\nThe calculation yields a concentration of 6.24 x 10^-7 M for the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The first step is to calculate the initial molar concentrations of the two salts dissolved in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    This salt dissociates completely to provide H₂PO₄⁻ ions.\n\n2.  **Calculate moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    This salt dissociates completely to provide HPO₄²⁻ ions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻: [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻: [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\nThe solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), forming a buffer. The pH of this buffer is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nWe can use the equilibrium expression for Ka₂ to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]:\n\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻. This ion is formed in the third dissociation step:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nWe can use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃:\n\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have. We use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ as its concentration at equilibrium because its dissociation is negligible (Ka₃ is very small).\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe code has already performed this calculation accurately. The result is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
