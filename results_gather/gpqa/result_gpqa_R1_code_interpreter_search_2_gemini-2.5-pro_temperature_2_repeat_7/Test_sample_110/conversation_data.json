    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate will then attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Ketone (nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK).\n\n3.  **Analyze enolate formation:**\n    *   First, we must identify the α-carbons of the ketone, which are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O at position 1). These are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has no α-protons to be removed by the base.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the base t-BuOK **must** abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate. This is a question of regioselectivity, and here there is only one possible outcome.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Michael addition step:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C6 is the nucleophile. The C6 carbon will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The reaction creates a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (C3) of the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated during work-up to yield the final product.\n    *   The structure of the product is the original cyclohexanone ring, now with a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n5.  **Name the product (A):**\n    *   To name the product according to the format given in the options (\"ethyl 3-(...)propanoate\"), the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate main chain.\n    *   The propanoate chain is attached to the ring at its C3 position. This means the ring is attached via what was originally C6 of the ketone. For IUPAC naming of the substituent, this attachment point becomes position 1 (C1') of the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   Let's trace the numbering of the ring as a substituent:\n        *   C1' is the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). This carbon also has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' is the original C1 of the ketone, which bears the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3' is the original C2 of the ketone, which has both an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting this together, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   The name derived above matches the structure for A given in options **A** and **B**.\n    *   Options C and D suggest a different structure, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, where the ketone is at position 4. This product would require the Michael addition to occur at a carbon that is γ (gamma) to the carbonyl group, which is mechanistically impossible under these conditions. Therefore, options C and D are incorrect.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. KOH is a base that deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate). This carbanion acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane (nucleophile precursor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n3.  **Analyze carbanion formation:**\n    *   KOH abstracts one of the two protons from the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic carbanion: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Michael addition step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` part of `CH=CHCN`).\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed. Let's trace the backbone:\n        `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]` -- `[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]`\n    *   The resulting molecule is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (B):**\n    *   The functional group with the highest priority is the nitrile (-CN), so the compound is named as a substituted hexanenitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n    *   This name matches the product B described in options **A** and **C**.\n    *   The product B in options B and D is `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. This structure (`C₆H₁₀N₂O₂`) has a different molecular formula from the one expected from the addition of 1-nitropropane (`C₃H₇NO₂`) and but-2-enenitrile (`C₄H₅N`), which should be `C₇H₁₂N₂O₂`. The name `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` corresponds to the correct formula. Thus, the structure in options B and D is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The correct product for reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct product for reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two correct products leads to the selection of option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
