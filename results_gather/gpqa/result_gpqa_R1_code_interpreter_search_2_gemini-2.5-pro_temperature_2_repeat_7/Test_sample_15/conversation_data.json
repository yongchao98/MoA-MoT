    "An optically active compound must be chiral and not be a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of chiral centers and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The question provides specific stereoisomers, so we are not dealing with racemic mixtures. The task is to identify which of the given molecular structures are chiral.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (`3aR, 7aS`) and the stereochemistry of a double bond (`E`).\n    *   The parent skeleton without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group might have a plane of symmetry. However, the `(E)-chloromethylene` group (`=CHCl`) attached to the bridge (position 8) is unsymmetrical and breaks any potential plane of symmetry in the parent structure.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses chiral centers and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is chiral.\n    *   The name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer, which will be optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (`H`, `CH3`, `COOH`, and `CH(CH3)COOH`) are the same as the substituents on C3.\n    *   When the two chiral centers have the same set of substituents, the stereoisomer with opposite configurations (`R` and `S`) is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes them achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   The stereoisomer with (`R,R`) configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (`S,S`) stereoisomer, and they are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   A single enantiomer, such as the (`2R,3R`) isomer specified, is chiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (`C3=C4`) and an alcohol group (`OH` at `C1`).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=`, and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a substituted cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is not standard IUPAC nomenclature, but it is likely intended to specify the all-`cis` isomer (all OH groups on the same side of the ring), which is the most symmetrical isomer.\n    *   In the all-`cis` configuration, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral. In fact, all possible stereoisomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol can be shown to have a plane of symmetry and are therefore achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for chiral centers (a carbon with four different substituents).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is `sp2`-hybridized and not a chiral center.\n    *   None of the carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are chiral.\n    *   The `CH2` group in the chain is not chiral.\n    *   The `CH` carbon in the isopropyl group `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups (`CH3`), and the rest of the molecule. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and does not exhibit any other form of chirality (like axial or planar). It possesses a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n2.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Yes\n3.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No\n4.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes\n5.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes\n6.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No\n7.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
