    "*   **Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n    1.  **Identification of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n        *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1. For C8H9NO, DoU = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C) or a ring.\n        *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n            *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a carbon with two protons (n+1 rule), i.e., a -CH₂- group. So, we have a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n            *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the -CH₂- group identified above. The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is adjacent to a carbon with one proton, which is the aldehyde proton.\n            *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n            *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons, coupled with the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula, indicates a primary amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   **Structure Assembly:** Putting all the fragments together, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO) as the two substituents. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + CH₂(NH₂) + CH₂CHO -> C₈H(4+2+1+2)NO -> C₈H₉NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    2.  **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n        *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        *   **Reagent 1: NaNO₂, HCl:** This is the diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in-situ) at low temperatures to yield a diazonium salt. The product is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n        *   **Reagent 2: H₂O:** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (hydrolysis), often upon gentle warming. The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved. This reaction transforms the diazonium salt into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has an aldehyde group and α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), which are the prerequisites for an **aldol reaction**. Since it reacts with itself, it is a self-aldol reaction.\n            *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n                The structure of this initial addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This matches option D).\n            *   **Aldol Condensation:** The reaction is carried out with **Heat**. Heating an aldol addition product under basic (or acidic) conditions causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated. This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This final product is highly stable due to the conjugation between the newly formed C=C double bond and the C=O double bond of the aldehyde.\n            *   The structure of the condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option B.\n\n    3.  **Conclusion**\n        The question asks for the final product of the entire reaction sequence. The inclusion of \"Heat\" in the final step is a strong indicator that the reaction proceeds to the thermodynamically more stable condensation product rather than stopping at the aldol addition intermediate.\n\n*   Starting Material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   After steps 1 & 2: 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n*   After step 3 (addition): 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D)\n*   After step 3 (condensation due to heat): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option B)\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
