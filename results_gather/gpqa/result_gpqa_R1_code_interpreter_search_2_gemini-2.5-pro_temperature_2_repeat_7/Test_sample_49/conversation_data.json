    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given expression:**\n    The expression found on the note is a \"size estimate\" for a calculation in a new quantum field theory:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the expression:**\n    In quantum field theory, expressions for Feynman diagram amplitudes are typically composed of several parts:\n    *   **Coupling constants:** `alpha^3 * g^2`. `alpha` is the fine-structure constant (the electromagnetic coupling strength), and `g` is another coupling constant. The powers relate to the number and type of interaction vertices in the diagram.\n    *   **Numerical and group theory factors:** `sqrt(2) * 8`. These come from diagram symmetries, summing over spin states, and group theory factors (`SU(N)`, etc.).\n    *   **Loop integration factors:** `1/(4pi)^6`. This is a very characteristic factor that arises from integrating over the momenta of virtual particles in loops.\n    *   **Kinematic factors:** `(Q/M)^2`. This represents the result of the loop integration, which depends on external momenta (`Q`) and particle masses (`M`).\n\n3.  **Identify the loop-dependent term:**\n    The most direct way to determine the number of loops (`L`) is by analyzing the factor that comes from the loop integration measure. In dimensional regularization, which is a standard method for handling loop integrals, each loop integral in `D` spacetime dimensions contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(4pi)^(D/2)` to the amplitude.\n\n4.  **Apply the formula to the specific problem:**\n    *   The problem states the theory is on **four-dimensional spacetime**, so we set `D=4`.\n    *   For one loop (`L=1`) in `D=4`, the factor is `1/(4pi)^(4/2) = 1/(4pi)^2`.\n    *   For a diagram with `L` loops, this factor is raised to the power of `L`. So, the total loop factor is `(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L)`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the number of loops (L):**\n    *   The expression on the note contains the factor `1/(4pi)^6`.\n    *   We can equate this with the general formula for `L` loops: `1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`.\n    *   By comparing the exponents, we get the equation: `2L = 6`.\n    *   Solving for `L`, we find: `L = 3`.\n\n6.  **Consistency Check:**\n    The coupling constant factor is `alpha^3`. In many perturbative expansions in QFT (like the calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron), an `n`-loop contribution is proportional to `alpha^n`. The presence of `alpha^3` is therefore consistent with a 3-loop diagram, strengthening our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
