    "The user wants to find the total energy of a Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li) nucleus moving at 0.96c.\n\n**1. Determine the rest mass of the nucleus.**\n*   The nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   The atomic number (Z) of Lithium is 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   So, the nucleus is $^{6}$Li.\n*   To calculate the rest energy ($E_0 = m_0 c^2$), we need the rest mass ($m_0$) of the $^{6}$Li nucleus.\n*   We can look up the mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom and subtract the mass of its 3 electrons. The atomic mass of $^{6}$Li is approximately 6.015122795 u (atomic mass units).\n*   The mass of an electron is approximately 0.00054858 u.\n*   Mass of $^{6}$Li nucleus = Mass of $^{6}$Li atom - (3 * Mass of electron)\n    *   $m_0$ = 6.015122795 u - (3 * 0.00054858 u) = 6.013477055 u.\n*   The energy equivalent of 1 atomic mass unit (u) is 931.494102 MeV/c².\n*   Rest energy of the nucleus ($E_0$):\n    *   $E_0 = 6.013477055 \\text{ u} \\times 931.494102 \\text{ MeV/u} \\approx 5601.884 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the relativistic Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\n*   The nucleus travels at a speed (v) of 0.96c.\n*   The Lorentz factor is given by the formula: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\n*   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma E_0$.\n*   $E = 3.5714 \\times 5601.884 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20006.59 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The question asks for the energy in GeV (Giga-electron volts). 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n*   $E = 20006.59 \\text{ MeV} / 1000 = 20.00659 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nRounding the result to the precision of the options given (1e-4), we get 20.0066 GeV.\n\n**4. Check the options:**\nA) 20.132 GeV\nB) 21.419 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of ~20.007 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. Let's re-evaluate using a calculation that might match the source of the problem's options, possibly using approximate nucleon masses without subtracting binding energy.\n\n**Alternative Calculation (Approximation):**\n*   Mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is approximately 938 MeV/c².\n*   Rest mass of $^{6}$Li nucleus ≈ 6 nucleons * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV/c².\n*   Total Energy $E = \\gamma \\times (5628 \\text{ MeV}) = 3.5714 \\times 5628 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20099.7 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   $E \\approx 20.100 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThis value is even closer to option A. The small discrepancy (20.100 GeV vs 20.132 GeV) likely arises from using slightly different values for the nucleon mass (e.g., using a weighted average for protons and neutrons, or a specific rounded value used in a textbook). Regardless of the precise rest mass value used, the calculation consistently yields a result very near 20.1 GeV.\n\nGiven the choices, 20.132 GeV is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
