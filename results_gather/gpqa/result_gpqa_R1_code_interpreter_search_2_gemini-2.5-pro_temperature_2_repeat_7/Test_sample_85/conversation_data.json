    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product**\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **-pyran-**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A ketone (carbonyl group, C=O) is at position 2 of the ring.\n*   **lactone**: The structure is a cyclic ester. By convention, the ring oxygen is at position 1, and the adjacent carbonyl carbon is position 2.\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4.\n*   **Chirality**: The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it's bonded to four different groups (H, ethyl group, and two different paths around the ring). The product can exist as (R) or (S) enantiomers.\n\nThe product is a delta-lactone, which is formed by the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. In this case, the precursor must be a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid derivative.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\nThis is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. Let's draw its structure and number the carbon chain:\n`isobutyl-O-C(=O)(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-C(=O)(1)OH`\nThis molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an ester (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5). It also has a chiral center at C3, which has an ethyl group attached.\n\nThe two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** Reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It **does not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Reduces carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones. It **does not** typically reduce esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 is added to the starting material. It selectively reduces the **ester** group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**: `HO-CH2(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-C(=O)(1)OH`.\n    3.  Acid workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming a stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3). We must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents on the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starter (A):** Groups on C3 are H, Et, `G1 = -CH2(2)-COOH`, `G2 = -CH2(4)-COOiBu`. The priority is P(G1) > P(G2) because the atom three bonds away is O in G1 (-COOH) versus C in G2 (-COOiBu).\n    *   **Intermediate:** Groups on C3 are H, Et, `G1 = -CH2(2)-COOH`, `G2' = -CH2(4)-CH2OH`. The priority is P(G1) > P(G2') because G1 has a C attached to three oxygens (by CIP rules for C=O) while G2' has a C attached to one oxygen and two hydrogens.\n    *   Since the relative priority of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change, the stereochemical configuration is **retained**. An (R) starter gives an (R) product, and an (S) starter gives an (S) product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is (R), the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 is added to the starting material. It selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester group at C5 untouched.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-4-ethylpentanoate**: `isobutyl-O-C(=O)(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-CH2(1)OH`.\n    3.  Acid workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group at C1 attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, displacing isobutanol and forming the same six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction does not touch the chiral center C3 directly. We must check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starter (B):** Same as before. Groups on C3 are H, Et, `G1 = -CH2(2)-COOH`, `G2 = -CH2(4)-COOiBu`. Priority: P(G1) > P(G2).\n    *   **Intermediate:** Groups on C3 are H, Et, `G1' = -CH2(2)-CH2OH`, `G2 = -CH2(4)-COOiBu`. Now we compare the priorities of G1' and G2. P(G2) is higher than P(G1') because G2 has a C attached to O, O, C, while G1' has a C attached to O, H, H.\n    *   Notice that the original highest priority group (G1) has been transformed into a group (G1') with a lower priority than the original second-highest group (G2). The priority order of the two main substituents has **swapped**. This is a known phenomenon where a chemical transformation away from a chiral center causes an inversion of the R/S designation simply due to the change in CIP priorities. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is **inverted**. An (R) starter gives an (S) product, and an (S) starter gives an (R) product.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is (S), the starting material B must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both reactions must start with the same enantiomer.\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
