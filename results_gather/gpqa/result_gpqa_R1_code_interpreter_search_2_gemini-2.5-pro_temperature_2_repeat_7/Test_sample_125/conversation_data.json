    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two separate chemical reactions and the subsequent chromatographic analysis of the combined products.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reaction:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that already contains one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), with the (S) configuration. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   Reactant: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3` (Chiral center at C5)\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group `C=O` at C3 creates a `CH(OH)` group. The incoming hydride ion can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, leading to two possible stereochemical outcomes at C3: (R) or (S).\n\n2.  **Products:** Since the original molecule already has an (S) configuration at C5, the two possible products are:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement at one of their two chiral centers (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reaction:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This is a symmetrical, achiral molecule. It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) to secondary alcohols. This reaction creates two new chiral centers, one at C2 and one at C4.\n    *   Reactant: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3` (Achiral)\n    *   Product: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3` (Pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n2.  **Products and Stereochemistry:** We must determine the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. The molecule is symmetrical, meaning the groups attached to the central CH2 are identical (`CH3-CH(OH)-`). This symmetry affects the total number of unique stereoisomers. For a molecule with two chiral centers and this type of symmetry, we have three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (This is a **meso** compound, as it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of **enantiomers**. The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, the pair of enantiomers will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of **five** different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nNow we analyze this mixture of five compounds using two types of HPLC.\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   **Principle:** Separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. An achiral column cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are **diastereomers** (Compound 1 and 2). Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus **will be separated**. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II's products, the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are **enantiomers** (Compound 3 and 4). They are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound (Compound 5) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and **will be separated** from them, giving a distinct peak.\n    *   This means the three products from Reaction II will give rise to **2 peaks**.\n    *   Finally, the products of Reaction I (`C7H16O2`, a methoxy-alcohol) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (`C5H12O2`, a diol) and will have different retention times. Thus, there is no risk of accidental co-elution between the sets of products.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all compounds that a normal-phase column can, plus enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated by a chiral HPLC column, assuming the column is chosen appropriately for these compounds and provides sufficient resolution.\n    *   Compound 1 and 2 (diastereomers) will be separated.\n    *   Compound 3 and 4 (**enantiomers**) will also be separated.\n    *   Compound 5 (diastereomer to 3 and 4) will be separated from them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the five unique compounds will produce a separate peak. Total = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
