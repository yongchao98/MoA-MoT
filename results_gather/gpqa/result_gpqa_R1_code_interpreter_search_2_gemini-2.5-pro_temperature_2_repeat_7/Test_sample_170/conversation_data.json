    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination, on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-Z). The position of the incoming bromine atom (ortho, meta, or para) is determined by the nature of the existing substituent (Z). The question asks to arrange the compounds by the increasing yield of the *para*-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent as either ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n*   **Ortho/para-directors:** These groups activate (or weakly deactivate) the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to high yields of the para isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. They lead to very low yields of the ortho and para isomers.\n\nLet's classify the substituents for each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 (alkyl group) is an activating, ortho/para-director.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 (ester) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl (halogen) is a weakly deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 (nitro group) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 (alkyl group) is an activating, ortho/para-director.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH (carboxylic acid) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Initial Grouping**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups:\n*   **Low para yield group (meta-directors):** Nitrobenzene (4), Ethyl benzoate (2), Benzoic acid (6).\n*   **High para yield group (ortho/para-directors):** Toluene (1), Chlorobenzene (3), Ethylbenzene (5).\n\nThe final order will have all compounds from the low-yield group preceding the compounds from the high-yield group.\n\n**4. Ordering Within the Meta-Directors (4, 2, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of ortho and para products is always low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group makes ortho/para substitution even less likely. The deactivating strength follows this order:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxylic Acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the para-isomer yield will be lowest for the strongest deactivator and increase as the deactivating effect weakens:\nYield(para) of -NO2 < Yield(para) of -COOH < Yield(para) of -COOC2H5\nSo, the order for this group is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   (4) C6H5-NO2: Very low para yield (~0.3%)\n*   (6) C6H5-COOH: Low para yield (~1-2%)\n*   (2) C6H5-COOC2H5: Low, but higher than others (~5-7%)\n\n**5. Ordering Within the Ortho/Para-Directors (1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor these compounds, we are comparing the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by two main factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less crowded para position.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** Inductive effects can influence the relative reactivity of the ortho and para positions.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **1 (Toluene, -CH3) vs. 5 (Ethylbenzene, -C2H5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance in ethylbenzene leads to a higher proportion of the para product compared to toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with 3 (Chlorobenzene, -Cl):** The chlorine atom is a halogen. Halogens are ortho/para-directors but are deactivating. For halogens, the combination of steric bulk (a Cl atom is relatively large) and strong inductive deactivation at the nearby ortho positions strongly favors para substitution. The percentage of para-isomer in the bromination of chlorobenzene is very high (around 87-89%), which is generally higher than for simple alkylbenzenes. Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest para yield in this group. So, the order is **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the order for the high-yield group is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n*   (1) C6H5-CH3: High para yield (~62%)\n*   (5) C6H5-C2H5: Higher para yield due to sterics (~65-70%)\n*   (3) C6H5-Cl: Very high para yield due to sterics and electronics (~87%)\n\n**6. Final Ordering**\n\nBy combining the order of the two groups, we get:\n(Low para yield group) < (High para yield group)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete order of increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
