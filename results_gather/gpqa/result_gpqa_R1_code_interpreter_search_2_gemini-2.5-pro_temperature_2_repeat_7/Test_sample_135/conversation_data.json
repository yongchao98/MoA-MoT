    "This problem asks for the evaluation of a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. This is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field**\n\nThe vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. State the Problem**\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of `f(r)` over a sphere `V` of radius `R` centered at the origin:\n`Integral = ∫_V (∇ · f) dV`\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field over the boundary surface `S` of the volume `V`. The theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ · f) dV = ∮_S (f · dS)`\nwhere `dS` is the differential surface area vector.\n\n**Important Note on Singularity:**\nThe field `f(r) = r̂/r^2` is undefined (singular) at the origin `r=0`. The standard Divergence Theorem requires the field to be continuously differentiable throughout the volume. However, we can still apply the theorem by considering the surface integral. The physical interpretation (like Gauss's Law in electromagnetism) is that the singularity at the origin acts as a \"source\" of the field, and the flux through any surface enclosing it will be the same, regardless of the surface's shape or size, as long as it encloses the origin.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\n*   The surface `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The differential surface area vector `dS` on a sphere always points radially outward. So, `dS = dS * r̂`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n*   The vector field `f(r)` on the surface of the sphere (where `r=R`) is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   Now we compute the dot product `f · dS`:\n    `f · dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] · [dS * r̂]`\n    Since `r̂ · r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `f · dS = dS / R^2`\n\n*   Now, we perform the surface integral:\n    `∮_S (f · dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `R` is a constant over the entire surface of the sphere, `1/R^2` can be taken out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n*   The integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n*   Substituting this back in:\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ · f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as `R > 0` (i.e., the sphere encloses the singularity at the origin).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
