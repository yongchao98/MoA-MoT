    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Parameters:**\n    The problem specifies a rhombohedral crystal. The key parameters for a rhombohedral system are the lattice constant `a` (the length of the primitive lattice vectors) and the angle `α` between them.\n    *   Lattice vectors: `|**a**| = |**b**| = |**c**| = a`\n    *   Interaxial angles: `α = β = γ`\n\n    From the problem statement:\n    *   The interatomic distance, which corresponds to the lattice parameter `a`, is 10 Angstrom.\n    *   The angle `α` is 30°.\n    *   We need to find the interplanar distance `d_hkl` for the (hkl) = (111) plane.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Interplanar Spacing:**\n    The formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal is given by:\n    `1 / d_hkl² = [(h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²(α) - cos(α))] / [a²(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α))]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    The formula can be significantly simplified for planes of the type (hhh), such as (111).\n    Let's substitute `h = k = l` into the general formula.\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = h² + h² + h² = 3h²`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = h*h + h*h + h*h = 3h²`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `1 / d_hhh² = [3h²sin²(α) + 2(3h²)(cos²(α) - cos(α))] / [a²(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α))]`\n\n    The denominator can also be factored. The term `(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α))` is a known identity and can be written as `(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α))`.\n    Let's substitute this and `sin²(α) = 1 - cos²(α) = (1 - cos(α))(1 + cos(α))` into the equation.\n\n    `1 / d_hhh² = [3h²(1 - cos(α))(1 + cos(α)) + 6h²(cos²(α) - cos(α))] / [a²(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n    Factor out `cos(α)(cos(α) - 1)` which is `-cos(α)(1 - cos(α))` from the second term in the numerator's bracket.\n    `1 / d_hhh² = [3h²(1 - cos(α))(1 + cos(α)) - 6h²cos(α)(1 - cos(α))] / [a²(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n    Now, cancel out a `(1 - cos(α))` term from the numerator and denominator:\n    `1 / d_hhh² = [3h²(1 + cos(α)) - 6h²cos(α)] / [a²(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n    `1 / d_hhh² = [3h² + 3h²cos(α) - 6h²cos(α)] / [a²(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n    `1 / d_hhh² = [3h²(1 - cos(α))] / [a²(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n    Canceling `(1 - cos(α))` again, we get a much simpler formula for (hhh) planes:\n    `1 / d_hhh² = 3h² / [a²(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n    For the specific (111) plane, `h = 1`:\n    `1 / d_111² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values and Calculate:**\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    Substitute these into the simplified formula:\n    `1 / d_111² = 3 / [10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2))]`\n    `1 / d_111² = 3 / [100 * (1 + √3)]`\n\n    Now, solve for `d_111`:\n    `d_111² = [100 * (1 + √3)] / 3`\n    `d_111 = √([100 * (1 + √3)] / 3)`\n    `d_111 = 10 * √((1 + √3) / 3)`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Using the simplified formula: d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + cos(alpha)) / 3)\n# Error in formula used in previous thought cell. Re-deriving from 1/d^2.\n# 1/d_111^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)))\n# d_111^2 = (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha))) / 3\n# d_111 = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)\n\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nd_111_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * cos_alpha)) / 3\nd_111 = math.sqrt(d_111_squared)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n\nWait, my derivation for the simplified formula `1 / d_111² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cos(α))]` was correct. The error was in my mental re-derivation in the final Python block annotation. The code's logic is what I should re-verify against the correct formula.\n\nLet's re-write the code execution step based on the correct final formula `d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + sqrt(3)) / 3)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the derived formula: d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + sqrt(3)) / 3)\n# Let's re-calculate using this correct expression.\n\nvalue_inside_sqrt = (1 + math.sqrt(3)) / 3\nd_111 = 10 * math.sqrt(value_inside_sqrt)\nprint(d_111)\n\n```\nThe above code has a slight mistake in the formula being used `(1+cos(alpha))/3` when it should be `(1+2*cos(alpha))/3` in `d^2` calculation, and there's another mistake of having `sqrt(3)` inside the code `(1 + sqrt(3)) / 3` when the original formula has `cos(alpha)`. Let's retrace the steps.\nFormula: `1 / d_111² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cos(α))]`.\nSo `d_111² = a² * (1 + 2cos(α)) / 3`.\nSo `d_111 = a * sqrt( (1 + 2cos(α)) / 3 )`.\n\nLet's use a Python script to compute the final, correct numerical value from this correct formula.\n```python\nimport math\n\na = 10.0\nalpha_deg = 30.0\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Correct formula for d_111\n# d_111 = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)\nd_111 = a * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\nLet me manually re-calculate from my `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + sqrt(3)) ]` step.\n`d_111^2 = 100 * (1 + sqrt(3)) / 3`\n`sqrt(3) ~= 1.732`\n`d_111^2 = 100 * (1 + 1.732) / 3 = 100 * 2.732 / 3 = 273.2 / 3 = 91.067`\n`d_111 = sqrt(91.067) ~= 9.5429`\n\nMy formula derivation and manual calculation seem correct and consistent. I'll stick to that.\n\nThe python code `print(10 * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * math.cos(math.radians(30))) / 3))` is correct based on the derivation. Let's see the result.\n```python\nimport math\n\na = 10.0\nalpha_deg = 30.0\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\nd_111 = a * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3)\nprint(f\"{d_111:.2f}\")\n```\nIt appears I had multiple confusing versions of the final calculation step. Let me lay out the calculation clearly from the confirmed simplified formula `1 / d_111² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cos(α))]`.\n\n`d_111² = (a² * (1 + 2*cos(α))) / 3`\n`a = 10`, `a² = 100`\n`α = 30°`, `cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2`\n`d_111² = (100 * (1 + 2 * sqrt(3)/2)) / 3`\n`d_111² = (100 * (1 + sqrt(3))) / 3`\n`d_111 = sqrt(100 * (1 + sqrt(3)) / 3)`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + sqrt(3)) / 3)`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + 1.73205) / 3)`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt(2.73205 / 3)`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt(0.91068)`\n`d_111 = 10 * 0.954296`\n`d_111 = 9.54296`\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. This matches option B.\nFinal check of all reasoning and calculation shows consistency.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we will use the specific formula for this crystal system.\n\n**1. General Formula**\n\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system with lattice parameter `a` and interaxial angle `α`, the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` for a plane with Miller indices (hkl) is given by the formula:\n\n`1 / d_hkl² = [(h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²(α) - cos(α))] / [a²(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α))]`\n\nThe denominator `(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α))` can be factored into the more convenient form `(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α))`.\n\n**2. Simplification for the (111) Plane**\n\nFor the specific case of the (111) plane, we have `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`. Let's substitute these values into the formula:\n\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the numerator gives:\n`3sin²(α) + 2(3)(cos²(α) - cos(α)) = 3sin²(α) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\nUsing the identity `sin²(α) = 1 - cos²(α)`:\n`3(1 - cos²(α)) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α) = 3 - 3cos²(α) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α) = 3 + 3cos²(α) - 6cos(α) = 3(1 - 2cos(α) + cos²(α)) = 3(1 - cos(α))²`\n\nNow, substituting the simplified numerator and the factored denominator back into the main equation:\n`1 / d_111² = [3(1 - cos(α))²] / [a²(1 - cos(α))²(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\nWe can cancel the `(1 - cos(α))²` term from the numerator and the denominator, leading to a much simpler formula for (hhh) planes:\n`1 / d_111² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\nLet's solve for `d_111`:\nFirst, invert the formula:\n`d_111² = [a²(1 + 2cos(α))] / 3`\n`d_111 = a * sqrt[(1 + 2cos(α)) / 3]`\n\nNow substitute the values:\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[(1 + 2(√3 / 2)) / 3]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[(1 + √3) / 3]`\n\nTo get a precise numerical answer, let's use the provided code interpreter.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Lattice parameter in Angstrom\na = 10.0\n# Angle in degrees\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n# Convert angle to radians for trigonometric functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Use the simplified formula derived for the (111) plane\n# d_111 = a * sqrt[(1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3]\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nd_111 = a * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is `9.542974392310603`. Rounding this value to two decimal places gives `9.54`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 9.08 Angstrom\nB) 9.54 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
