    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The nature of this radiation can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The power and angular distribution of the radiation depend on the lowest-order non-vanishing oscillating multipole moment. The main possibilities are electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, etc.\n\nLet's analyze the most common cases which correspond to the options provided.\n\n### Case 1: Electric Dipole Radiation\n\nThis is the most common and typically the dominant form of radiation from a localized oscillating charge distribution, unless it is forbidden by specific symmetries. An arbitrary oscillation confined within a spheroidal volume will, in general, possess an oscillating electric dipole moment.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle with the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n    The function `f` mentioned in the problem is this power per unit solid angle: `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\n2.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, `A` corresponds to a factor of `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. At this angle, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n    `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the power at `90°`:\n    Fraction = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n3.  **Wavelength Dependence:**\n    The total power radiated by an electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴`. The power per unit solid angle `f(λ, θ)` also has this dependence.\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n    Therefore, the power dependence on wavelength is:\n    `f ∝ ω⁴ = (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    So, for electric dipole radiation, the fraction is **1/4** and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is **λ⁻⁴**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### Case 2: Electric Quadrupole Radiation\n\nThis form of radiation dominates only if the electric dipole moment of the system is zero due to symmetry. This is a more specific condition. For example, a symmetric pulsation of the spheroid (a \"breathing mode\") could lead to quadrupole radiation. The simplest form of linear quadrupole radiation has the following properties:\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence:**\n    For a linear electric quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n\n2.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The maximum power `A` occurs when `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` is maximum. This can be rewritten as `(1/4)sin²(2θ)`. The maximum occurs at `2θ = 90°`, i.e., `θ = 45°`.\n    Maximum value: `sin²(45°)cos²(45°) = (1/√2)² * (1/√2)² = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4`.\n    So, `A` corresponds to a factor of `1/4`.\n\n    The power at `θ = 30°` is proportional to `sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`.\n\n    The fraction is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power:\n    Fraction = `(3/16) / (1/4) = 12/16 = 3/4`.\n\n3.  **Wavelength Dependence:**\n    The power radiated by an electric quadrupole is proportional to `ω⁶`.\n    `f ∝ ω⁶ = (2πc/λ)⁶ ∝ 1/λ⁶ = λ⁻⁶`.\n\n    So, for linear electric quadrupole radiation, the fraction is **3/4** and the form is **λ⁻⁶**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have two physically possible scenarios, one leading to option A and one to option B. The key is to decide which is more \"possible\" or general for \"an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape\".\n\n*   Dipole radiation is the most general and lowest-order term. It is present unless forbidden by symmetry.\n*   Quadrupole radiation dominates only in the special case where the oscillating dipole moment is zero.\n*   The phrasing \"an oscillating charge distribution\" suggests a general case, not a specifically symmetric one that would cancel the dipole moment. Therefore, the dipole radiation model is the most plausible interpretation.\n\nFollowing the dipole radiation model:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at 30° is **1/4**.\n*   The dependence of radiated power on wavelength is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nTo calculate the fraction:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# For dipole radiation, power is proportional to sin(theta)^2\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(30)\npower_fraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\n# Maximum power is at theta = 90 degrees, where sin(90)^2 = 1.\n# The fraction is power_fraction / 1.\nprint(power_fraction)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.25\n</execute_code>\nThe code confirms the fraction is 0.25 or 1/4.\n\nFinal Answer reasoning:\nThe problem asks for the fraction of maximum radiated power at θ=30° and the wavelength dependence. Assuming the most general case of radiation, which is electric dipole radiation, the power is proportional to `sin²(θ)` and `λ⁻⁴`.\nThe maximum power `A` is at `θ=90°`, where `sin²(90°)=1`.\nAt `θ=30°`, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\nThe fraction of the maximum power is therefore `(1/4)/1 = 1/4`.\nThe wavelength dependence for dipole radiation is `λ⁻⁴`.\nTherefore, the correct choice combines the fraction `1/4` and the form `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for two things:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum radiated power (`A`) that is measured at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n2.  A possible functional form for the radiated power per unit solid angle (`f`) in terms of the wavelength `λ`.\n\nThe radiating source is an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape, symmetric about the z-axis. The radiation from such a source can be described by a multipole expansion. The lowest-order, non-vanishing multipole moment will dominate the radiation. The most general and common case is electric dipole radiation. Higher-order terms like electric quadrupole radiation only dominate if the electric dipole moment is zero due to some specific symmetry in the oscillation.\n\nLet's first assume the most general case, which is **Electric Dipole Radiation**. This would happen, for example, if the spheroid of charge is oscillating up and down along the z-axis.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n2.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the equatorial plane).\n    So, the maximum power `A` is proportional to `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. At this angle, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n3.  **Wavelength Dependence:**\n    The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴`. The power per unit solid angle, `f`, also has this dependence: `f ∝ ω⁴`.\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n    `f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    So, based on the electric dipole radiation model, the fraction is **1/4** and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\nFor completeness, let's consider the case of **Electric Quadrupole Radiation**. This would be the dominant form if the electric dipole moment were zero (e.g., a \"breathing mode\" oscillation of the spheroid).\n*   **Angular Dependence:** For a linear electric quadrupole along the z-axis, `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. The maximum power occurs at `θ = 45°`. The power at `θ = 30°` is `sin²(30)cos²(30) = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16`. The maximum power (at 45°) is `sin²(45)cos²(45) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 = 4/16`. The fraction would be `(3/16)/(4/16) = 3/4`.\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** Quadrupole radiation power is proportional to `ω⁶`, which means it is proportional to `λ⁻⁶`.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nHowever, since the problem describes a generic \"oscillating charge distribution,\" the most natural and general assumption is that it possesses an oscillating electric dipole moment, making dipole radiation the dominant mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is derived from the electric dipole model.\n\n*   Fraction of maximum power at 30° = **1/4**\n*   Possible form of wavelength dependence = **λ⁻⁴**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
