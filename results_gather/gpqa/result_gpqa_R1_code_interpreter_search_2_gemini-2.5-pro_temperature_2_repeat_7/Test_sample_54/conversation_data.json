    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integrations**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals:\n*   A signal at 2.1 ppm with an integration of 3H.\n*   A signal at 1.6 ppm with an integration of 3H.\n*   A signal at 5.5 ppm with an integration of 1H.\n*   A signal at 7.0 ppm with an integration of 1H.\n\nThe total number of protons observed is 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 8 protons.\n\nLet's compare this with the number of protons in the possible molecules:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH₃. Total protons = 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The molecular formula has 10 protons. This does not match the integration data. Common isomers like 1-butenyl acetate (CH₃CH₂CH=CHOAc) or 2-butenyl acetate (CH₃CH=CHCH₂OAc) also have 10 protons.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and D). The unknown compound must be either cis- or trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal's Chemical Shift and Splitting Pattern**\n\nLet's assign each signal to the protons in the propenyl acetate structure: CH₃(c)-CH(a)=CH(b)-O-C(=O)CH₃(d).\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group). This corresponds to the protons of the acetate methyl group, -O-C(=O)CH₃(d).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl group.\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** This methyl group has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. This assignment is consistent.\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond. This corresponds to the CH₃(c) group.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl group.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** This indicates that the methyl protons are coupled to one adjacent proton. This proton must be H(a). This type of coupling over four bonds is called allylic coupling.\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinyl region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom of the acetate group. This signal corresponds to proton H(b).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Confirms it's a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** This proton is split by the other vinyl proton, H(a). The coupling constant between them is J = 16.0 Hz.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinyl region. This corresponds to proton H(a).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Confirms it's a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (dq, doublet of quartets):** This complex splitting pattern arises from coupling to two different sets of protons:\n        *   It is split into a **doublet** by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n        *   It is further split into a **quartet** by the three protons of the allylic methyl group CH₃(c).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (³J) between the two vinyl protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n*   The signal for H(b) at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   For protons on a double bond:\n    *   A **trans** arrangement typically shows a large coupling constant, ³J_trans = 12-18 Hz.\n    *   A **cis** arrangement typically shows a smaller coupling constant, ³J_cis = 6-12 Hz.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the range for trans-coupling. This indicates that the two vinyl protons, H(a) and H(b), are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the proton count, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and particularly the large vinylic coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
