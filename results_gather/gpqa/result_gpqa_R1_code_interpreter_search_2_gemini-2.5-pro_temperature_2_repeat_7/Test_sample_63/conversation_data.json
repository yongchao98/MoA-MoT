The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.200 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted. The mass of O₂ is 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After water and oxygen are removed, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\n    *   The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n    *   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.100 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards the reagents is most likely nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of approximately 28.02 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Deduce the identity of salts A and B.**\n    *   The products of the decomposition are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This indicates the original salts contained Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n    *   The fact that no solid residue was left suggests salts that decompose completely into gases. Ammonium salts of oxygen-containing nitrogen acids are prime candidates.\n    *   Consider the thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):\n        *   `NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)`\n        *   `2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)` (Decomposition at ~200-250°C)\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the equimolar mixture consists of salt A = NH₄NO₂ and salt B = NH₄NO₃. Let `n` be the number of moles of each salt in the mixture.\n    *   The combined reaction would produce:\n        *   **From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂:** `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n        *   **From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃:** We scale the balanced equation. `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ would produce `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Total moles of products:**\n        *   Total Moles N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n        *   Total Moles H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n        *   Total Moles O₂ = `0.5n`\n\n4.  **Solve for `n` using the experimental data.**\n    *   We know: Moles(N₂) = 0.100 mol, Moles(H₂O) = 0.200 mol, Moles(O₂) = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Using the O₂ data: `0.5n = 0.025` mol ⇒ `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   Using the N₂ data: `2n = 0.100` mol ⇒ `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   Using the H₂O data: `4n = 0.200` mol ⇒ `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   The value of `n = 0.05` mol is consistent for all products, confirming our hypothesis.\n\n5.  **Verify the initial mass of the mixture.**\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total Mass = (n × M(NH₄NO₂)) + (n × M(NH₄NO₃))\n    *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n    *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the given initial mass perfectly.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The problem asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₂. Number of atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₃. Number of atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n```python\n# Double-checking the final calculation for the number of atoms.\n# Salt A: NH4NO2\natoms_N_A = 2\natoms_H_A = 4\natoms_O_A = 2\ntotal_atoms_A = atoms_N_A + atoms_H_A + atoms_O_A\n\n# Salt B: NH4NO3\natoms_N_B = 2\natoms_H_B = 4\natoms_O_B = 3\ntotal_atoms_B = atoms_N_B + atoms_H_B + atoms_O_B\n\n# Total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt\ntotal_atoms = total_atoms_A + total_atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Total atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Observations**\n\n*   **Heating Salts:** An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, with a total weight of 7.20 g, is heated. It decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This suggests the salts are likely ammonium salts of volatile acids.\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a dehydrating agent. Its weight increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of water (H₂O) was produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.200 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This solution tests for acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). Since its weight didn't change, no acidic gases were formed.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The weight increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen produced.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After removing H₂O and O₂, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains. At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.100 mol.\n*   **Identify Gas C:** The total mass of products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we find the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.100 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This indicates the original salts contained the elements H, O, and N. Given that they are salts that decompose completely into gases, they are likely ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200°C):** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   Or for one mole: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt (A and B).\n*   **From n moles of NH₄NO₂:** produces n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   **From n moles of NH₄NO₃:** produces n moles of N₂ and 0.5n moles of O₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products produced:**\n*   **Total Moles N₂:** n + n = 2n\n*   **Total Moles O₂:** 0.5n\n*   **Total Moles H₂O:** 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow we use our experimental values to solve for 'n':\n*   From N₂: 2n = 0.100 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.200 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming that salts A and B are indeed NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n**3. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol\n*   Total Mass = (n × Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂) + (n × Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃)\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol)\n*   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g\nThis matches the initial weight given in the problem.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms\n*   **Total Atoms:** 8 + 9 = 17\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
