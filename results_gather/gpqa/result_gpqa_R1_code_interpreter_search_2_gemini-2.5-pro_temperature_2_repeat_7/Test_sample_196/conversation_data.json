    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is a classic indicator of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very deshielded (downfield), broad singlet for one proton is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two chemically different sets of aromatic protons split each other, resulting in two doublets. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is further downfield, indicating it's adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to the other substituent.\n    *   **Combining the remaining signals to identify the second substituent (an alkyl group):**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group and another proton.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine (-CH-) group. Its chemical shift around 2.9 ppm is typical for a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon attached to the benzene ring). This methine proton is coupled to the protons of the adjacent methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm signal) and the methylene group (from the 1.7 ppm signal), which explains why it's a multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have a central methine carbon (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring. This CH is also attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This entire group is a **sec-butyl** group, -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Based on all the evidence, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n1.  **The Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n2.  **The Reaction:** The combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of a wide range of oxygen-containing functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, down to the corresponding alkanes.\n3.  **Applying the reaction to Compound X:**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the -COOH at position 4 of the benzene ring is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   The sec-butyl group remains at position 1.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Final Product:**\n    The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material, Compound X)\n\nThe calculated final product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
