    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with one equivalent of bromine, typically in an acidic medium like acetic acid, to replace one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom. Since both α-carbons of cyclohexanone are equivalent, the reaction yields a single product.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis step involves the reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). This set of conditions is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Sodium hydroxide, a strong base, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the carbon on the other side of the carbonyl group (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbon bearing the bromine atom (C2), displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻). This forms a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic intermediate, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n    4.  This strained intermediate collapses by breaking one of the bonds to the original carbonyl carbon. The C1-C6 bond breaks (rather than the C1-C2 bond) because this leads to the formation of a more stable primary carbanion at C6 (as opposed to a less stable secondary carbanion at C2).\n    5.  The resulting carbanion is protonated during aqueous workup to give the final product. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group attached.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl₂ / pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. This is its classic application.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Let's analyze its structure to count the number of sets of chemically equivalent hydrogens.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n```\n      H(a)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n    H(b)-C1\n       /  \\\n H(c),H(d)-C2--C5-H(c),H(d)\n          |    |\n H(e),H(f)-C3--C4-H(e),H(f)\n```\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H(a) and C=O), the C1 carbon, the H(b) attached to it, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n\n2.  **Chirality and Diastereotopicity:** The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter (it's bonded to four different groups: H, the CHO group, C2, and C5). This has important consequences for the hydrogens on the ring.\n    *   Any CH₂ group in a molecule containing a chiral center is \"prochiral\", and its two geminal protons are \"diastereotopic\", meaning they are in chemically non-equivalent environments. They will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Counting the distinct hydrogen environments:**\n    *   **Type 1:** The aldehyde proton, **H(a)**. This is a unique environment. (1 proton)\n    *   **Type 2:** The proton on C1, **H(b)**. This is also unique. (1 proton)\n    *   **Type 3 & 4:** The two protons on C2, **H(c)** and **H(d)**. Because C1 is a stereocenter, these two protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C5 are equivalent to those on C2. So, we have two sets of equivalent protons here. (2 protons in environment c, 2 protons in environment d)\n    *   **Type 5 & 6:** The two protons on C3, **H(e)** and **H(f)**. They are also diastereotopic due to the influence of the distant chiral center at C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. By symmetry, the protons on C4 are equivalent to those on C3. So, we have another two sets of equivalent protons. (2 protons in environment e, 2 protons in environment f)\n\nIn total, there are **6** distinct chemical environments for the hydrogen atoms:\n1.  H(a)\n2.  H(b)\n3.  H(c)\n4.  H(d)\n5.  H(e)\n6.  H(f)\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
