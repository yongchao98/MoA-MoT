    "My thinking process to solve this problem involves several distinct steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Initial State (Dilution)**\nFirst, I need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n-   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n-   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n-   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n-   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n-   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, I can calculate the new concentration (M2).\n    -   Moles of acetic acid = M1 × V1 = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 / 1000) L = 0.001 mol\n    -   New concentration (M2) = Moles / V2 = 0.001 mol / (40.00 / 1000) L = 0.025 M.\nSo, we are titrating a 0.025 M acetic acid solution.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Titration Reaction**\nThe reaction is between a weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH):\nCH₃COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) → CH₃COONa (aq) + H₂O (l)\nThis means that for every mole of NaOH added, one mole of CH₃COOH is converted into its conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻ (in the form of sodium acetate).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n-   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.\n-   At this stage, the solution contains both the unreacted weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its newly formed conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). This is a buffer solution.\n-   The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n-   First, I need the pKa of acetic acid: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n-   At 25% titration, the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is 25% / (100% - 25%) = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n-   So, pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n-   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added exactly equal the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n-   At this point, all the CH₃COOH has been converted to CH₃COO⁻. The solution contains only sodium acetate.\n-   Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so its solution will be basic due to the hydrolysis of the acetate ion: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n-   To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of OH⁻ produced by this hydrolysis.\n    1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (V_eq):** Moles of acid = Moles of base => (0.025 M) × (0.040 L) = (0.1 M) × V_eq.\n    2.  **Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:** Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + V_eq.\n    3.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point:** [A⁻] = Initial moles of acid / Total Volume.\n    4.  **Use the hydrolysis equilibrium to find [OH⁻]:** The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    5.  Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / ([A⁻] - x). Assuming x is small, we can approximate [OH⁻] = x ≈ √(Kb × [A⁻]).\n    6.  **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log([OH⁻]).\n    7.  **Calculate pH:** pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the calculations**\nTo ensure accuracy, I will use a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given constants and initial values ---\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 20.00 / 1000  # L\nfinal_vol_acid = 40.00 / 1000 # L\nconc_NaOH = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Concentration after dilution ---\nmoles_of_acid = initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid\nconc_acid_diluted = moles_of_acid / final_vol_acid\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% titration ---\n# For a buffer solution, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\nratio_25_percent = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_25_percent)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at equivalence point ---\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_of_acid / conc_NaOH\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = final_vol_acid + vol_NaOH_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nconc_acetate_eq = moles_of_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n# [OH-] concentration from hydrolysis: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Acetate])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate_eq)\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the final answer:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nFirst, we need to find the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, where:\n*   M₁ = Initial concentration = 0.05 M\n*   V₁ = Initial volume = 20.00 cm³\n*   V₂ = Final volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   M₂ = Final concentration\n\nM₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% remains as unreacted acetic acid. This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n\n1.  **Find pKa:**\n    Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n2.  **Find the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid]:**\n    At 25% titration, the ratio is 25/75 or 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate. The solution now contains only sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so its solution will be basic due to the hydrolysis of the acetate ion:\nCH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of acid initially present:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00/1000 L) = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:**\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction.**\n    We need the Kb for the acetate ion:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    The equilibrium expression is Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    Kb = x² / ([CH₃COO⁻] - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate [CH₃COO⁻] - x ≈ [CH₃COO⁻].\n    x² = Kb × [CH₃COO⁻] = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n    So, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. These values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
