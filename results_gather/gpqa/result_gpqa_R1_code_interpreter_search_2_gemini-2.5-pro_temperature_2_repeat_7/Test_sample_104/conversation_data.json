    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n    The star's brightness varies because of its rotation. We observe a different brightness when the unspotted hemisphere faces us compared to when the hemisphere with spots faces us.\n    *   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the clean, unspotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. The flux is determined by the star's effective temperature, `T_eff`. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, flux is proportional to `T^4`. So, `F_max ∝ T_eff^4`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the hemisphere covered in spots is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a filling factor `f` of 0.20 (or 20%). This means 20% of its surface has the cooler spot temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining 80% (`1-f`) has the normal photosphere temperature `T_eff`.\n    The flux from this face is a weighted average of the two temperatures: `F_min ∝ (1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot Signal**\n    The amplitude of the variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux. We'll define this relative to the maximum flux, as this is analogous to how a transit depth is measured.\n    Amplitude = `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    Substituting the proportionalities from step 1 (the constants of proportionality cancel out):\n    Amplitude = `(T_eff^4 - [(1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4]) / T_eff^4`\n    Amplitude = `(T_eff^4 - T_eff^4 + f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n    Amplitude = `(f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n    Amplitude = `f * (1 - T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)`\n    Amplitude = `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n3.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit Signal**\n    The problem asks for the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal on an identical, but spotless, star. When an exoplanet transits a star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    Transit Depth = `Area_planet / Area_star = (π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2) = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n    Here, `Rpl` is the planet's radius and `Rstar` is the star's radius.\n\n4.  **Equate the Signals and Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius**\n    To find the equivalent planet size, we set the amplitude of the spot signal equal to the transit depth.\n    `(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n    `Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4))`\n\n5.  **Plug in the Values and Calculate**\n    *   `f` = 0.20\n    *   `T_eff` = 6000 K\n    *   `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nNow, let's use a Python script to perform the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000.0  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# The fractional flux drop caused by the spots is given by:\n# delta_F / F = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n# This is equivalent to the transit depth of a planet, which is (R_planet / R_star)**2\n# So, we can write:\n# (Rpl / Rstar)**2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Calculate the term inside the parenthesis\ntemp_ratio_term = 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4\n\n# Calculate the squared relative radius\nrpl_rstar_squared = f * temp_ratio_term\n\n# Calculate the relative radius by taking the square root\nrpl_rstar = math.sqrt(rpl_rstar_squared)\n\nprint(rpl_rstar)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3217930816053351\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value for the relative radius `Rpl/Rstar` is approximately 0.3218. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Understanding the problem:**\n\nThe goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl`) relative to its star's radius (`R_star`) that would produce a brightness drop equal to the one caused by spots on a rotating star.\n\n**2. Flux Variation from Starspots:**\n\nThe brightness of the star changes due to its rotation, showing one hemisphere with spots and one without. The observed flux (brightness) is proportional to the fourth power of temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: `Flux ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This happens when the unspotted hemisphere faces us. The entire visible surface is at the star's effective temperature, `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This happens when the hemisphere with spots faces us. A fraction `f` (the filling factor) of this face is covered by cooler spots (`T_spot`), and the rest `(1-f)` is at `T_eff`.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n**3. Calculating the Amplitude of the Spot Signal:**\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional drop in flux, calculated relative to the maximum flux.\n\nAmplitude = `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\n\nAmplitude = `(T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f)T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\nAmplitude = `(T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\nAmplitude = `(f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\nAmplitude = `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**4. Modeling the Exoplanet Transit Signal:**\n\nWhen an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the starlight. The fractional drop in brightness is called the transit depth, and it is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nTransit Depth = `Area_planet / Area_star`\nTransit Depth = `(π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\nTransit Depth = `(R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**5. Equating the Signals and Solving:**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size that produces the *same* amplitude signal. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the spot amplitude.\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nTo find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we take the square root of both sides:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) ]`\n\n**6. Plugging in the Values:**\n\n*   Star effective temperature (`T_eff`) = 6000 K\n*   Spot filling factor (`f`) = 20% = 0.20\n*   Spot temperature difference = 1000 K, so `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
