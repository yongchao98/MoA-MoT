    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compute the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, denoted as $L_1/L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $R$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the surface temperature of the star in its rest frame.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):** To find the luminosity ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the temperatures of the two stars. The problem provides a key piece of information: \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest...are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$).\n\n5.  **Apply Wien's Displacement Law:** In the rest frame of a star, Wien's displacement law relates the emitted peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) to its temperature ($T$):\n    $ \\lambda_{em} = \\frac{b}{T} $\n    where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Shift:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) can be different from the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) relative to the observer. This phenomenon is called the Doppler effect. The relativistic Doppler shift formula relates the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n    $ \\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}} $\n    where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio for the Two Stars:**\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is given as $v_{r1} = 0$. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift.\n        $ \\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1} = \\frac{b}{T_1} $\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n        $ \\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}} = \\left(\\frac{b}{T_2}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}} $\n\n8.  **Use the Equality of Observed Wavelengths:** Since the problem states that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n    $ \\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}} $\n    Canceling $b$ from both sides and rearranging to find the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$:\n    $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}} $\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now substitute this expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}}\\right)^4 $\n    $ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\\right)^2 $\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:** The final step is to plug in the values and calculate the result. The information about the masses ($M_1=1.5M_2$) is irrelevant for this calculation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5  # Ratio of radii\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458    # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of radial velocity to the speed of light\nv_over_c = vr2 / c\n\n# Calculate the square of the temperature ratio\n# (T1/T2)^2 = (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)\ntemp_ratio_sq = (1 - v_over_c) / (1 + v_over_c)\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * ((T1/T2)^2)^2\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (temp_ratio_sq)**2\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n2.229080649733475\n\nThe calculation gives a value of approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$ L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4 $\nwhere $L$ is the luminosity, $R$ is the radius, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the surface temperature in the star's rest frame.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1/T_2$.
