    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept**\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt or τ), its energy (E) is not perfectly defined but has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE). This relationship is expressed as:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). As an approximation for the minimum uncertainty, we can use:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThis means that a state with a shorter lifetime will have a larger spread or uncertainty in its energy.\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each of the two quantum states using their given lifetimes (τ).\n\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n*   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   **For state 1:**\n    ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For state 2:**\n    ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. The Condition for Resolving the Energy Levels**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference between their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂). If the energy difference is smaller than this sum, the energy distributions of the two states will overlap too much to be seen as separate.\n\n*   **Condition:** |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nLet's calculate the total uncertainty:\n\n*   Total Uncertainty = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   Total Uncertainty = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Total Uncertainty = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   Total Uncertainty ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nTherefore, the required energy difference must be significantly greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options**\n\nWe now check which of the given options satisfies this condition: |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is even smaller. Not resolvable.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. These levels can be clearly resolved.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is extremely small. Not resolvable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only energy difference that is large enough to allow for the clear resolution of the two energy levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
