    "An atomic nucleus with an initial rest-mass energy of `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV` is at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2. We are given the following information:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (The more massive fragment, m1, is twice as massive as the lighter one, m2).\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n3.  The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1.\n\nWe need to find the difference between the correct relativistic value of T1 and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments**\n\nFrom the given mass relations, we can write the equivalent relations for rest-mass energies (`E = m*c^2`):\n- `E_m1 = m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 2 * E_m2`\n- `E_m1 + E_m2 = (m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M * c^2 = 0.99 * E_initial`\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n`2 * E_m2 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_initial`\n`3 * E_m2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n`E_m2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, we can find `E_m1`:\n`E_m1 = 2 * E_m2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies of the fragments are 198 GeV (for the more massive one) and 99 GeV (for the lighter one).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)**\n\nThe Q-value is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energy. This difference is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2`).\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\nThis gives the relation: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the correct T1 using relativistic mechanics**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is `E = T + m*c^2` and the energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n\nLet `E1` and `E2` be the total energies of the fragments. By conservation of energy:\n`E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV`\n\nBy conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2 = p`. Therefore, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`E1^2 - (E_m1)^2 = E2^2 - (E_m2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (E_m1)^2 - (E_m2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (E_m1)^2 - (E_m2)^2`\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\n`E1 - E2 = (39204 - 9801) / 300 GeV = 29403 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for E1 and E2:\n1. `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2. `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `E_m1`:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - E_m1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Step 5: Find the difference**\n\n`ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n`ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# All energies are in GeV.\n\n# Given values\nE_initial = 300.0  # Rest mass energy of the initial nucleus\n\n# Calculate rest mass energies of the fragments\n# From the problem statement: m1 = 2*m2 and m1+m2 = 0.99*M.\n# This implies E_m1 = 2*E_m2 and E_m1+E_m2 = 0.99*E_initial.\nE_m_total = 0.99 * E_initial\n# 3 * E_m2 = E_m_total => E_m2 = E_m_total / 3\nE_m2 = E_m_total / 3.0\nE_m1 = 2.0 * E_m2\n\n# Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\nQ = E_initial - E_m_total\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1 = 1/2 => T2_c = 2*T1_c\n# T1_c + T2_c = Q => 3*T1_c = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# From conservation of energy: E1 + E2 = E_initial\n# From conservation of momentum: p1 = p2 => E1^2 - E_m1^2 = E2^2 - E_m2^2\n# (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = E_m1^2 - E_m2^2\n# E1 - E2 = (E_m1^2 - E_m2^2) / E_initial\nE1_minus_E2 = (E_m1**2 - E_m2**2) / E_initial\n# Solving the system of equations for E1: 2*E1 = E_initial + E1_minus_E2\nE1 = (E_initial + E1_minus_E2) / 2.0\nT1_relativistic = E1 - E_m1\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Difference (MeV): {difference_MeV}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nDifference (MeV): 5.0\n</execute_result>\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value of T1 and the classically calculated value is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, meaning its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy.\n`E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments, m1 and m2.\nThe problem states:\n1.  The more massive fragment is twice the mass of the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`. In terms of rest-mass energy: `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2`.\n2.  The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. In terms of rest-mass energy: `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_initial`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the rest-mass energies `E_m1` and `E_m2`:\n1.  `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2`\n2.  `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2 * E_m2) + E_m2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * E_m2 = 297 GeV`\n`E_m2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow find `E_m1`:\n`E_m1 = 2 * E_m2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `E_m1 = 198 GeV`, and the lighter one is `E_m2 = 99 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value).**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T1 + T2`). It is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1_c = p2_c = p_c`.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Therefore, `p^2 = 2mT`.\n`p_c^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p_c^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\nThis means `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`, or `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1 / 2`, which implies `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the correct (relativistic) mechanics.**\n\nFrom conservation of total energy (since the initial nucleus was at rest):\n`E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV`\nwhere `E1` and `E2` are the total relativistic energies of the fragments (`E = T + mc^2`).\n\nFrom conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2 = p`):\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n`(pc)^2 = E1^2 - E_m1^2`\n`(pc)^2 = E2^2 - E_m2^2`\nTherefore, `E1^2 - E_m1^2 = E2^2 - E_m2^2`.\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = E_m1^2 - E_m2^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = E_m1^2 - E_m2^2`\n\nSubstitute the known values `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`, `E_m1 = 198 GeV`, and `E_m2 = 99 GeV`:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300) = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we solve the system of linear equations for `E1`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300.00 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 =  98.01 GeV`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 398.01 / 2 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy `T1_relativistic` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `E_m1`:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - E_m1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the difference.**\n\nThe difference between the relativistic value and the classical value is:\n`ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nTo convert this to MeV, we use the conversion factor 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n`ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<A>>>"
