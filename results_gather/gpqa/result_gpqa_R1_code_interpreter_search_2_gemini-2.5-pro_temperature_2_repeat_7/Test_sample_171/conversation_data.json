    "This problem requires us to relate the temperatures of two stars based on the relative excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key physical principle is the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among their various energy levels when in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:**\n    The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy state (j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (i) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n    \n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    \n    Where:\n    *   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in energy levels j and i, respectively.\n    *   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of those levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (E_j - E_i).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying the Equation to Each Star:**\n    Let's define the ratio `R = N_j / N_i` as the measure of excitation for the specific energy levels in question.\n\n    For star_1 with temperature `T_1`:\n    R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\n    For star_2 with temperature `T_2`:\n    R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n3.  **Using the Information from the Problem:**\n    The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as those in star_2. This means the population ratio `R` for star_1 is twice that for star_2:\n    \n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n    Now, we substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n    \n    (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    The term `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars since it's a property of the iron atom's energy levels, so it cancels out:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures:**\n    To solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, we rearrange the terms to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n5.  **Substituting Numerical Values:**\n    The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE` as approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n    ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing this result with the given options, it perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
