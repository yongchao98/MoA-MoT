    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information from the problem statement:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two groups attached, having the core formula C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This means the molecule contains at least two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. In a di-substituted benzene ring, this suggests a symmetric substitution pattern (like para) and indicates there are 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n        *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is very characteristic of a specific arrangement. A proton that is split into a doublet (d) is coupled to one other proton. A proton split into a doublet of quartets (dq) is coupled to two different sets of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This strongly points to a propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl (-CH=CH-**CH3**) identified above. The other signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n2.  **Piece together the structure from the spectral data:**\n    *   **Core:** A di-substituted benzene ring. This accounts for **C6H4**.\n    *   **Substituent 1 (from vinyl-H signals):** The doublet and doublet of quartets pattern is explained by a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3. Let's verify: The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is coupled to one other vinyl proton, giving a doublet. The second vinyl proton is coupled to the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group contributes **C3H5** to the formula and has no -CH2- groups. It also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals.\n    *   **Substituent 2 (from ester and other -CH3 signal):** This substituent must be an ester group, contain the second -CH3 group, and contain no -CH2- groups. There are two common possibilities:\n        *   A methyl ester group attached to the ring: -COOCH3.\n        *   An acetate group attached to the ring: -OCOCH3.\n        In both cases, the atoms contributed by this substituent are **C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   Sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result against the given options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C11H14O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n5.  **Confirm by eliminating other options:**\n    Let's check the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for the options. The structure we deduced (aromatic ring + one C=C + one C=O) has a DBE of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 5. (Incorrect DBE)\n    *   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 7. (Incorrect DBE)\n    *   D) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n\n    We are left with options A and D. To have the formula C12H14O2 instead of C11H12O2, we would need to add one carbon and two hydrogens (a -CH2- group). However, the problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH2- groups. Therefore, C12H14O2 is inconsistent with the data.\n\nConclusion: The only formula that fits all the evidence from the FTIR and NMR spectra is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
