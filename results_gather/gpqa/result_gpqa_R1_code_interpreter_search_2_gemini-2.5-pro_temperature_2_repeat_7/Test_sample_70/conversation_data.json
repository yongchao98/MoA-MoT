    "Here is a breakdown of the thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, denoted as T_4 / T_2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the host star.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the host star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_4 / T_2.\n    `T_4 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    `T_2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\n    When we divide T_4 by T_2, several terms will cancel out because they are the same for both planets:\n    *   `T_star` (same star)\n    *   `R_star` (same star)\n    *   `A` (same albedo, as stated in the problem)\n    *   The constant `2`\n\n    So the ratio simplifies to:\n    `T_4 / T_2 = [(R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2)] / [(R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2)]`\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (a_4)^(-1/2) / (a_2)^(-1/2)`\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)` or `T_4 / T_2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Orbital Period:** We don't have the values for the semi-major axes (`a`), but we do have information about the orbital periods (`P`). We can use Kepler's Third Law to connect these two quantities. Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    `P² ∝ a³` or `P²/a³ = constant`\n\n    Therefore, we can write:\n    `(P_2)² / (a_2)³ = (P_4)² / (a_4)³`\n\n    We need to find the ratio `a_2 / a_4`. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    `(a_2)³ / (a_4)³ = (P_2)² / (P_4)²`\n    `(a_2 / a_4)³ = (P_2 / P_4)²`\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Substitute Back into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now we substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_4` back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)`\n    `T_4 / T_2 = [(P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)]^(1/2)`\n\n    Using the power of a power rule `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`:\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   Period of Planet_2 (`P_2`) corresponds to the value `2`.\n    *   Period of Planet_4 (`P_4`) corresponds to the value `3.5`.\n\n    So, the ratio `P_2 / P_4` is `2 / 3.5`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now we compute the final numerical answer.\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    To make the calculation easier, we can write 3.5 as 7/2.\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (2 / (7/2))^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3)`\n\n    This requires a calculator. I will use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n# The formula derived is (P2/P4)^(1/3), where P2=2 and P4=3.5 from the given ratio.\np_ratio = 2 / 3.5\ntemp_ratio = p_ratio**(1/3)\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which can be written as T_4 / T_2.\n\n**2. The Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the energy it receives from the star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Temperature of the star\n*   R_star = Radius of the star\n*   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n*   A = Albedo of the planet (reflectivity)\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio T_4 / T_2. Let's write out the formulas for each planet:\nT_4 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)\nT_2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)\n\nWhen we divide T_4 by T_2, several terms cancel out:\n*   T_star and R_star are the same for both planets because they orbit the same star.\n*   The albedos (A_4 and A_2) are the same, as stated in the problem.\n*   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n\nThis simplifies the ratio to:\nT_4 / T_2 = [(1/a_4)^(1/2)] / [(1/a_2)^(1/2)]\nT_4 / T_2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n**4. Relate Semi-major Axis (a) to Orbital Period (P)**\nWe are given the orbital periods (P), not the semi-major axes (a). We can connect them using Kepler's Third Law, which states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\nP² ∝ a³\nThis means P² / a³ is a constant for all planets in the system.\nTherefore:\n(P_4)² / (a_4)³ = (P_2)² / (a_2)³\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the ratio a_2 / a_4:\n(a_2)³ / (a_4)³ = (P_2)² / (P_4)²\n(a_2 / a_4)³ = (P_2 / P_4)²\na_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n**5. Combine the Equations**\nNow substitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) back into our temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\nT_4 / T_2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\nT_4 / T_2 = [(P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)]^(1/2)\n\nUsing the power of a power rule `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`, we get:\nT_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\nThe problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n*   The relative period for Planet_2 (P_2) is 2.\n*   The relative period for Planet_4 (P_4) is 3.5.\n\nNow, we plug these values into our final formula:\nT_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nThe code output shows that this calculation yields approximately 0.8298, which rounds to 0.83. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
