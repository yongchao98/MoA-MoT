    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to find the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. To do this, we need to know the speed of the ejecta and the time elapsed, both measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (this is the proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Concepts:**\n    The problem involves two different inertial reference frames. Due to the high speed, we must consider the effects of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). The time interval `Δt` measured in the stationary frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the moving frame by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effect and is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n3.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio β = v/c.**\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor γ.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n        We are given `Δt₀ = 50 s`. Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n        The distance is the speed (in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (also in the Galaxy's frame).\n        `Distance = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km. This is very close to option D.\n\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer in classical physics, ignoring relativity)\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculation based on special relativity yields a result that matches option D. The previous code execution, using a more precise value for the speed of light, gave a result of 3,061,950 km, which also strongly points to option D being the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
