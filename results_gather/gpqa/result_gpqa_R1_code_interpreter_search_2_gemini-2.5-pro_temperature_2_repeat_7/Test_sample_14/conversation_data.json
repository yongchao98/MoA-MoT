    "This problem requires us to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understand the Transit Probability Formula**\n\nThe geometric probability of an exoplanet transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_s`) to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (`a`), assuming the orbit is circular and the planet's radius is negligible compared to the star's.\n\n`Probability (P_transit) = R_s / a`\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities**\n\nWe don't know the semi-major axis (`a`) directly, but we can relate it to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`) using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. For a planet with mass much smaller than its star (`m_p << M_s`), the law simplifies to:\n\n`P² ≈ (4π² / G * M_s) * a³`\n\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\n`a³ ≈ (G * M_s * P²) / (4π²)`\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides gives:\n\n`a ≈ [ (G * M_s * P²) / (4π²) ] ^ (1/3)`\n\nSince `G` and `4π²` are constants, we can establish a proportionality:\n\n`a ∝ (M_s * P²) ^ (1/3)`\n\n**3. Combine Formulas to Find the Probability Relationship**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `a` back into the transit probability formula:\n\n`P_transit ∝ R_s / [ (M_s * P²) ^ (1/3) ]`\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n`P_transit ∝ R_s * M_s ^ (-1/3) * P ^ (-2/3)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`P_transit1`) to that of Planet_2 (`P_transit2`):\n\n`Ratio = P_transit1 / P_transit2`\n\n`Ratio = [ R_s1 * M_s1^(-1/3) * P_1^(-2/3) ] / [ R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P_2^(-2/3) ]`\n\nWe can group the terms:\n\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3)`\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nLet's plug in the information provided in the question:\n*   Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`, so `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n\n`Ratio = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * (3^(-1))^(-2/3)`\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n`Ratio = (3^2)^(1/3) / (2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9)^(1/3) / (2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n**6. Compute the Numerical Value**\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator to compute the cube root of 4.5.\n```python\nimport math\n\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n>\n>1.650963595648737\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately **1.65**.\n\nSince the ratio `P_transit1 / P_transit2` is `~1.65`, this means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The probability of a planet transiting its star, for a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the stellar radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (`P_transit = R_s / a`).\n\nWe can relate the semi-major axis (`a`) to the orbital period (`P`) and the stellar mass (`M_s`) using Kepler's Third Law:\n`P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n\nRearranging to solve for `a`:\n`a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n`a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the transit probability formula:\n`P_transit ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n`P_transit ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the probability for Planet_1 (`P_transit1`) to that of Planet_2 (`P_transit2`):\n`Ratio = P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n1.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2` => `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n2.  The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` => `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`\n3.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3` => `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio equation:\n`Ratio = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * (3^(-1))^(-2/3)`\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n`Ratio = (3²) / (2))^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`Ratio ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred object to observe.\n\n<<<C>>>"
