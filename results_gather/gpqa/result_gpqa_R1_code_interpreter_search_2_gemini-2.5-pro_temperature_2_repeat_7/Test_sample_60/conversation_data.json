    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the synthesis reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Product 1**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Process:** Benzene reacts with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). The sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst, protonating the nitric acid to form the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is a strong electrophile. This electrophile attacks the benzene ring.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene. A nitro group (-NO₂) is attached to the benzene ring. The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group and acts as a meta-director for subsequent electrophilic substitutions.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (Nitrobenzene) + Br₂/Fe powder → Product 2**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Process:** Nitrobenzene is treated with bromine (Br₂) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, which is generated in situ from iron powder (Fe) and bromine (Fe + Br₂ → FeBr₃). The catalyst polarizes the bromine molecule, creating a strong electrophile (Br⁺).\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a deactivating and meta-directing group. This means it directs the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to the meta position (position 3) on the benzene ring relative to itself.\n*   **Product 2:** 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene) + H₂/Pd/C → Product 3**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Process:** The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine group (-NH₂) using hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This is a standard method for reducing nitroarenes to anilines. The bromine atom is unaffected by these conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-bromoaniline (or m-bromoaniline). The -NH₂ group is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) + NaNO₂/HBF₄ → Product 4**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Diazotization.\n*   **Process:** The primary aromatic amine (3-bromoaniline) is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and fluoroboric acid (HBF₄) at low temperatures (typically 0-5 °C). This converts the amino group (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺). The counter-ion is the tetrafluoroborate anion (BF₄⁻) from the acid.\n*   **Product 4:** 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. This is an aryldiazonium salt, which is a versatile intermediate in organic synthesis.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 + Anisole, with heating → Product 5 (Final Product)**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction (Aryl-Aryl Coupling).\n*   **Process:** The aryldiazonium salt (Product 4) is gently heated in the presence of another aromatic compound, anisole (methoxybenzene). The heating causes the diazonium salt to decompose, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂) and forming a highly reactive 3-bromophenyl radical or cation. This reactive species then attacks the anisole ring.\n*   **Directing Effect:** Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH₃), which is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director due to its electron-donating resonance effect. The incoming 3-bromophenyl group will preferentially add to the para position (position 4) because it is electronically activated and sterically less hindered than the ortho positions.\n*   **Final Product 5:** The coupling reaction joins the 3-bromophenyl group to the 4-position of the anisole ring, forming a biphenyl skeleton. The resulting molecule has a bromine atom at position 3 of one ring and a methoxy group at position 4' of the other ring.\n*   **Name:** 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\nComparing this final product to the given options:\nA) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect position for the methoxy group.\nB) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect substituent (Fluoro instead of methoxy). This would be the result of a Schiemann reaction without subsequent coupling to anisole.\nC) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - This matches the derived structure and name.\nD) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect position for the bromine atom, which would have required para-direction in Step 2.\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions leads to 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
