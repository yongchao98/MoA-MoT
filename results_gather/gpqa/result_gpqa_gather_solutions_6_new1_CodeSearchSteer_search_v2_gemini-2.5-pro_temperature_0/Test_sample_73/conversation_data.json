The most critical feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** This property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age\" or become more likely to decay over time. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant information for calculating its future decay probability. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly formed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set Up the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is the complement of survival: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n        `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can solve this without explicitly finding `λ` by using the properties of exponents and the value found in the previous step:\n        `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Substitute the known value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n        `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   Now, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated probability is `0.4393`, which is `43.93%`. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 44%\n    *   B) 52%\n    *   C) 48%\n    *   D) 40%\n    The value `43.93%` is closest to `44%`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Key:** The most common trap in this type of problem is to incorrectly use the \"50 minutes\" of survival time. Recognizing that this information is extraneous due to the memoryless nature of the decay is the crucial first step.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability:** It is essential to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The exponential term `e^(-λt)` represents survival. The given 32% decay probability must be converted to a 68% survival probability to be used correctly in the formula.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The most efficient and accurate method avoids explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ`, which can introduce rounding errors. Relating the exponents as shown in Step 5 (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) is the preferred approach.\n*   **Final Answer Mapping:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the physics and math were almost universally correct, many failed to map the final numerical result (44%) to the correct lettered option. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final step. The correct answer is 44%, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a comprehensive step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The decay of a single atomic nucleus is a random quantum process that follows an exponential distribution.

The atom does not \"age\" or become more likely to decay over time. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant information. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   Let `S(t)` be the probability that the atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t`. This is given by the formula: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom decays within a time `t`. This is the complement of the survival probability: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   From the survival formula, we have the key relationship: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   We can find the value of `e^(-150λ)` by using the relationship from the previous step and the properties of exponents:\n        `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the value we found: `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   Next, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    *   The calculated probability is 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        *   A) 52%\n        *   B) 48%\n        *   C) 40%\n        *   D) 44%\n    *   The value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Crucial:** The most common trap in this type of problem is to be misled by the information about the time that has already passed (the 50 minutes). Recognizing that this information is irrelevant due to the memoryless nature of the decay is the most critical step.\n*   **Distinguish Decay vs. Survival Probability:** The exponential term `e^(-λt)` directly represents the probability of *survival*. The question asks for the probability of *decay*, which is `1 - S(t)`. It is a common mistake to calculate the survival probability and forget to subtract it from 1.\n*   **Avoid Explicitly Calculating the Decay Constant (λ):** It is more direct, elegant, and less prone to rounding errors to manipulate the exponential term as a whole (e.g., `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than solving for `λ` itself.\n*   **Correctly Map the Final Answer:** As evidenced by the discrepancies in the candidate answers, even with a correct calculation, it is possible to select the wrong letter.

The most critical characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. All candidate answers correctly identify this as the key principle.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** This property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of its past history.

A key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age\" or become more likely to decay simply because it has survived for a certain period.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question:** Because the process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The question can be simplified to: \"What is the probability that a newly formed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is the complement of the survival probability: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find a key parameter for our atom.\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n        `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can use the properties of exponents to relate this to the value we found in the previous step. Notice that `150 = 100 * 1.5`.\n    *   `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Now, we substitute the value from Step 4:\n        `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** The probability of decay is `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`. The code execution from the previous step confirms the result:\n    *   `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n    *   The calculated probability is 43.93%.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical concept. The information that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous and designed to test the understanding of this principle. Any attempt to use this information in a complex conditional probability calculation would be an over-complication.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability:** It is essential to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`.
