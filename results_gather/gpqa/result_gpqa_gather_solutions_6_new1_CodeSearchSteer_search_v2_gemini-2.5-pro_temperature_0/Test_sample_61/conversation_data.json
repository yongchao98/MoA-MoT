Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. Specifically, it is the product formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n**3. Devise the Synthesis for the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nTo convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), we need to modify the alkyne and then cleave it. A standard and effective method is ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne to set up the correct cleavage point. The acidic proton of ethynylcyclohexane is removed by a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to add a methyl group. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne is then reduced to an alkene. To avoid over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is required. **Lindlar's catalyst** (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent for this, reducing the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`) followed by a **reductive workup** (e.g., with dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`). This is critical to break the double bond and yield two aldehydes: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde. An oxidative workup would yield carboxylic acids, which cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n\n**4. Plan the Final Reaction (Stage 2)**\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde produced in Stage 1 is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the target β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we can evaluate each option against this chemically sound pathway:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol...**: This sequence is incorrect. In Step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride... 3. O₃/ H₂O...**: This sequence is incorrect. Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O`), which would produce carboxylic acids instead of the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**: This sequence perfectly matches our derived strategy. Step 1 is alkylation. Step 2 is partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst. Step 3 is reductive ozonolysis to form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Step 4 is a base-catalyzed aldol reaction. **This sequence is chemically correct.**\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd...**: This sequence is incorrect. Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison, which would fully reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane, making the subsequent steps impossible.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C is the only one that provides a chemically viable pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must break down the synthesis into logical steps, analyzing the transformation from the starting material to the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure, a β-hydroxy aldehyde, is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. Specifically, it is formed when two molecules of an intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**, react with each other in a self-condensation reaction.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Stage 1:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n### Step 3: Devise the Synthesis for the Intermediate (Stage 1)\n\nTo convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), we need to change the functional group and shorten the carbon chain by one carbon. A reliable method for this involves modifying the alkyne and then cleaving it via ozonolysis.\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** The terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne to set up the correct cleavage point. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne proton with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. To avoid over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is required. Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent used to reduce an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). A **reductive workup** (using dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`) is essential to obtain aldehydes as the products. An oxidative workup would yield carboxylic acids, which cannot undergo the final aldol reaction. This step yields the desired intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow, we can evaluate each option against this chemically sound pathway:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol...**: This sequence is incorrect from the first step. The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**: This sequence perfectly matches our derived strategy.\n    *   Step 1 is a correct alkylation.\n    *   Step 2 is a correct partial reduction using Lindlar's catalyst.\n    *   Step 3 is a correct reductive ozonolysis to form the aldehyde intermediate.\n    *   Step 4 is a correct base-catalyzed aldol reaction.\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd...**: This sequence is incorrect. Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison, which would fully reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane, making the subsequent steps impossible.\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O...**: This sequence is incorrect. Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O`), which would produce carboxylic acids instead of the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option B provides a chemically correct and logical pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. The product is formed when two molecules of an intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**, react with each other in the presence of a base.\n*   **Overall Goal:** The synthesis must first convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Then, this intermediate must undergo a self-aldol reaction.\n\n**2. Devise the Synthetic Pathway**\n\nTo convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, a multi-step process is required that involves modifying the alkyne and then cleaving a carbon-carbon bond.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The terminal alkyne must be converted to an internal alkyne to set up the correct cleavage point. The acidic proton of ethynylcyclohexane is removed by a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to add a methyl group. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne is then reduced to an alkene. To avoid over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is required. **Lindlar's catalyst** (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent used to reduce an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). A **reductive workup** with a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is essential. This breaks the double bond to yield two aldehydes: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (the desired intermediate) and acetaldehyde. An oxidative workup would incorrectly produce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), to catalyze the self-aldol addition reaction, forming the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option based on the correct pathway derived above.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**\n    *   This is incorrect. `NaNH₂` is a strong base that will react with the acidic proton of the methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...**\n    *   This is incorrect. Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison. This is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, making the subsequent ozonolysis step impossible.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches our derived synthetic plan. It correctly performs alkylation, partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, reductive ozonolysis to form the aldehyde intermediate, and finally, a base-catalyzed aldol reaction. **This is the correct answer.**\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O...**\n    *   This is incorrect. Step 3 uses `O₃/H₂O`, which is an oxidative workup for ozonolysis. This would produce carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction.\n\n```python\n# Final Answer Determination\n\n# The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n# This product is a result of a self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n# The synthesis must first create cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and then perform the aldol reaction.\n\n# The correct pathway is:\n# 1.

Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key feature is the acidic proton on the terminal alkyne carbon.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** By mentally reversing the aldol reaction, we can identify the precursor molecule. The bond formed in an aldol reaction is between the α-carbon of one molecule and the carbonyl carbon of another. Breaking this bond reveals that the precursor for the final step is two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n*   **Overall Goal:** The synthesis must first convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and then perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol reaction on this intermediate.\n\n**2. Devise a Synthetic Plan for the Intermediate (Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThis transformation requires changing the functional group and cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain. A reliable method to synthesize an aldehyde is through the ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point, we first need to add a carbon to the terminal alkyne. This is achieved by deprotonating the alkyne with a strong base (like `NaNH₂`) to form an acetylide anion. This anion then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with an alkyl halide (like `methyl chloride`, `CH₃Cl`) to form an internal alkyne: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`.\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene, not an alkane. **Lindlar's catalyst** (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent used to reduce an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene and stop the reaction at that stage. This yields `(Z)-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a **reductive workup** (using `(CH₃)₂S` or `Zn/H₂O`) is essential. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O` or `H₂O₂`) would produce carboxylic acids, which is not desired. This cleavage yields the desired intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, along with acetaldehyde.\n\n**3. Plan the Final Aldol Reaction**\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde produced in the previous step is treated with a base (e.g., `Ba(OH)₂`, `NaOH`) to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the target β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option against this chemically sound plan.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, which is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that would reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane. The alkane is unreactive and cannot be used in subsequent steps. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 uses `NaNH₂` with methanol. `NaNH₂` is a very strong base and will react with the acidic proton of methanol in an acid-base reaction, rather than performing the desired alkylation of the alkyne. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is ozonolysis followed by a workup with `H₂O`. This is an oxidative workup, which would produce carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde needed for the final aldol reaction. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4.

This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. As correctly identified by all candidate answers, this structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. The precursor for this reaction is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. The reaction involves two molecules of this precursor condensing in the presence of a base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Overall Synthetic Strategy:**\n    The synthesis must be broken down into two main stages:\n    *   **Stage 1:** Synthesize the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, from the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane.\n    *   **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n3.  **Devise the Pathway for Stage 1 (Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde):**\n    *   This transformation requires changing the functional group and shortening the carbon chain by one atom (from a C₂ alkyne side chain to a C₁ aldehyde side chain).\n    *   A standard method to create an aldehyde is through the ozonolysis of an alkene. Therefore, the alkyne must first be converted into a suitable alkene.\n    *   To obtain cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) via ozonolysis, we need to cleave an alkene of the structure `C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-R`. A simple choice for R is a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n    *   The synthesis of this alkene from the starting alkyne proceeds as follows:\n        *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The terminal alkyne is deprotonated with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to form an internal alkyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n        *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne is reduced to an alkene. To prevent over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is used. This selectively produces a *cis*-alkene.\n        *   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`) followed by a **reductive workup** (e.g., with dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`). This is crucial to obtain aldehydes as products. This step yields the desired cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n4.  **Devise the Pathway for Stage 2 (Aldol Addition):**\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Reaction.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde produced in Stage 1 is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the final target product.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct sequence of reagents is:\n1.  `NaNH₂, methyl chloride`\n2.  `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`\n3.  `O₃/ (CH₃)₂S`\n4.  `Ba(OH)₂`\n\nLet's match this correct sequence with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1.

The ozonolysis workup with `H₂O` is oxidative and would produce carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde.\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...** Incorrect. `H₂/Pd` is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that would reduce the alkyne completely to an unreactive alkane.\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some confusion in the lettering of the options they were given, unanimously agree on the chemical reasoning that leads to this specific sequence being the only correct one.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must devise a logical synthetic pathway from the starting material to the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane.

A robust method to achieve this involves the ozonolysis of a carefully prepared alkene.\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** The terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. The acidic proton is removed by a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to add a methyl group. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne is then reduced to an alkene. To avoid over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is required. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent for this transformation, reducing the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`).

The product is formed when two molecules of an aldehyde react with each other in the presence of a base.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis on the final product, we can identify the precursor molecule. The aldol reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of one molecule and the carbonyl carbon of another. Breaking this bond reveals that the necessary intermediate is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Overall Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Formation of the Intermediate:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Final Reaction:** Perform a self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n### Step 3: Devising the Synthesis of the Intermediate\n\nTo convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a multi-step pathway is required that involves cleaving a carbon-carbon bond. A standard and effective method is ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** The first step is to convert the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne. This is achieved by deprotonating the acidic alkyne proton with a strong base, such as sodium amide (`NaNH₂`), to form an acetylide anion. This anion then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with an alkyl halide, like methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to add a methyl group. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. To prevent reduction all the way to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is used. Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent for this, as it selectively reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n3.  **Ozonolysis with Reductive Workup:** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a reductive workup (using dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`) is essential. An oxidative workup would yield carboxylic acids, which would not work for the final step. This ozonolysis step yields the desired intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, along with acetaldehyde.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against this chemically sound pathway:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O:** This sequence is incorrect because Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, a strong catalyst that would fully reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH:** This sequence is incorrect. Step 3 uses an oxidative workup for ozonolysis (`O₃/ H₂O`), which would produce carboxylic acids instead of the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction.\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH:** This sequence is incorrect from the start. In Step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2:** This sequence perfectly matches the required synthetic plan.\n    1.  Correct alkylation of the terminal alkyne.\n    2.  Correct partial reduction to a *cis*-alkene using Lindlar's catalyst.\n    3.  Correct reductive ozonolysis to produce the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    4.  Correct use of a base (`Ba(OH)₂`) to catalyze the final aldol addition.\n\nBased on this analysis, option D is the only one that describes a chemically correct and logical pathway.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must break down the synthesis into logical steps, starting from the final product and working backward (retrosynthesis), and then evaluate the proposed options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Final Product:** The target molecule is **1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. This structure, a β-hydroxy aldehyde, is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. The reaction involves two molecules of an aldehyde precursor. By mentally reversing the aldol reaction, we can identify this precursor as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. Therefore, the primary goal of the synthesis is to first prepare cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, and then induce the aldol reaction.\n\n2.  **Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde):**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`)\n    *   **Intermediate:** Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`)\n    *   This transformation requires removing one carbon atom from the side chain (`-C≡CH` to `-CHO`). A standard method to achieve this is by modifying the alkyne and then cleaving it using ozonolysis.\n    *   **Step 2a: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic terminal proton with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n    *   **Step 2b: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. To prevent reduction all the way to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is required. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the specific reagent for this, converting the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 2c: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a **reductive workup** (using dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`) is essential. This cleavage yields the desired intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, along with acetaldehyde.\n\n3.  **Plan the Final Step (Aldol Addition):**\n    *   The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde formed in the previous step is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), to catalyze the self-aldol addition reaction, forming the final target product.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nNow, we can evaluate the given options against this correct, multi-step pathway.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol...**: This is incorrect. The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd...**: This is incorrect.

Deconstruct the Goal of the Synthesis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This specific structure is the result of a **self-aldol addition reaction** between two molecules of an aldehyde intermediate.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** To form the final product, we must first synthesize **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`Cyclohexyl-CHO`). The overall strategy is therefore a two-stage process:\n    1.  Convert ethynylcyclohexane to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    2.  Induce a self-aldol reaction on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**2. Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)**\n\n*   The starting material has an 8-carbon skeleton (C₆ ring + C₂ alkyne), while the intermediate has a 7-carbon skeleton (C₆ ring + C₁ aldehyde). This means a carbon atom must be cleaved off.\n*   A standard method to form an aldehyde is via the **ozonolysis of an alkene**. To get `Cyclohexyl-CHO`, we need to cleave an alkene of the structure `Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-R`. The simplest choice for `R` is a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n*   The synthesis of this alkene from the starting alkyne proceeds as follows:\n    *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The acidic proton of the terminal alkyne is removed by a strong base (like `NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide (like `CH₃Cl`) to add the methyl group, forming an internal alkyne (`Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`).\n    *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. To prevent over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is used. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the specific reagent for this, converting the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`). A **reductive workup** (using `(CH₃)₂S`) is critical to obtain aldehydes. An oxidative workup would yield carboxylic acids, which cannot undergo an aldol reaction. This step produces the desired cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**3. Plan the Final Aldol Reaction**\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde formed in the previous step is treated with a base (like `Ba(OH)₂`) to catalyze the self-aldol reaction, yielding the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n**4.

This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that describes a chemically correct and logical synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a self-**aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an aldehyde.\n*   **Key Insight:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis on the final product, we can identify the precursor molecule. The aldol reaction forms a new bond between the α-carbon of one molecule and the carbonyl carbon of another. Breaking this bond reveals that the precursor for the final step is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2.

Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThe conversion of ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) requires a change in the functional group and a change in the carbon skeleton (from a C₂ side chain to a C₁ side chain). A robust method to achieve this is through ozonolysis of a carefully prepared alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point for ozonolysis, we must first convert the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic terminal proton with a strong base (like `NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with an alkyl halide (like `CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage. **Lindlar's catalyst** (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent for this, as it is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that selectively reduces alkynes to *cis*-alkenes and prevents over-reduction to alkanes. This step yields (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a **reductive workup** (using a reagent like dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`) is essential.

This step breaks the alkene, yielding the desired cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    *   `(Z)-C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃ + 1. O₃; 2. (CH₃)₂S → C₆H₁₁-CHO + CH₃CHO`\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), which catalyzes the aldol addition reaction to form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### **4. Evaluation of the Given Options**\n\nLet's match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂:** This sequence perfectly matches the four necessary steps outlined above: alkylation, partial reduction, reductive ozonolysis, and base-catalyzed aldol addition. **This is the correct sequence.**\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; ...:** This is incorrect. Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, which would fully reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane, making the synthesis fail.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; ...:** This is incorrect. In Step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; ... 3. O₃/ H₂O; ...:** This is incorrect. Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O`), which would produce carboxylic acids instead of the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis, the sequence in option A is the only one that is chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must devise a logical synthetic plan that transforms the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the final product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and Final Product\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The proton on the terminal carbon is acidic.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. A retrosynthetic analysis reveals that this product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of an intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Overall Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Formation of the Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Final Reaction:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to yield the final product.\n\n### Step 3: Devising the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)\n\nTo convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), we need to change the functional group and shorten the carbon chain by one carbon. A reliable method for this is ozonolysis of a carefully chosen alkene.\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** First, the terminal alkyne is converted to an internal alkyne. The acidic proton is removed by a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to add a methyl group. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne is then reduced to an alkene. To avoid over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is essential. Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the standard reagent for reducing an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (`O₃`). A **reductive workup** with a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is critical to obtain aldehydes as the products. An oxidative workup would yield carboxylic acids, which would not work for the final step. This step successfully yields the required intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Provided Options\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this correct synthetic pathway.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the devised plan. Step 1 is alkylation. Step 2 is partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst. Step 3 is reductive ozonolysis to form the aldehyde intermediate. Step 4 is a base-catalyzed aldol reaction to form the final product. **This sequence is chemically correct.**\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   This sequence is incorrect. In Step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   This sequence is incorrect. In Step 2, `H₂/Pd` is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, making the subsequent steps impossible.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   This sequence is incorrect. In Step 3, the ozonolysis is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`), which is an oxidative workup. This would produce carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde needed for the final aldol reaction.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only sequence that provides a chemically sound and logical pathway to the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis of 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, a careful, step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation is required.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The proton on the terminal carbon of the alkyne is acidic.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This functional group arrangement is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** By mentally reversing the aldol reaction, we can identify the precursor molecule. The reaction involves the formation of a new bond between the α-carbon of one aldehyde and the carbonyl carbon of another. Breaking this bond reveals that the required intermediate for the final step is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. The overall synthesis is the self-addition of two molecules of this intermediate.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Formation of the Intermediate:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Final Aldol Reaction:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n### Step 3: Devise the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)\n\nThis transformation requires changing the functional group and shortening the carbon chain by one carbon. A reliable method to achieve this is through ozonolysis of a specifically prepared alkene.\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** The first step is to add a methyl group to the terminal alkyne. This is achieved by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base, such as sodium amide (`NaNH₂`), to form a nucleophilic acetylide anion. This anion then reacts with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`) to form an internal alkyne, 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. To prevent reduction all the way to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is necessary. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the specific reagent used to reduce an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The resulting alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a **reductive workup** (using dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`) is crucial. An oxidative workup would yield carboxylic acids, which would not work in the final step. This ozonolysis step produces the desired cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde as a byproduct.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow, we can evaluate each option based on this sound chemical plan:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the derived strategy. It correctly performs alkylation, partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, reductive ozonolysis to form the aldehyde intermediate, and finally, a base-catalyzed aldol addition. **This pathway is chemically correct.**\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   This sequence is incorrect. In step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic proton of the methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   This sequence is incorrect. In step 2, `H₂/Pd` is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that would reduce the alkyne completely to an unreactive alkane, making the subsequent ozonolysis impossible.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   This sequence is incorrect. In step 3, the ozonolysis is followed by a workup with water (`H₂O`), which constitutes an oxidative workup. This would produce carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, only option A provides a chemically viable and logical route to the target product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The final step is a base-catalyzed aldol reaction (Ba(OH)2).\n5. Only option C provides this chemically correct sequence.\nThe correct choice is C.\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key feature is the acidic proton on the terminal alkyne carbon.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** By mentally reversing the aldol reaction, we can identify the precursor molecule. The bond formed in an aldol reaction is between the α-carbon of one molecule and the carbonyl carbon of another. Breaking this bond reveals that the precursor for the final step is two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n*   **Overall Goal:** The synthesis must first convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and then perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol reaction on this intermediate.\n\n**2. Devise a Synthetic Plan for the Intermediate (Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThis transformation requires changing the functional group and cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain. A reliable method to synthesize an aldehyde is through the ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point, we first need to add a carbon to the terminal alkyne. This is achieved by deprotonating the alkyne with a strong base (like `NaNH₂`) to form an acetylide anion. This anion then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with an alkyl halide (like `methyl chloride`, `CH₃Cl`) to form an internal alkyne: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`.\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene, not an alkane. **Lindlar's catalyst** (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent used to reduce an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene and stop the reaction at that stage. This yields `(Z)-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a **reductive workup** (using `(CH₃)₂S` or `Zn/H₂O`) is essential. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O` or `H₂O₂`) would produce carboxylic acids, which is not desired. This cleavage yields the desired intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, along with acetaldehyde.\n\n**3. Plan the Final Aldol Reaction**\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde produced in the previous step is treated with a base (e.g., `Ba(OH)₂`, `NaOH`) to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the target β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option against this chemically sound plan.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, which is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that would reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane. The alkane is unreactive and cannot be used in subsequent steps. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 uses `NaNH₂` with methanol. `NaNH₂` is a very strong base and will react with the acidic proton of methanol in an acid-base reaction, rather than performing the desired alkylation of the alkyne. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is ozonolysis followed by a workup with `H₂O`. This is an oxidative workup, which would produce carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde needed for the final aldol reaction. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correctly performs alkylation to form `Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correctly uses Lindlar's catalyst to form the *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correctly uses reductive ozonolysis to form `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correctly uses a base (`Ba(OH)₂`) to catalyze the final aldol addition reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence perfectly matches the required synthetic pathway.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct multi-step synthesis pathway to convert ethynylcyclohexane into 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. As correctly identified by all candidate answers, this structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. The precursor for this reaction is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. The reaction involves two molecules of this precursor condensing in the presence of a base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Overall Synthetic Strategy:**\n    The synthesis must be broken down into two main stages:\n    *   **Stage 1:** Synthesize the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, from the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane.\n    *   **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n3.  **Devise the Pathway for Stage 1 (Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde):**\n    *   This transformation requires changing the functional group and shortening the carbon chain by one atom (from a C₂ alkyne side chain to a C₁ aldehyde side chain).\n    *   A standard method to create an aldehyde is through the ozonolysis of an alkene. Therefore, the alkyne must first be converted into a suitable alkene.\n    *   To obtain cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) via ozonolysis, we need to cleave an alkene of the structure `C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-R`. A simple choice for R is a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n    *   The synthesis of this alkene from the starting alkyne proceeds as follows:\n        *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The terminal alkyne is deprotonated with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to form an internal alkyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n        *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne is reduced to an alkene. To prevent over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is used. This selectively produces a *cis*-alkene.\n        *   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`) followed by a **reductive workup** (e.g., with dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`). This is crucial to obtain aldehydes as products. This step yields the desired cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n4.  **Devise the Pathway for Stage 2 (Aldol Addition):**\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Reaction.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde produced in Stage 1 is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the final target product.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct sequence of reagents is:\n1.  `NaNH₂, methyl chloride`\n2.  `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`\n3.  `O₃/ (CH₃)₂S`\n4.  `Ba(OH)₂`\n\nLet's match this correct sequence with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1.

A robust method to achieve this involves the ozonolysis of a carefully prepared alkene.\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** The terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. The acidic proton is removed by a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to add a methyl group. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne is then reduced to an alkene. To avoid over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is required. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent for this transformation, reducing the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). A **reductive workup** (using dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`) is essential to break the double bond and yield two aldehydes: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (the desired intermediate) and acetaldehyde.

The aldol reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of one molecule and the carbonyl carbon of another. Breaking this bond reveals that the necessary intermediate is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Overall Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Formation of the Intermediate:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Final Reaction:** Perform a self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n### Step 3: Devising the Synthesis of the Intermediate\n\nTo convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), a multi-step pathway is required that involves cleaving a carbon-carbon bond. A standard and effective method is ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** The first step is to convert the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne. This is achieved by deprotonating the acidic alkyne proton with a strong base, such as sodium amide (`NaNH₂`), to form an acetylide anion.

The overall strategy is therefore a two-stage process:\n    1.  Convert ethynylcyclohexane to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    2.  Induce a self-aldol reaction on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**2. Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)**\n\n*   The starting material has an 8-carbon skeleton (C₆ ring + C₂ alkyne), while the intermediate has a 7-carbon skeleton (C₆ ring + C₁ aldehyde). This means a carbon atom must be cleaved off.\n*   A standard method to form an aldehyde is via the **ozonolysis of an alkene**. To get `Cyclohexyl-CHO`, we need to cleave an alkene of the structure `Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-R`. The simplest choice for `R` is a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n*   The synthesis of this alkene from the starting alkyne proceeds as follows:\n    *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The acidic proton of the terminal alkyne is removed by a strong base (like `NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide (like `CH₃Cl`) to add the methyl group, forming an internal alkyne (`Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`).\n    *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene.

Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a self-**aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an aldehyde.\n*   **Key Insight:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis on the final product, we can identify the precursor molecule. The aldol reaction forms a new bond between the α-carbon of one molecule and the carbonyl carbon of another. Breaking this bond reveals that the precursor for the final step is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Stage 1:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n**3. Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThe conversion of ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) requires a change in the functional group and a change in the carbon skeleton (from a C₂ side chain to a C₁ side chain). A robust method to achieve this is through ozonolysis of a carefully prepared alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point for ozonolysis, we must first convert the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic terminal proton with a strong base (like `NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with an alkyl halide (like `CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage. **Lindlar's catalyst** (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent for this, as it is a \"poisoned\" catalyst that selectively reduces alkynes to *cis*-alkenes and prevents over-reduction to alkanes. This step yields (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a **reductive workup** (using a reagent like dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`) is essential. An oxidative workup would produce carboxylic acids, which cannot undergo an aldol reaction. This step cleaves the alkene to yield the desired intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**, along with acetaldehyde.\n\n**4. Plan the Final Reaction (Stage 2)**\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde produced in Stage 1 is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the final target product.\n\n**5.

The most effective way to solve this is to work backward from the product (retrosynthesis) to identify the necessary intermediate and then devise a forward synthesis from the starting material.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Final Product:** The target molecule is `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. The reaction involves two molecules of an aldehyde precursor. By mentally breaking the bond formed during the aldol reaction (the one between the carbon bearing the -OH group and the carbon adjacent to the -CHO group), we can identify the precursor as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Define the Overall Goal:** The synthesis must first convert the starting material, `ethynylcyclohexane`, into the key intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. Then, this intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed self-aldol reaction to form the final product.\n\n3.  **Devise the Synthetic Pathway:**\n    *   **Stage 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n        *   The starting material has an 8-carbon skeleton (C₆ ring + C₂ alkyne), while the intermediate has a 7-carbon skeleton (C₆ ring + C₁ aldehyde). This requires a reaction that cleaves a carbon-carbon bond.\n        *   Ozonolysis is the standard method for cleaving a C=C double bond to form carbonyl compounds. To get an aldehyde, a reductive workup is essential.\n        *   Therefore, the alkyne must first be converted into a suitable alkene. To get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`Cyclohexyl-CHO`), we need to cleave an alkene of the form `Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-R`. The simplest choice for R is a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n        *   **Step 1.1 (Alkylation):** The terminal alkyne (`Cyclohexyl-C≡CH`) is deprotonated with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion reacts with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`) to form an internal alkyne (`Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`).\n        *   **Step 1.2 (Partial Reduction):** The internal alkyne is reduced to an alkene. To stop the reaction at the alkene stage (and not proceed to an alkane), a \"poisoned\" catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is used. This produces a *cis*-alkene.\n        *   **Step 1.3 (Ozonolysis):** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`) followed by a **reductive workup** (using dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`). This breaks the double bond to yield the desired intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, and acetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Stage 2: Aldol Addition**\n        *   **Step 2.1 (Aldol Reaction):** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH:** This is incorrect. Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O`), which would produce carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde needed for the aldol reaction.\n    *   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH:** This is incorrect. In Step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n    *   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂:** This sequence perfectly matches the correct synthetic pathway derived above. Each step is chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n    *   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O:** This is incorrect. Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison, which would fully reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane, making the subsequent ozonolysis impossible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the sequence in option C is the only one that provides a chemically correct and logical pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key feature is the acidic proton on the terminal carbon of the alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. Specifically, it is the product formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of an intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Stage 1: Synthesis of the Intermediate.** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Stage 2: Final Reaction.** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n### 3. Devise the Pathway for Stage 1 (Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)\n\nTo convert `Cyclohexyl-C≡CH` to `Cyclohexyl-CHO`, we need to change the functional group and shorten the carbon chain by one carbon. A reliable method for this is to modify the alkyne, convert it to an alkene, and then cleave the alkene using ozonolysis.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point, the terminal alkyne must be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne proton with a strong base (like `NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with an alkyl halide (like `CH₃Cl`). This adds a methyl group.\n    *   `Cyclohexyl-C≡CH + NaNH₂ → Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺`\n    *   `Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`\n\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage and not reduce it fully to an alkane. **Lindlar's catalyst** (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is the specific reagent for this, as it selectively reduces an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   `Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃ + H₂/Pd-CaCO₃ → (Z)-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃`\n\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a **reductive workup** (e.g., with dimethyl sulfide, `(CH₃)₂S`) is essential. An oxidative workup would produce carboxylic acids, which cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n    *   `(Z)-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃ + 1. O₃; 2. (CH₃)₂S → Cyclohexyl-CHO + CH₃CHO`\n    This step successfully produces the required intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### 4. Devise the Pathway for Stage 2 (Aldol Addition)\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Reaction.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde produced in Stage 1 is treated with a base (such as `Ba(OH)₂` or `NaOH`) to catalyze the self-aldol addition, forming the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow, we compare this correct, four-step pathway with the choices provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; ...**\n    *   This is incorrect. Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, a strong hydrogenation catalyst that would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, making the subsequent steps impossible.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway derived above. Each step uses the correct reagents for the desired transformation: alkylation, partial reduction, reductive ozonolysis, and base-catalyzed aldol addition. **This is the correct answer.**\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; ...**\n    *   This is incorrect. Step 3 uses `O₃/H₂O`, which is an oxidative workup for ozonolysis. This would produce carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde needed for the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; ...**\n    *   This is incorrect. In Step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation of the alkyne.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo decide the final answer, a careful, step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation is required.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key feature is the acidic proton on the terminal carbon of the alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. As correctly identified by the candidate answers, this name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** By mentally reversing the aldol reaction, we can identify the precursor molecule. The reaction joins two molecules of the same aldehyde. Therefore, the key intermediate that must be synthesized is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **2. Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two main stages:\n1.  **Stage 1: Formation of the Intermediate.** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Stage 2: The Aldol Reaction.** Use a base to catalyze the self-addition reaction of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Correct Synthetic Pathway**\n\nTo get from ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), we need to change the functional group and shorten the carbon chain by one carbon. This can be achieved through a sequence of reactions:\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The terminal alkyne is deprotonated with a strong base, sodium amide (`NaNH₂`), to create a nucleophilic acetylide anion. This anion then reacts with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`) to add a methyl group, forming an internal alkyne (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne). This step is crucial to set up the correct cleavage point for the next steps.\n    *   `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH + NaNH₂ → C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺`\n    *   `C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`\n\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be converted to an alkene. It is critical to avoid reducing it all the way to an alkane. Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is a \"poisoned\" catalyst specifically used to stop the reduction at the alkene stage, yielding a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   `C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃ + H₂/Pd-CaCO₃ → (Z)-C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`\n\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis with Reductive Workup.** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain aldehydes as the products, a **reductive workup** with a mild reducing agent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is essential. This step breaks the alkene, yielding the desired cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    *   `(Z)-C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃ + 1. O₃; 2. (CH₃)₂S → C₆H₁₁-CHO + CH₃CHO`\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), which catalyzes the aldol addition reaction to form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### **4.

O₃/ H₂O; ...:** This is incorrect. Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O`), which would produce carboxylic acids instead of the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis, the sequence in option A is the only one that is chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must devise a logical synthetic plan that transforms the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the final product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and Final Product\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane.

A reliable method for this is ozonolysis of a carefully chosen alkene.\n\n1.  **Alkylation:** First, the terminal alkyne is converted to an internal alkyne. The acidic proton is removed by a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`). The resulting acetylide anion then reacts with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`), to add a methyl group. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne is then reduced to an alkene. To avoid over-reduction to an alkane, a \"poisoned\" catalyst is essential.

The proton on the terminal carbon of the alkyne is acidic.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This functional group arrangement is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** By mentally reversing the aldol reaction, we can identify the precursor molecule. The reaction involves the formation of a new bond between the α-carbon of one aldehyde and the carbonyl carbon of another. Breaking this bond reveals that the required intermediate for the final step is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.
