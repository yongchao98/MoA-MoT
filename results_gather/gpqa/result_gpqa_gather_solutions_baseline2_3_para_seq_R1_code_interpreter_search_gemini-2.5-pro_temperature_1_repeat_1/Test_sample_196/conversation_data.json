This involves analyzing both the IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This extremely broad signal is a definitive characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH) dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions indicate C=C stretching vibrations, confirming the presence of an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data unambiguously identifies Compound X as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, located very far downfield, is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pair of doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their downfield shift. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the second substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals define the structure of the second substituent. We must assemble them logically:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) adjacent to a methylene group (`-CH₂-`).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) adjacent to a methine group (`-CH-`).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is the methine (`-CH-`) proton. Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (it is a benzylic proton).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` corresponds to the methylene (`-CH₂-`) group.\n        *   By connecting these pieces, we find the benzylic carbon is a methine (`-CH-`) which is attached to both a methyl group (`-CH₃`) and an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). This complete group is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, known as a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a classic and extremely powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for its ability to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid functional group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   **-COOH  →  -CH₃**\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The starting molecule, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options\n\nFinally, we compare the deduced structure of the final product with the multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Options:**\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n\nThe structure of our deduced final product, **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, matches perfectly with **option A**. Option B is the starting material, and option C has the incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl). Option D is an entirely different structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)\n\nThe structure of Compound X is determined by analyzing its infrared (IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad peak)**: This extremely broad absorption is a definitive characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong, sharp peak)**: This corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: These peaks indicate C=C bond stretching within an aromatic (benzene) ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR**: The data conclusively shows that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: This broad singlet, located very far downfield, is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is for the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis**: The remaining signals define the structure of the second substituent. We can piece it together by analyzing the chemical shifts and splitting patterns:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: This multiplet for one proton is downfield, consistent with a benzylic proton (the one attached to the ring). This must be the methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: This multiplet for two protons is the methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group**: The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-) which is attached to a methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet) and an ethyl group (from the 1.7 ppm methylene and 0.9 ppm triplet). Therefore, the full alkyl group is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X**: The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product\n\n1.  **Reagents**: Compound X is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n2.  **Reaction Type**: This combination of reagents is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not react.\n3.  **Transformation**: The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a methyl group.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n### Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Given Options\n\nLet's compare the predicted final product with the options provided:\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This matches the structure of our deduced final product.\n*   **B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This has an incorrect structure.\n*   **C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This contains an incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl). The starting alkyl group is retained in the reaction.\n*   **D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first task is to accurately identify Compound X from its infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a very characteristic, broad signal representing the O-H stretching of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH) dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group, consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks confirm the presence of carbon-carbon double bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a definitive signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm signal indicates these protons are adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals describe the other substituent on the ring.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂- group (part of an ethyl fragment).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH- group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is the benzylic proton (-CH-) attached to the ring, explaining its relative downfield shift.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` corresponds to the -CH₂- group of the ethyl fragment.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** By connecting these fragments, we see the benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-) group, which is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms the structure -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

This validates the IR conclusion.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is further downfield because its protons are adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group. The other substituent must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Structure**: The remaining signals define the alkyl group's structure: `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`.\n        *   The signal at `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   The signal at `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH- group.\n        *   The signal at `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is the -CH- (methine) proton. Its downfield shift indicates it's attached directly to the aromatic ring (a benzylic position).\n        *   The signal at `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` is the -CH₂- (methylene) group.\n        *   Assembling these pieces: The benzylic carbon is the methine (-CH-), which is attached to both a methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (the -CH₂- at 1.7 ppm and -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm). The full group is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Compound X**: Combining all the evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. It is important to note that this is option B, but it is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the Final Product of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n2.  **Reagent Function**: This combination of reagents is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. Its known function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the existing sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and do not react.\n3.  **Transformation**: The -COOH group on the 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid molecule is reduced to a -CH₃ group. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n4.  **Final Product**: The resulting product is a benzene ring substituted with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. The name of this molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Matching the Product with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This matches the deduced final product.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material, not the product.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure is inconsistent with the data and reaction.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer. The NMR data clearly indicate a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group, and no rearrangement occurs.\n\nThe chemical reasoning consistently and unambiguously leads to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, the solution is determined through a two-step process: identifying the starting material from the given spectra and then predicting the outcome of the specified chemical reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of Compound X is elucidated by carefully interpreting the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n**Key Points from IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is the definitive O-H stretching vibration for a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong C=O stretching absorption is characteristic of a carboxylic acid, with its frequency suggesting conjugation to an aromatic ring.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks confirm the presence of an aromatic ring (C=C stretching).\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum points unambiguously to an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**Key Points from ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield broad singlet confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinct pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n*   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals are assembled to identify the second substituent:\n    *   The signals at `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` and `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` describe an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   The signal at `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` indicates a methyl group attached to a CH group.\n    *   The signal at `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is the CH group, which is attached to the ring (benzylic position), a methyl group, and an ethyl group.\n    *   **Assembled group:** `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining these findings, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This is an intermediate conclusion; this compound is the reactant, not the final product. It matches option (B).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Final Product of the Reaction**\n\nThe second part of the question asks for the final product after reacting Compound X with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n**Key Points of the Reaction:**\n*   **Reagents:** Red Phosphorus (Red P) and Hydroiodic Acid (HI).\n*   **Transformation:** This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n*   **Selectivity:** The reaction is highly effective for carbonyl and carboxyl groups but will not affect the aromatic ring or the existing saturated alkyl chain (the sec-butyl group). The sec-butyl group does not rearrange.\n*   **Final Product:** The `-COOH` group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a `-CH₃` group. The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe must match the predicted final product, **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, with the original options:\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect.

Its position is typical for a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are indicative of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data strongly indicates that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet (bs) located far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet (d) representing two protons, are the hallmark pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is for the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is for the protons adjacent to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):** These signals describe the other substituent on the ring. We can assemble its structure by analyzing the integration and splitting patterns:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H. Its downfield shift suggests it is attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton). This must be the methine (-CH-) proton.\n    *   **Assembling the group:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-), which is attached to both a methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm signal) and an ethyl group (from the 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm signals). The full structure of the alkyl group is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Predict the Final Product\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound X is treated with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. Its function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the existing saturated sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options\n\nFinally, we compare our predicted product with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This structure is inconsistent with the starting material and reaction.\n*   D) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This name perfectly matches the structure of the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers, a unanimous and correct line of reasoning emerges. The discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from inconsistencies in the option lists presented to each agent, not from errors in chemical analysis. The step-by-step consensus is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**:\n    *   The very broad peak at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive indicator of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that forms hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O carbonyl stretch in a carboxylic acid, and its position suggests conjugation with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of C=C double bonds within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR**: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is the classic signal for the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), confirming the IR data.\n    *   The two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield position of the 8.0 ppm signal is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the second substituent on the ring. Piecing them together based on their chemical shift, integration, and splitting pattern:\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A benzylic methine proton (-CH-) attached to the ring.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the methine carbon.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A methyl group (-CH₃) at the end of an ethyl fragment.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group**: The benzylic -CH- proton is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This creates a **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃** group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n*   **Conclusion on Compound X**: The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. In the provided options, this is option D, but it is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Identify the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents**: The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and HI**.\n*   **Reaction Type**: This reagent combination is a powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group, being saturated, are unaffected.\n*   **Transformation**: The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a methyl group.\n*   **Final Product**: The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nComparing the deduced final product, **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, with the original list of options:\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This exactly matches the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect structure.\n*   **C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect alkyl isomer. The NMR data clearly indicate a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n*   **D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material, not the product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of the reactant is identified by a careful analysis of the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that forms hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.

This is a very strong piece of evidence for a -COOH group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp absorption corresponding to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These are characteristic C=C bond stretches, confirming the presence of an aromatic (benzene) ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, located very far downfield, is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**), which perfectly confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet representing two protons, are a definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.

We can piece together its structure:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H signifies a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment starter.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H signifies a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1H.
