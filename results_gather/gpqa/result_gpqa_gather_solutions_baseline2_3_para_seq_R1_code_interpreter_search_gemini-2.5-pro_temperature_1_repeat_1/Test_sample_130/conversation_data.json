This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product).

Identification of the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction will form a bicyclic adduct, and the given molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that this is the only transformation.\n\n**2. The Critical Point: Determining the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\nThis is the most crucial step for solving the problem correctly.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can yield two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This general rule states that, under kinetic control, the *endo* product is usually favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and dienophile.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, this rule is frequently overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons in the product) create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially proceed through the less-hindered *exo* transition state to avoid this steric repulsion. This is a well-established exception to the endo rule. Therefore, for this specific reaction:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**3. Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n*   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   We must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *exo* adduct (major product) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor product).\n\n**4. Visualizing the Structures and Proton Proximities**\nFirst, let's assign the key proton signals based on the provided options and general chemical shifts:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\nNow, let's examine the 3D structures:\n*   **In the *Exo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected. In this structure, the H_anhydride protons are distant from the Me_vinyl protons.\n*   **In the *Endo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would appear).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons with the **H_bridge** protons.\n*   The signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This combination exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to synthesize the provided answers and determine the correct choice.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reactants and Reaction\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reactants and the reaction type.\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with one ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm is unambiguously **maleic anhydride**. Its high symmetry and characteristic chemical shifts confirm this identity.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical decision point and the primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** A majority of the agents (e.g., 8, 14, 15) correctly state the general \"Alder endo rule,\" which predicts that the *endo* product is usually the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. However, a significant number of agents (e.g., 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identify that this is a textbook exception to the rule.\n*   **Correct Assessment:** The diene is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach. The *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and is therefore kinetically favored. The more rigorous chemical reasoning concludes:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the NOESY Spectra\nWe must identify a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but **absent in the minor (*endo*) product**.\n\n*   **Assignment of NMR Signals:** Based on the options provided and standard chemical shifts:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximities in Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons point \"up\" towards the C7-bridge, bringing them into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons. A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. In this geometry, they are instead close to the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe distinguishing NOESY cross-peak, which is present in the major (*exo*) isomer and absent in the minor (*endo*) isomer, connects the **anhydride protons** with the **C7-bridge protons**.\n\n*   The signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This description matches Option C.\n\nLet's re-verify the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Bridgehead methyls & vinylic methyls)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Vinylic methyls & anhydride protons). This is characteristic of the *minor* product.\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Bridge proton & anhydride protons). This is characteristic of the *major* product.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridgehead methyl & bridge proton)\n\nThe reasoning points unequivocally to Option C. Many of the agent answers correctly identified the key chemical principles (Exo major, bridge-anhydride NOE) but made errors in matching this reasoning to the final lettered option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, paying close attention to stereochemistry and the interpretation of NMR data, especially a 2D NOESY spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The provided NMR data (`¹H`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137 ppm, 165 ppm) are the classic spectroscopic signature of **maleic anhydride**. Its high symmetry accounts for the single ¹H peak (two equivalent vinyl protons) and two ¹³C peaks (two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic product. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the addition of the reactants (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃).\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical point of analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle that predicts the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Many of the provided agents rely on this rule.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, has bulky methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. During the transition state leading to the *endo* product, these methyl groups would severely clash with the approaching anhydride ring.\n    *   To avoid this significant steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic and well-documented exception to the endo rule.\n    *   Therefore, the correct stereochemical assignment is:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n3.  **Assign ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry. Based on chemical environment and the integrals provided in the options, we can assign the signals:\n        *   **`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`**: These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to being adjacent to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   **`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`**: This represents one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **`6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`**: These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **`6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm`**: These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n    *   We must therefore identify a pair of protons that are close in the **exo** adduct (Major) but far apart in the **endo** adduct (Minor).\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are located in the \"cup\" of the bicyclic system, pointing towards the C7-bridge. This brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the C7-bridge (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. (Instead, they become close to the **Me_vinyl** protons at ~1.7 ppm, which would give rise to the NOE signal characteristic of the minor product).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one connecting the **H_anhydride** protons and an **H_bridge** proton.\n    *   This corresponds to the interaction between the **`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`** and the **`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`**.\n    *   This pair of resonances matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and evaluating the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n\nThere is unanimous agreement among all candidate answers on this point, and it is chemically straightforward.\n*   **Dienophile:** The description of an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks (137, 165 ppm) unambiguously identifies it as **maleic anhydride**. Its high symmetry accounts for the simple NMR spectra.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The given molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, matches the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\n\nThis is the most critical step of the problem and the main point of divergence among the candidate answers.\n*   **The General \"Endo Rule\":** Many candidate answers (e.g., 8, 14, 15) apply the standard Alder-endo rule, which states that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product. This would mean: Major Product = *Endo* Adduct.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** A significant number of the more sophisticated answers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identify a crucial exception. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach. This steric repulsion raises the energy of the *endo* transition state, making the less-hindered *exo* pathway faster.\n*   **Conclusion:** In this specific, well-known case, steric effects override the electronic preference. Therefore, the actual stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    This is the chemically correct assessment and forms the basis for the rest of the analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Assign NMR Signals and Analyze Spatial Proximities for NOESY\n\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor. We must therefore find a pair of protons that are uniquely close in space in the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Proton Signal Assignments:** Based on the options and general chemical shift knowledge, the signals can be assigned as:\n    *   **`H_anhydride`:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (protons on the fused anhydride ring, deshielded by C=O groups).\n    *   **`H_bridge`:** 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one of the diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge).\n    *   **`Me_vinyl`:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups on the C=C double bond).\n    *   **`Me_bridgehead`:** 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm (methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons).\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry places the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) in the \"cup\" of the bicyclic system, pointing them towards the C7-bridge. This results in a **close spatial proximity between `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `H_bridge` (~1.5 ppm)**. A strong NOE is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the double bond, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-bridge. The `H_anhydride` protons are now on the *exo* face, far away from the `H_bridge` protons. The NOE between these two would be absent. (Instead, a new NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` would appear in this minor product).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion and Answer Selection\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) with a C7-bridge proton (`H_bridge`).\n*   This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   Comparing this finding with the provided list of options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nOption B is a perfect match for the identified cross-peak in the major product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data provided (¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. All candidate analyses correctly identify this reactant.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. All candidate analyses correctly identify this reactant.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the direct sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃), confirming a straightforward cycloaddition.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n\nThis is the most critical and decisive step of the problem.\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The general principle, known as the **Alder-endo rule**, predicts that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically favored product. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Many candidate answers incorrectly rely solely on this general rule.\n*   However, there is a well-known **exception to the endo rule** when significant steric hindrance is present. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely sterically hindered by the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons in the product) create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n*   To avoid this strong steric repulsion, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered *exo* transition state.\n*   Therefore, the correct stereochemical outcome for this specific reaction is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    A number of the candidate analyses (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identified this critical exception.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A **NOESY** spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connections.\n*   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.**\n*   We must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the **exo** isomer (major) but far apart in the **endo** isomer (minor).\n\n### **Step 4: Assign Proton Resonances and Identify the Key Spatial Proximity**\n\nFirst, let's assign the signals given in the options based on their typical chemical shifts, integrations, and multiplicities in the bicyclic product:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n\nNow, let's analyze the 3D structures:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite* side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. In this fixed, rigid geometry, the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**) are oriented into the \"cup\" of the bicyclic system, which brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**). **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between H_anhydride and H_bridge.**\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same* side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge, tucked \"under\" the C=C bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are very far from the **H_bridge** protons. (In this isomer, an NOE would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**).\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.\n*   The signal for the anhydride protons is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The signal for the bridge proton is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis pair of resonances directly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a multistep organic chemistry problem that requires identifying the reactants, predicting the stereochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction, and interpreting the resulting 2D NOESY NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is described as an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. These features perfectly match **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The reaction yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃, consistent with the problem statement.\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical step of the problem. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The General Endo Rule:** In many Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (faster forming) major product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and dienophile.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, this general rule is overridden when there is significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely sterically hindered. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook example of a reaction where steric hindrance reverses the usual stereochemical outcome.\n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n3.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product.**\n    *   Based on our stereochemical analysis, we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the ***exo*** isomer but far apart in the ***endo*** isomer.\n\n4.  **Assign Proton Signals and Analyze 3D Structures:**\n    *   First, we assign the proton signals from the options based on chemical shifts and integrations. The product molecule possesses a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n    *   Next, we examine the spatial relationships:\n        *   **In the *Exo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons point \"upwards\" and towards the C7 bridge. This brings the **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n        *   **In the *Endo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons. (In this isomer, the **H_anhydride** protons are close to the **Me_vinyl** protons, which would give rise to a different NOESY cross-peak).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) is the one connecting the **anhydride protons** and a **C7-methylene bridge proton**.\n    *   This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This pair of resonances is described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of the most chemically sound arguments.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reactants and the reaction type.\n*   **Dienophile:** The spectroscopic data (`¹H`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137 ppm, 165 ppm) and the description (\"dehydrated from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid\") unambiguously point to **maleic anhydride**. Its symmetry explains the simple spectra.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms it is a direct addition with no subsequent transformations.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\nThis is the most critical step and the primary source of divergence among the candidate answers.\n*   **The General \"Endo Rule\":** This rule of thumb predicts that the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored and therefore major product in most Diels-Alder reactions. Several candidate answers (e.g., 8, 14, 15) follow this rule without considering exceptions.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** This rule is frequently overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The two methyl groups at the termini of the diene system (C1 and C4) create a severe steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* transition state. The *exo* approach avoids this clash. Consequently, the transition state for the *exo* product is lower in energy, making the **exo adduct the major kinetic product**. A significant number of the more sophisticated analyses (e.g., 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identify this exception.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemically sound conclusion is that the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the NOESY NMR Spectrum\n*   A **NOESY** spectrum reveals which protons are close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem asks to identify the resonances for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assign Proton Signals and Visualize the Structures\nThe signals described in the options can be assigned as follows:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\nNow, we compare the key spatial relationships:\n*   **In the *Exo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* of the C=C bond bridge. This orientation forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) towards the C7-methylene bridge, bringing them very close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the C=C bond bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they become close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). The NOESY peak between **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge** would be absent or weak.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Answer\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons and an **H_bridge** proton. The resonances for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis pair matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and evaluating the reasoning from the provided candidate agents.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reactants and the reaction type.\n*   **Dienophile:** The anhydride with a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm is unambiguously **maleic anhydride**. Its symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a simple addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis and the primary point of disagreement among the agents.\n*   **The General Rule (Alder-Endo Rule):** Many agents (e.g., 8, 14, 15) apply the standard endo rule, which predicts that the *endo* isomer is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. This leads them to assume the major product is the *endo* adduct.\n*   **The Exception (Steric Hindrance):** A more advanced and chemically accurate analysis, correctly identified by a majority of the agents' reasoning sections (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13), notes that the diene is exceptionally bulky. The two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach. This steric repulsion is strong enough to override the electronic preference for the endo transition state.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. Therefore, for this specific reaction, the normal outcome is reversed:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the NOESY Spectra\nThe question asks to identify a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent (or weak) in the minor product. Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Proton Signal Assignment and Structural Analysis\nThere is a general consensus on assigning the signals from the options to the protons in the symmetrical product:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule. Let's call these **H_fused**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups on the product's double bond. Let's call these **Me_vinyl**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge at the C7 position. Let's call this **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\nNow, we must visualize the key spatial proximities in the two isomers:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_fused** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the concave face (\"endo pocket\") of the molecule, bringing them into very close proximity with the C7-bridge proton that is also pointing into that pocket (**H_bridge** at ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge, tucked under the vinylic methyls. In this arrangement, the **H_fused** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. (A cross-peak between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would be expected here instead).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_fused)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This is the characteristic peak for the *minor* product)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This perfectly matches our conclusion for the *major* product)\n\nMany of the candidate answers have flawed final outputs, despite having correct intermediate reasoning. The most chemically sound reasoning path leads directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is described as an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with one ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. These characteristics—high symmetry, vinylic protons deshielded by carbonyls, vinylic carbon signal, and carbonyl carbon signal—unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical point of the problem. A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle stating that the *endo* isomer is typically the major product due to kinetic favorability from secondary orbital interactions. Several of the provided candidate answers rely on this general rule.\n    *   However, this rule is frequently overridden by significant **steric hindrance**. The diene used here is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons in the product) create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring as it approaches in the *endo* orientation.\n    *   To avoid this steric repulsion, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a classic textbook exception to the endo rule.\n    *   Therefore, the correct stereochemical assignment is:\n        *   **Major Product = Exo Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = Endo Adduct**\n\n3.  **Assign Proton NMR Signals and Analyze NOESY Data:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n    *   First, we assign the proton signals based on the options and typical chemical shifts for the symmetrical product:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule. Let's call these `H_anhydride`.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. Let's call these `Me_vinyl`.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Let's call this `H_bridge`.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n4.  **Identify the Distinguishing Spatial Interaction:**\n    *   We must find a proton-proton proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer (major product)**.\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C bond and toward the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C bond. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far away from the `H_bridge` protons. In this orientation, they are instead close to the `Me_vinyl` protons (~1.7 ppm), which would produce a different characteristic NOE.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) is the one connecting the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) and a C7-bridge proton (`H_bridge`).\n    *   This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This pair of resonances is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and chemical principles.\n\n### 1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The description of an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks (137, 165 ppm) unambiguously identifies this reactant as **maleic anhydride**. Its symmetry is responsible for the simple NMR spectra.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a simple addition of the two reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### 2. Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical step of the problem.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General Endo Rule:** Typically, the *endo* adduct is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Several of the candidate answers rely on this general rule.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** This general rule is frequently overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is highly substituted. During the *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride ring would severely clash with the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The *exo* approach avoids this clash.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to this severe steric hindrance, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the lower-energy *exo* transition state. This is a well-established exception to the endo rule. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### 3. Analyze the NOESY Spectra\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks for protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n*   The question states that a key cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   We must find a spatial proximity that exists in the *exo* isomer (major) but not in the *endo* isomer (minor).\n\n### 4. Assign NMR Signals and Analyze Structures\n*   Let's assign the signals given in the options to the protons in the product:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (`H_anhydride`). They are heavily deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This represents one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   Now let's visualize the key spatial relationships:\n    *   **Major Product (*Exo* Isomer):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C double bond and towards the C7-bridge. This geometry brings the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two resonances is expected.\n    *   **Minor Product (*Endo* Isomer):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far from the `H_bridge` protons but are instead close to the `Me_vinyl` protons (~1.7 ppm). The cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `H_bridge` would be absent.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) with a bridge proton (`H_bridge`). This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm  (This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* endo product)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm  (**This interaction is characteristic of the *major* exo product**)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### 1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reactants and the reaction:\n*   **Dienophile:** The spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137, 165 ppm) for the anhydride of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a simple addition of the reactants (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄).\n\n### 2. Determine the Major Product (Stereochemistry) - The Crucial Step\nThis is the main point of divergence in the candidate answers and the key to solving the problem correctly.\n*   **The \"Endo Rule\":** This is a general principle stating that the *endo* stereoisomer is the kinetically favored and therefore the major product. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene's π-system and the dienophile's substituents. A significant number of agents (e.g., 8, 9, 14, 15) base their reasoning on this general rule.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** The *endo rule* is a guideline, not an absolute law, and it is frequently overridden by strong steric repulsion. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is highly substituted and bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring must approach \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash and has a lower energy transition state. This makes the **exo adduct the major kinetic product**. A majority of the provided analyses (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identify this exception. This is the more rigorous and chemically accurate reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The major product is the *exo* adduct, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### 3. Assign NMR Signals and Analyze the NOESY Spectrum\nWe are looking for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n*   **Signal Assignments:** Based on standard chemical shifts, the signals in the options are assigned as follows:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the product (`H_anhydride`). They are strongly deshielded by the neighboring carbonyl groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   **Major (*Exo*) Isomer:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. This brings the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected. The `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `Me_vinyl` protons.\n    *   **Minor (*Endo*) Isomer:** Here, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C bond. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far from the `H_bridge` protons but are very close to the `Me_vinyl` protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:** The cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one is the interaction between `H_anhydride` and `H_bridge`.\n\n### 4. Select the Final Answer\nThe key interaction connects the `H_anhydride` protons with one of the `H_bridge` protons.\n*   `H_anhydride` signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   `H_bridge` signal: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis pair of resonances is described in option B.\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This cross-peak is characteristic of the minor (*endo*) product.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This cross-peak is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Not a distinguishing interaction.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Not a distinguishing interaction.\n\nThe correct reasoning path leads to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving identifying reactants from spectroscopic data, determining the stereochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction, and interpreting a 2D NOESY NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data provided (`¹H`: a single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137 ppm, 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Its plane of symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (one ¹H peak) and the two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent, respectively (two ¹³C peaks).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct cycloaddition has occurred.\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical step of the problem. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle that predicts the *endo* product as the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule is frequently overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. In this specific case, the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) has bulky methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the anhydride ring would tuck underneath the diene system, causing a severe steric clash with these methyl groups.\n    *   To avoid this clash, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the reaction's outcome, reversing the usual preference.\n    *   Therefore, the correct stereochemical outcome is:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n3.  **Assign Proton NMR Signals:**\n    *   Based on general chemical shifts, integrations, and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). They are heavily deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum based on 3D Structures:**\n    *   A **NOESY** spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n    *   We must find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*exo*) structure but far apart in the minor (*endo*) structure.\n    *   **In the Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (away from) the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are forced into the interior \"cup\" of the bicyclic system. This brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the C7-bridge (**H_bridge** at ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n    *   **In the Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are on the exterior face of the molecule, far away from the **H_bridge** protons. No significant NOESY cross-peak is expected between them. (Instead, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would be present in this minor isomer).\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the problem's description. The cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor is the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n5.  **Match the Conclusion to the Options:**\n    *   The interacting protons are **H_anhydride** (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and **H_bridge** (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n    *   This corresponds to the option describing a cross-peak between **\"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"**. This is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and reaching a final conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride has highly symmetrical NMR spectra: one ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. These characteristics, particularly the symmetry and chemical shifts (vinylic and carbonyl regions), are the classic signature of **maleic anhydride**. This conclusion is universally and correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition. The molecular formula of the products, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, matches the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition reaction.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical and decisive step of the analysis, where there is a major split in the reasoning of the candidate answers.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General \"Endo Rule\":** Under kinetic control, the *endo* product is typically favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups. Several candidate answers (e.g., 1, 8, 9, 14, 15) apply this general rule to conclude that the *endo* adduct is the major product.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** The endo rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this specific case, the diene is extremely bulky, with four methyl groups on its pi system. The methyl groups at the termini (C1 and C4) create a severe steric clash with the approaching anhydride ring in the transition state leading to the *endo* product. The *exo* approach avoids this clash, making its transition state lower in energy. This is a well-established exception to the endo rule.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The more sophisticated and chemically accurate reasoning, which is supported by a majority of the provided answers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13), correctly identifies that steric effects dominate. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of NMR Signals and NOESY Data\nWe are looking for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*)** but absent or weak in the minor product (*endo*).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signal Assignments:** Based on the integrations and typical chemical shifts provided in the options, we can assign the key proton signals:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7-methylene bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this isomer, a strong NOE between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would appear instead).\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a bridge proton. The resonances for these two groups are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This pair of signals directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The description of an anhydride derived from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with highly symmetrical NMR data (`¹H`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137, 165 ppm) unambiguously identifies the molecule as **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a simple cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical decision in the problem. The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle stating that the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. Several candidate answers rely on this general rule.\n    *   However, the endo rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the sterically less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    *   The chemically most accurate reasoning requires acknowledging this steric effect.\n\n3.  **Assign Proton NMR Signals:**\n    *   The problem describes four distinct proton environments in the product. Based on typical chemical shifts, integrals, and multiplicities, we can confidently assign them:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This represents one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum to Identify the Major Product:**\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**.\n    *   Since the major product is the **exo** adduct, we must find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *exo* structure.\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the bicyclic system from the C=C double bond bridge. This geometry points the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) towards the C7 methylene bridge, bringing them very close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C=C double bond bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak. (In this minor product, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would be expected instead).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak that is present only in the major (*exo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons and an **H_bridge** proton.\n    *   The corresponding signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This pair of resonances matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, focusing on stereochemistry and its spectroscopic consequences.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reaction Identification**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The first reactant is an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its spectroscopic data (a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This information unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry: Determining the Major Product**\n    *   This is the most critical step in solving the problem. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   The general \"Alder-Endo Rule\" predicts that the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored (and thus major) product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Many of the candidate answers rely on this general rule.\n    *   However, there is a crucial **exception** to this rule when significant steric hindrance is present. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. During the *endo* approach, the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions would sterically clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring.\n    *   To avoid this severe steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This makes the **exo adduct the major product** and the *endo* adduct the minor product. This is a classic textbook example of steric effects overriding electronic preferences.\n\n3.  **Proton Signal Assignment**\n    *   The problem provides several key signals from the product's ¹H NMR spectrum. Based on their chemical shift, integration, and multiplicity, we can assign them to specific protons in the bicyclic product (which possesses a plane of symmetry):\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are physically close to each other in 3D space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent in the minor one**. Since we determined the **Major product = *Exo*** and the **Minor product = *Endo***, we must find a spatial proximity unique to the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **In the *Exo* (Major) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7 methylene bridge. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the *Endo* (Minor) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked underneath the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, so the cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would appear).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a methylene bridge proton.\n    *   These signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   Looking at the choices provided, this pair matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Identification of the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction will form a bicyclic adduct, and the given molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that this is the only transformation.\n\n**2. The Critical Point: Determining the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\nThis is the most crucial step for solving the problem correctly.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can yield two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This general rule states that, under kinetic control, the *endo* product is usually favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and dienophile.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, this rule is frequently overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons in the product) create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially proceed through the less-hindered *exo* transition state to avoid this steric repulsion. This is a well-established exception to the endo rule. Therefore, for this specific reaction:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n**3. Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n*   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   We must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *exo* adduct (major product) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor product).\n\n**4. Visualizing the Structures and Proton Proximities**\nFirst, let's assign the key proton signals based on the provided options and general chemical shifts:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\nNow, let's examine the 3D structures:\n*   **In the *Exo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected. In this structure, the H_anhydride protons are distant from the Me_vinyl protons.\n*   **In the *Endo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would appear).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons with the **H_bridge** protons.\n*   The signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This combination exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to synthesize the provided answers and determine the correct choice.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reactants and Reaction\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reactants and the reaction type.\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with one ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm is unambiguously **maleic anhydride**. Its high symmetry and characteristic chemical shifts confirm this identity.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical decision point and the primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** A majority of the agents (e.g., 8, 14, 15) correctly state the general \"Alder endo rule,\" which predicts that the *endo* product is usually the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. However, a significant number of agents (e.g., 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identify that this is a textbook exception to the rule.\n*   **Correct Assessment:** The diene is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach. The *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and is therefore kinetically favored. The more rigorous chemical reasoning concludes:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the NOESY Spectra\nWe must identify a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but **absent in the minor (*endo*) product**.\n\n*   **Assignment of NMR Signals:** Based on the options provided and standard chemical shifts:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximities in Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons point \"up\" towards the C7-bridge, bringing them into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons. A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. In this geometry, they are instead close to the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe distinguishing NOESY cross-peak, which is present in the major (*exo*) isomer and absent in the minor (*endo*) isomer, connects the **anhydride protons** with the **C7-bridge protons**.\n\n*   The signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This description matches Option C.\n\nLet's re-verify the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Bridgehead methyls & vinylic methyls)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Vinylic methyls & anhydride protons). This is characteristic of the *minor* product.\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Bridge proton & anhydride protons). This is characteristic of the *major* product.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridgehead methyl & bridge proton)\n\nThe reasoning points unequivocally to Option C. Many of the agent answers correctly identified the key chemical principles (Exo major, bridge-anhydride NOE) but made errors in matching this reasoning to the final lettered option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, paying close attention to stereochemistry and the interpretation of NMR data, especially a 2D NOESY spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The provided NMR data (`¹H`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137 ppm, 165 ppm) are the classic spectroscopic signature of **maleic anhydride**. Its high symmetry accounts for the single ¹H peak (two equivalent vinyl protons) and two ¹³C peaks (two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic product. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the addition of the reactants (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃).\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical point of analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle that predicts the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Many of the provided agents rely on this rule.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, has bulky methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. During the transition state leading to the *endo* product, these methyl groups would severely clash with the approaching anhydride ring.\n    *   To avoid this significant steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic and well-documented exception to the endo rule.\n    *   Therefore, the correct stereochemical assignment is:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n3.  **Assign ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry. Based on chemical environment and the integrals provided in the options, we can assign the signals:\n        *   **`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`**: These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to being adjacent to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   **`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`**: This represents one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **`6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`**: These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **`6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm`**: These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n    *   We must therefore identify a pair of protons that are close in the **exo** adduct (Major) but far apart in the **endo** adduct (Minor).\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are located in the \"cup\" of the bicyclic system, pointing towards the C7-bridge. This brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the C7-bridge (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. (Instead, they become close to the **Me_vinyl** protons at ~1.7 ppm, which would give rise to the NOE signal characteristic of the minor product).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one connecting the **H_anhydride** protons and an **H_bridge** proton.\n    *   This corresponds to the interaction between the **`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`** and the **`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`**.\n    *   This pair of resonances matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and evaluating the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n\nThere is unanimous agreement among all candidate answers on this point, and it is chemically straightforward.\n*   **Dienophile:** The description of an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks (137, 165 ppm) unambiguously identifies it as **maleic anhydride**. Its high symmetry accounts for the simple NMR spectra.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The given molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, matches the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\n\nThis is the most critical step of the problem and the main point of divergence among the candidate answers.\n*   **The General \"Endo Rule\":** Many candidate answers (e.g., 8, 14, 15) apply the standard Alder-endo rule, which states that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product. This would mean: Major Product = *Endo* Adduct.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** A significant number of the more sophisticated answers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identify a crucial exception. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach. This steric repulsion raises the energy of the *endo* transition state, making the less-hindered *exo* pathway faster.\n*   **Conclusion:** In this specific, well-known case, steric effects override the electronic preference. Therefore, the actual stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    This is the chemically correct assessment and forms the basis for the rest of the analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Assign NMR Signals and Analyze Spatial Proximities for NOESY\n\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor. We must therefore find a pair of protons that are uniquely close in space in the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Proton Signal Assignments:** Based on the options and general chemical shift knowledge, the signals can be assigned as:\n    *   **`H_anhydride`:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (protons on the fused anhydride ring, deshielded by C=O groups).\n    *   **`H_bridge`:** 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one of the diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge).\n    *   **`Me_vinyl`:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups on the C=C double bond).\n    *   **`Me_bridgehead`:** 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm (methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons).\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry places the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) in the \"cup\" of the bicyclic system, pointing them towards the C7-bridge. This results in a **close spatial proximity between `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `H_bridge` (~1.5 ppm)**. A strong NOE is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the double bond, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-bridge. The `H_anhydride` protons are now on the *exo* face, far away from the `H_bridge` protons. The NOE between these two would be absent. (Instead, a new NOE between `H_anhydride` and `Me_vinyl` would appear in this minor product).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion and Answer Selection\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) with a C7-bridge proton (`H_bridge`).\n*   This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   Comparing this finding with the provided list of options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nOption B is a perfect match for the identified cross-peak in the major product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data provided (¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. All candidate analyses correctly identify this reactant.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. All candidate analyses correctly identify this reactant.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the direct sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃), confirming a straightforward cycloaddition.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n\nThis is the most critical and decisive step of the problem.\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The general principle, known as the **Alder-endo rule**, predicts that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically favored product. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Many candidate answers incorrectly rely solely on this general rule.\n*   However, there is a well-known **exception to the endo rule** when significant steric hindrance is present. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely sterically hindered by the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons in the product) create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n*   To avoid this strong steric repulsion, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered *exo* transition state.\n*   Therefore, the correct stereochemical outcome for this specific reaction is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    A number of the candidate analyses (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identified this critical exception.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A **NOESY** spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connections.\n*   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.**\n*   We must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the **exo** isomer (major) but far apart in the **endo** isomer (minor).\n\n### **Step 4: Assign Proton Resonances and Identify the Key Spatial Proximity**\n\nFirst, let's assign the signals given in the options based on their typical chemical shifts, integrations, and multiplicities in the bicyclic product:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n\nNow, let's analyze the 3D structures:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite* side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. In this fixed, rigid geometry, the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**) are oriented into the \"cup\" of the bicyclic system, which brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**). **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between H_anhydride and H_bridge.**\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same* side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge, tucked \"under\" the C=C bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are very far from the **H_bridge** protons. (In this isomer, an NOE would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**).\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.\n*   The signal for the anhydride protons is the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The signal for the bridge proton is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis pair of resonances directly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a multistep organic chemistry problem that requires identifying the reactants, predicting the stereochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction, and interpreting the resulting 2D NOESY NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is described as an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. These features perfectly match **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The reaction yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃, consistent with the problem statement.\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical step of the problem. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The General Endo Rule:** In many Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (faster forming) major product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and dienophile.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance Exception:** However, this general rule is overridden when there is significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely sterically hindered. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook example of a reaction where steric hindrance reverses the usual stereochemical outcome.\n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n3.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product.**\n    *   Based on our stereochemical analysis, we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the ***exo*** isomer but far apart in the ***endo*** isomer.\n\n4.  **Assign Proton Signals and Analyze 3D Structures:**\n    *   First, we assign the proton signals from the options based on chemical shifts and integrations. The product molecule possesses a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n    *   Next, we examine the spatial relationships:\n        *   **In the *Exo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons point \"upwards\" and towards the C7 bridge. This brings the **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n        *   **In the *Endo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons. (In this isomer, the **H_anhydride** protons are close to the **Me_vinyl** protons, which would give rise to a different NOESY cross-peak).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) is the one connecting the **anhydride protons** and a **C7-methylene bridge proton**.\n    *   This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This pair of resonances is described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of the most chemically sound arguments.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reactants and the reaction type.\n*   **Dienophile:** The spectroscopic data (`¹H`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137 ppm, 165 ppm) and the description (\"dehydrated from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid\") unambiguously point to **maleic anhydride**. Its symmetry explains the simple spectra.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms it is a direct addition with no subsequent transformations.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\nThis is the most critical step and the primary source of divergence among the candidate answers.\n*   **The General \"Endo Rule\":** This rule of thumb predicts that the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored and therefore major product in most Diels-Alder reactions. Several candidate answers (e.g., 8, 14, 15) follow this rule without considering exceptions.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** This rule is frequently overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The two methyl groups at the termini of the diene system (C1 and C4) create a severe steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* transition state. The *exo* approach avoids this clash. Consequently, the transition state for the *exo* product is lower in energy, making the **exo adduct the major kinetic product**. A significant number of the more sophisticated analyses (e.g., 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identify this exception.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemically sound conclusion is that the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the NOESY NMR Spectrum\n*   A **NOESY** spectrum reveals which protons are close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem asks to identify the resonances for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assign Proton Signals and Visualize the Structures\nThe signals described in the options can be assigned as follows:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\nNow, we compare the key spatial relationships:\n*   **In the *Exo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* of the C=C bond bridge. This orientation forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) towards the C7-methylene bridge, bringing them very close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the C=C bond bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they become close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). The NOESY peak between **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge** would be absent or weak.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Answer\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons and an **H_bridge** proton. The resonances for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThis pair matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and evaluating the reasoning from the provided candidate agents.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reactants and the reaction type.\n*   **Dienophile:** The anhydride with a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm is unambiguously **maleic anhydride**. Its symmetry accounts for the simple spectra, and the chemical shifts are characteristic.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between this diene and dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a simple addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis and the primary point of disagreement among the agents.\n*   **The General Rule (Alder-Endo Rule):** Many agents (e.g., 8, 14, 15) apply the standard endo rule, which predicts that the *endo* isomer is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. This leads them to assume the major product is the *endo* adduct.\n*   **The Exception (Steric Hindrance):** A more advanced and chemically accurate analysis, correctly identified by a majority of the agents' reasoning sections (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13), notes that the diene is exceptionally bulky. The two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach. This steric repulsion is strong enough to override the electronic preference for the endo transition state.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. Therefore, for this specific reaction, the normal outcome is reversed:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the NOESY Spectra\nThe question asks to identify a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent (or weak) in the minor product. Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Proton Signal Assignment and Structural Analysis\nThere is a general consensus on assigning the signals from the options to the protons in the symmetrical product:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule. Let's call these **H_fused**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups on the product's double bond. Let's call these **Me_vinyl**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge at the C7 position. Let's call this **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\nNow, we must visualize the key spatial proximities in the two isomers:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_fused** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the concave face (\"endo pocket\") of the molecule, bringing them into very close proximity with the C7-bridge proton that is also pointing into that pocket (**H_bridge** at ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge, tucked under the vinylic methyls. In this arrangement, the **H_fused** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. (A cross-peak between **H_fused** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would be expected here instead).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_fused)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This is the characteristic peak for the *minor* product)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This perfectly matches our conclusion for the *major* product)\n\nMany of the candidate answers have flawed final outputs, despite having correct intermediate reasoning. The most chemically sound reasoning path leads directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is described as an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with one ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. These characteristics—high symmetry, vinylic protons deshielded by carbonyls, vinylic carbon signal, and carbonyl carbon signal—unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical point of the problem. A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle stating that the *endo* isomer is typically the major product due to kinetic favorability from secondary orbital interactions. Several of the provided candidate answers rely on this general rule.\n    *   However, this rule is frequently overridden by significant **steric hindrance**. The diene used here is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons in the product) create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring as it approaches in the *endo* orientation.\n    *   To avoid this steric repulsion, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a classic textbook exception to the endo rule.\n    *   Therefore, the correct stereochemical assignment is:\n        *   **Major Product = Exo Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = Endo Adduct**\n\n3.  **Assign Proton NMR Signals and Analyze NOESY Data:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n    *   First, we assign the proton signals based on the options and typical chemical shifts for the symmetrical product:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule. Let's call these `H_anhydride`.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. Let's call these `Me_vinyl`.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Let's call this `H_bridge`.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n4.  **Identify the Distinguishing Spatial Interaction:**\n    *   We must find a proton-proton proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer (major product)**.\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C bond and toward the C7-methylene bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C bond. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far away from the `H_bridge` protons. In this orientation, they are instead close to the `Me_vinyl` protons (~1.7 ppm), which would produce a different characteristic NOE.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) is the one connecting the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) and a C7-bridge proton (`H_bridge`).\n    *   This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This pair of resonances is described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and chemical principles.\n\n### 1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The description of an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks (137, 165 ppm) unambiguously identifies this reactant as **maleic anhydride**. Its symmetry is responsible for the simple NMR spectra.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a simple addition of the two reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### 2. Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical step of the problem.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General Endo Rule:** Typically, the *endo* adduct is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Several of the candidate answers rely on this general rule.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** This general rule is frequently overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is highly substituted. During the *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride ring would severely clash with the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The *exo* approach avoids this clash.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to this severe steric hindrance, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the lower-energy *exo* transition state. This is a well-established exception to the endo rule. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### 3. Analyze the NOESY Spectra\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks for protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n*   The question states that a key cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   We must find a spatial proximity that exists in the *exo* isomer (major) but not in the *endo* isomer (minor).\n\n### 4. Assign NMR Signals and Analyze Structures\n*   Let's assign the signals given in the options to the protons in the product:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (`H_anhydride`). They are heavily deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This represents one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   Now let's visualize the key spatial relationships:\n    *   **Major Product (*Exo* Isomer):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C=C double bond and towards the C7-bridge. This geometry brings the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two resonances is expected.\n    *   **Minor Product (*Endo* Isomer):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far from the `H_bridge` protons but are instead close to the `Me_vinyl` protons (~1.7 ppm). The cross-peak between `H_anhydride` and `H_bridge` would be absent.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) with a bridge proton (`H_bridge`). This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm  (This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* endo product)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm  (**This interaction is characteristic of the *major* exo product**)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n### 1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the reactants and the reaction:\n*   **Dienophile:** The spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137, 165 ppm) for the anhydride of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms a simple addition of the reactants (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄).\n\n### 2. Determine the Major Product (Stereochemistry) - The Crucial Step\nThis is the main point of divergence in the candidate answers and the key to solving the problem correctly.\n*   **The \"Endo Rule\":** This is a general principle stating that the *endo* stereoisomer is the kinetically favored and therefore the major product. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene's π-system and the dienophile's substituents. A significant number of agents (e.g., 8, 9, 14, 15) base their reasoning on this general rule.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** The *endo rule* is a guideline, not an absolute law, and it is frequently overridden by strong steric repulsion. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is highly substituted and bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring must approach \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash and has a lower energy transition state. This makes the **exo adduct the major kinetic product**. A majority of the provided analyses (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13) correctly identify this exception. This is the more rigorous and chemically accurate reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The major product is the *exo* adduct, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### 3. Assign NMR Signals and Analyze the NOESY Spectrum\nWe are looking for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n*   **Signal Assignments:** Based on standard chemical shifts, the signals in the options are assigned as follows:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the product (`H_anhydride`). They are strongly deshielded by the neighboring carbonyl groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   **Major (*Exo*) Isomer:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. This brings the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected. The `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `Me_vinyl` protons.\n    *   **Minor (*Endo*) Isomer:** Here, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C bond. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far from the `H_bridge` protons but are very close to the `Me_vinyl` protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:** The cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one is the interaction between `H_anhydride` and `H_bridge`.\n\n### 4. Select the Final Answer\nThe key interaction connects the `H_anhydride` protons with one of the `H_bridge` protons.\n*   `H_anhydride` signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   `H_bridge` signal: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis pair of resonances is described in option B.\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This cross-peak is characteristic of the minor (*endo*) product.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This cross-peak is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Not a distinguishing interaction.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Not a distinguishing interaction.\n\nThe correct reasoning path leads to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving identifying reactants from spectroscopic data, determining the stereochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction, and interpreting a 2D NOESY NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data provided (`¹H`: a single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137 ppm, 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Its plane of symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (one ¹H peak) and the two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent, respectively (two ¹³C peaks).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the sum of the reactants' formulas (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct cycloaddition has occurred.\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical step of the problem. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle that predicts the *endo* product as the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule is frequently overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. In this specific case, the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) has bulky methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the anhydride ring would tuck underneath the diene system, causing a severe steric clash with these methyl groups.\n    *   To avoid this clash, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the reaction's outcome, reversing the usual preference.\n    *   Therefore, the correct stereochemical outcome is:\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n3.  **Assign Proton NMR Signals:**\n    *   Based on general chemical shifts, integrations, and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). They are heavily deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum based on 3D Structures:**\n    *   A **NOESY** spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n    *   We must find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*exo*) structure but far apart in the minor (*endo*) structure.\n    *   **In the Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (away from) the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are forced into the interior \"cup\" of the bicyclic system. This brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the C7-bridge (**H_bridge** at ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n    *   **In the Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are on the exterior face of the molecule, far away from the **H_bridge** protons. No significant NOESY cross-peak is expected between them. (Instead, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would be present in this minor isomer).\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the problem's description. The cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor is the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n5.  **Match the Conclusion to the Options:**\n    *   The interacting protons are **H_anhydride** (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and **H_bridge** (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n    *   This corresponds to the option describing a cross-peak between **\"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"**. This is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and reaching a final conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride has highly symmetrical NMR spectra: one ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. These characteristics, particularly the symmetry and chemical shifts (vinylic and carbonyl regions), are the classic signature of **maleic anhydride**. This conclusion is universally and correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition. The molecular formula of the products, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, matches the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition reaction.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical and decisive step of the analysis, where there is a major split in the reasoning of the candidate answers.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General \"Endo Rule\":** Under kinetic control, the *endo* product is typically favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups. Several candidate answers (e.g., 1, 8, 9, 14, 15) apply this general rule to conclude that the *endo* adduct is the major product.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** The endo rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this specific case, the diene is extremely bulky, with four methyl groups on its pi system. The methyl groups at the termini (C1 and C4) create a severe steric clash with the approaching anhydride ring in the transition state leading to the *endo* product. The *exo* approach avoids this clash, making its transition state lower in energy. This is a well-established exception to the endo rule.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The more sophisticated and chemically accurate reasoning, which is supported by a majority of the provided answers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13), correctly identifies that steric effects dominate. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of NMR Signals and NOESY Data\nWe are looking for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*)** but absent or weak in the minor product (*endo*).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signal Assignments:** Based on the integrations and typical chemical shifts provided in the options, we can assign the key proton signals:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7-methylene bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this isomer, a strong NOE between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would appear instead).\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a bridge proton. The resonances for these two groups are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This pair of signals directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The description of an anhydride derived from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with highly symmetrical NMR data (`¹H`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two peaks at 137, 165 ppm) unambiguously identifies the molecule as **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a simple cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   This is the most critical decision in the problem. The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle stating that the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. Several candidate answers rely on this general rule.\n    *   However, the endo rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the sterically less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n        *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    *   The chemically most accurate reasoning requires acknowledging this steric effect.\n\n3.  **Assign Proton NMR Signals:**\n    *   The problem describes four distinct proton environments in the product. Based on typical chemical shifts, integrals, and multiplicities, we can confidently assign them:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This represents one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum to Identify the Major Product:**\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**.\n    *   Since the major product is the **exo** adduct, we must find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *exo* structure.\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the bicyclic system from the C=C double bond bridge. This geometry points the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) towards the C7 methylene bridge, bringing them very close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C=C double bond bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak. (In this minor product, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would be expected instead).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak that is present only in the major (*exo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons and an **H_bridge** proton.\n    *   The corresponding signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This pair of resonances matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, focusing on stereochemistry and its spectroscopic consequences.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reaction Identification**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The first reactant is an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its spectroscopic data (a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This information unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry: Determining the Major Product**\n    *   This is the most critical step in solving the problem. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   The general \"Alder-Endo Rule\" predicts that the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored (and thus major) product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Many of the candidate answers rely on this general rule.\n    *   However, there is a crucial **exception** to this rule when significant steric hindrance is present. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. During the *endo* approach, the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions would sterically clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring.\n    *   To avoid this severe steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This makes the **exo adduct the major product** and the *endo* adduct the minor product. This is a classic textbook example of steric effects overriding electronic preferences.\n\n3.  **Proton Signal Assignment**\n    *   The problem provides several key signals from the product's ¹H NMR spectrum. Based on their chemical shift, integration, and multiplicity, we can assign them to specific protons in the bicyclic product (which possesses a plane of symmetry):\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are physically close to each other in 3D space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent in the minor one**. Since we determined the **Major product = *Exo*** and the **Minor product = *Endo***, we must find a spatial proximity unique to the *exo* isomer.\n    *   **In the *Exo* (Major) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7 methylene bridge. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the *Endo* (Minor) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked underneath the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, so the cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl would appear).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a methylene bridge proton.\n    *   These signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   Looking at the choices provided, this pair matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
