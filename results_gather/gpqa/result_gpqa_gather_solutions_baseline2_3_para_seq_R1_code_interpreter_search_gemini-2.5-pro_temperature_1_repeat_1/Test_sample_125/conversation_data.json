Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It possesses a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is already chiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs 3S). By definition, they are **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**2. Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, we must consider all possible stereoisomeric products.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) configurations are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) configuration has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) isomer describes the same meso molecule).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I + three from Reaction II).\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   From Reaction I: The two diastereomers will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak, while the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the pair) will elute separately. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve all five unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, the experiment will yield:\n*   **5 Peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.**\n*   **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.**\n\nThis conclusion matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two organic reactions and how the resulting product mixture is separated by two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its Products\n*   **Reactant**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon C5, specified as having the (S) configuration, is not directly involved in the reaction and will retain its configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of the ketone group (C=O) at C3 using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reaction converts the ketone into a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The carbonyl carbon at C3 is planar and prochiral. Its reduction creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl is diastereoselective, leading to the formation of two products with different stereochemistry at C3.\n*   **Products of Reaction I**: Two distinct products are formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion**: These two products have two stereocenters, differing in configuration at one center while being identical at the other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its Products\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces all possible stereoisomers, resulting in an overall optically inactive mixture. The symmetry of the product molecule leads to three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, the (2S, 4R) form).\n*   **Conclusion**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5** unique stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This gives a total of **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: Since the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different, they will all be resolved from each other. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle**: An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to create a chiral environment that allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis**: The final mixture contains five stereochemically distinct compounds. An ideal chiral HPLC column will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified as having the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The starting material is chiral. When a new stereocenter is created, the reaction is diastereoselective. The two possible configurations at the new C3 center (R and S) lead to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: The two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that differs (3R vs 3S). They are stereoisomers but not mirror images, which defines them as **diastereomers**. Thus, Reaction I produces **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, resulting in an overall optically inactive mixture.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a pair of **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images). They are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. The reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I + three from Reaction II).\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It **can** separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: This technique uses a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all unique stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers: (3R,5S)-alcohol, (3S,5S)-alcohol, (2R,4R)-diol, (2S,4S)-diol, and the meso-diol.\n    *   A chiral column is capable of resolving all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate responses and a first-principles review of the chemical problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and Its Products**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using a strong reducing agent (LAH). This converts the carbonyl group (C=O) into a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is already chiral (at C5, which is unaffected), the reduction is diastereoselective, producing two diastereomers.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces **two distinct diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and Its Products**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   One pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   One **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. (The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same molecule).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains a total of **five unique stereoisomers**: two diastereomers from Reaction I, and three stereoisomers (a meso compound and an enantiomeric pair) from Reaction II.\n\n**A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Counting:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be resolved into **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomers).\n    *   The products from the two different reactions are also structurally distinct and will separate from each other.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column can form transient diastereomeric interactions with all stereoisomers, allowing it to resolve enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Counting:**\n    *   The column is designed to separate every unique stereoisomer present.\n    *   The mixture contains a total of **five distinct stereoisomers**.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B. All of the provided candidate answers performed the same chemical analysis correctly; discrepancies in their final choice of letter were likely due to being presented with a different list of options. The chemical reasoning is unanimous and sound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it exists as a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The reduction of the planar carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (the C5 center is unaffected), the hydride attack on the two faces of the carbonyl group produces two different products. These products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, we analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I**: The two products are diastereomers, so they have different physical properties and will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II**: The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas) and will be separated from each other. Thus, the total number of peaks is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, by forming transient diastereomeric interactions.\n*   The final mixture contains **5 distinct stereoisomers**:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: A chiral column with sufficient resolving power will separate all five of these unique compounds. Therefore, **5 peaks** will be observed.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   Number of peaks in **chiral HPLC**: 5\n*   Number of peaks in **normal-phase HPLC**: 4\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct number of HPLC peaks.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction**: It is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent. This reaction reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the planar, prochiral ketone group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (due to C5, which is unaffected), the two possible products are not formed in a 1:1 ratio. The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I**: The two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reaction**: It is treated with excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We must consider all possible stereoisomers that can be formed from an achiral precursor.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n*   Two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   Three stereoisomers from Reaction II (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound).\n\n#### **A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: The products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be fully separated. Therefore, the total number of peaks is 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B. Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them. Each of the five unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and confirming the logic. The goal is to determine the number of distinct signals (peaks) observed in two different types of HPLC experiments.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has one existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar, prochiral ketone group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (due to the C5 stereocenter, which is unaffected), the attack of the hydride ion is diastereoselective, leading to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products have two stereocenters, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). They are stereoisomers but not mirror images, which makes them **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, we must analyze all possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase) = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **Analysis with Chiral HPLC**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   The mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.

A review of the candidate answers confirms that while their final letter choices are inconsistent (likely due to scrambled option lists), the scientific reasoning overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two separate organic reactions and then predicting how the combined products will behave in two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I and Its Products**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. The molecule possesses a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration. This chiral center is not involved in the reaction and will retain its configuration.\n    *   **Reaction:** The ketone group at carbon 3 (C3) is reduced by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. Its reduction creates a new chiral center.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two faces of the planar carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack by the hydride ion (H⁻) will lead to the formation of two different stereoisomers, with the new center at C3 having either an (R) or (S) configuration.\n    *   **Products:** The reaction produces two compounds: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since these molecules are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other (they differ at C3 but are the same at C5), they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** It yields **two** distinct diastereomeric products.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II and Its Products**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetrical and **achiral** molecule (it possesses a plane of symmetry).\n    *   **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4 (C2 and C4).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Because the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, but the overall mixture must be optically inactive.\n    *   **Products:** The possible stereoisomers are:\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** It yields **three** distinct stereoisomers (one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The final mixture contains the products from both reactions. The total number of unique stereoisomeric compounds is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 distinct compounds**.\n\n4.  **Predict HPLC Chromatogram on a Normal-Phase (Achiral) Column**\n    *   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Analysis of Mixture:**\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair).\n        *   The products from the two reactions are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂) and will be well separated.\n    *   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Predict HPLC Chromatogram on a Chiral Column**\n    *   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to form temporary, diastereomeric complexes with chiral molecules, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n    *   **Analysis of Mixture:** The column can resolve all stereochemically unique compounds.\n    *   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture, the chiral column will resolve all of them. This will result in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   The **chiral HPLC** chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n*   The **normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram will show **4 peaks**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified as having the (S) configuration, will not participate in the reaction.\n2.  **Reaction:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbon of the ketone group (C3) is prochiral, meaning its reduction creates a new stereocenter.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two faces of the planar ketone are diastereotopic. The hydride attack will create both (R) and (S) configurations at the new stereocenter (C3). This results in a mixture of two **diastereomers**:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces **2 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** Because the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed. Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This isomer is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry (the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces **3 distinct stereoisomers** (the meso compound and the two enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Separation by Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Combined Mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and **will be separated**, contributing **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules and will not accidentally co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Separation by Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to create a chiral environment that allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Combined Mixture:**\n    *   The total mixture contains 2 products from Reaction I and 3 products from Reaction II, for a total of **5 distinct stereoisomers**.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with each of these five unique molecules, resolving all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the chemist should observe:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found across the candidate answers.\n\n### **Careful Analysis of the Problem**\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a crucial point: the reactant is a **single, pure enantiomer**. It possesses a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a **new chiral center** at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since a new chiral center is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the products are **diastereomers**. The hydride ion attacks the planar carbonyl group, forming two possible products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: **Two distinct diastereomeric products** are formed.\n\n**2. Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an **achiral** molecule due to its symmetry (it has an internal plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄, creating pentane-2,4-diol. This creates **two new chiral centers** at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, the product mixture must be optically inactive. We must consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the exact same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: **Three distinct stereoisomers** are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The total number of unique chemical species in the final combined mixture is the sum of the products from both reactions: 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 total stereoisomers**.\n\n**4. Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle**:\n    *   The **two diastereomers** from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This yields **2 peaks**.\n    *   The **three stereoisomers** from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together (co-elute). This yields **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair).\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks**: Since the products of the two reactions are structurally distinct (different chemical formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂), there will be no accidental co-elution between the sets. Therefore, the total is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**5. Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to distinguish between stereoisomers, including the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Applying the principle**:\n    *   The column will separate every unique stereoisomer in the mixture.\n    *   Since there are **5 unique stereoisomers** in total (2 from Reaction I and 3 from Reaction II), a chiral column will resolve them all, assuming sufficient column efficiency.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks**: **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the mixture will show **5 peaks on the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks on the normal-phase HPLC**. This result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a single, pure enantiomer with one pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent that converts the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (the C5 stereocenter is unaffected by the reaction), the attack of the hydride ion on the two different faces of the planar carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This results in the formation of two distinct products:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products are **diastereomers** because they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other (they have one stereocenter in common and one that is opposite). Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting molecule is achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers that can be formed:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images and are therefore an **enantiomeric pair**. They are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, the reaction produces **three distinct stereoisomers**: a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase column is achiral.

It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated. The two enantiomers will co-elute (elute together). This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** The products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other. Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**HPLC with Chiral Stationary Phase:**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column is specifically designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, by forming transient diastereomeric complexes.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** The final mixture contains five stereochemically distinct compounds. An ideal chiral column will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 Peaks\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 Peaks\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the unanimous chemical reasoning provided by the candidate agents.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer with one chiral center at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3, while the original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the reaction is diastereoselective. It produces two stereoisomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** These two products are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule with an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, three distinct stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to its internal symmetry. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomeric compounds (one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\nThe total combined product mixture contains **five** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   Each of the **five** unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral column and, with sufficient resolution, will be separated.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that the chemist should observe:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the two different HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it has a single stereocenter at carbon C5, with a specific (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The reduction of the carbonyl group (C=O) at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. Since the starting material is already chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic, and the reaction produces two stereoisomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion**: The two products have two stereocenters, with one being identical (5S) and the other being opposite (3R vs. 3S). They are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, which defines them as **diastereomers**. Thus, Reaction I produces **2 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Because the starting material is symmetrical and achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion**: The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **3 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture and HPLC separation**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers will co-elute (elute together) as one peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to separate all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**: The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomeric compounds. The chiral column will interact differently with each of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at carbon C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group (which is prochiral) creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (at C5), the attack of the hydride on the two faces of the carbonyl is diastereoselective. This results in the formation of two stereoisomeric products where the original stereocenter (C5) remains (S), and the new one (C3) is either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** These two products are stereoisomers but not mirror images, making them **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, forming pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, we must analyze all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are a pair of non-superimposable mirror images. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **Meso Compound:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the exact same molecule).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.

It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This also results in -> **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting racemic pair).\n    *   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers** and diastereomers.\n    *   The total mixture contains 5 stereochemically distinct compounds.\n    *   A chiral column with sufficient resolution will separate all five unique compounds.\n    *   **Total Peaks (Chiral) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. Matching this outcome with the provided options:\n\nA) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct number of peaks observed in the chromatograms. The analysis consolidates the correct reasoning found across the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction I and its Products**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The reaction begins with `(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one`. This is a crucial point: the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 with a specific (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction**: The ketone group at carbon C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the hydride ion's attack on the two faces of the carbonyl is diastereoselective, producing two different stereoisomers:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Conclusion**: The two products have two stereocenters, but they are not mirror images of each other (one center is identical, the other is opposite). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction II and its Products**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: `Pentane-2,4-dione`. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**, as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: Because the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n4.  **Conclusion**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe final product mixture contains all the compounds produced, which are a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predicting Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This yields **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different physical properties and will be separated. The two enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomers).\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks**: The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different molecules and will not overlap. Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predicting Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The final mixture contains 5 stereochemically distinct compounds.\n    *   A chiral HPLC column, with adequate resolution, will separate each of these five unique compounds.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   The **normal-phase HPLC** will show **4 peaks**.\n*   The **chiral HPLC** will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option C in the provided question list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The original stereocenter at C5 remains unaffected.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products formed are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I**: It produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The reactant is **pentane-2,4-dione**. This molecule is **achiral** due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating pentane-2,4-diol. This creates **two new stereocenters** at C2 and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed. Analysis of the product's symmetry reveals three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.

It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, having identical properties in an achiral environment, will elute together (co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks**: Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions (which is a safe assumption given they have different molecular formulas), the total number of peaks is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase.

Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It possesses a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.

This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon C5, specified as having the (S) configuration, is not directly involved in the reaction and will retain its configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of the ketone group (C=O) at C3 using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reaction converts the ketone into a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The carbonyl carbon at C3 is planar and prochiral. Its reduction creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl is diastereoselective, leading to the formation of two products with different stereochemistry at C3.\n*   **Products of Reaction I**: Two distinct products are formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion**: These two products have two stereocenters, differing in configuration at one center while being identical at the other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its Products\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces all possible stereoisomers, resulting in an overall optically inactive mixture. The symmetry of the product molecule leads to three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, the (2S, 4R) form).\n*   **Conclusion**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5** unique stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This gives a total of **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: Since the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different, they will all be resolved from each other. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle**: An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to create a chiral environment that allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis**: The final mixture contains five stereochemically distinct compounds. An ideal chiral HPLC column will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram**.

This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The starting material is chiral. When a new stereocenter is created, the reaction is diastereoselective. The two possible configurations at the new C3 center (R and S) lead to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: The two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that differs (3R vs 3S). They are stereoisomers but not mirror images, which defines them as **diastereomers**. Thus, Reaction I produces **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, resulting in an overall optically inactive mixture.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a pair of **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).

This corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate responses and a first-principles review of the chemical problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and Its Products**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using a strong reducing agent (LAH). This converts the carbonyl group (C=O) into a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is already chiral (at C5, which is unaffected), the reduction is diastereoselective, producing two diastereomers.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces **two distinct diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and Its Products**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   One pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   One **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be resolved into **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomers).\n    *   The products from the two different reactions are also structurally distinct and will separate from each other.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n**B.

All of the provided candidate answers performed the same chemical analysis correctly; discrepancies in their final choice of letter were likely due to being presented with a different list of options. The chemical reasoning is unanimous and sound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it exists as a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The reduction of the planar carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (the C5 center is unaffected), the hydride attack on the two faces of the carbonyl group produces two different products. These products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, we analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I**: The two products are diastereomers, so they have different physical properties and will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II**: The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas) and will be separated from each other. Thus, the total number of peaks is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, by forming transient diastereomeric interactions.\n*   The final mixture contains **5 distinct stereoisomers**:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: A chiral column with sufficient resolving power will separate all five of these unique compounds. Therefore, **5 peaks** will be observed.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   Number of peaks in **chiral HPLC**: 5\n*   Number of peaks in **normal-phase HPLC**: 4\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct number of HPLC peaks.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction**: It is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent. This reaction reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the planar, prochiral ketone group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (due to C5, which is unaffected), the two possible products are not formed in a 1:1 ratio. The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I**: The two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reaction**: It is treated with excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We must consider all possible stereoisomers that can be formed from an achiral precursor.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n*   Two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   Three stereoisomers from Reaction II (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound).\n\n#### **A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: The products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be fully separated. Therefore, the total number of peaks is 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B. Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them. Each of the five unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and confirming the logic. The goal is to determine the number of distinct signals (peaks) observed in two different types of HPLC experiments.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has one existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar, prochiral ketone group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (due to the C5 stereocenter, which is unaffected), the attack of the hydride ion is diastereoselective, leading to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products have two stereocenters, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). They are stereoisomers but not mirror images, which makes them **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, we must analyze all possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase) = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **Analysis with Chiral HPLC**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   The mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these unique compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe:\n*   **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.**\n*   **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.**\n\nThis result matches option A from the question's list. A review of the candidate answers confirms that while their final letter choices are inconsistent (likely due to scrambled option lists), the scientific reasoning overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two separate organic reactions and then predicting how the combined products will behave in two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I and Its Products**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. The molecule possesses a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration. This chiral center is not involved in the reaction and will retain its configuration.\n    *   **Reaction:** The ketone group at carbon 3 (C3) is reduced by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. Its reduction creates a new chiral center.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two faces of the planar carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack by the hydride ion (H⁻) will lead to the formation of two different stereoisomers, with the new center at C3 having either an (R) or (S) configuration.\n    *   **Products:** The reaction produces two compounds: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since these molecules are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other (they differ at C3 but are the same at C5), they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** It yields **two** distinct diastereomeric products.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II and Its Products**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetrical and **achiral** molecule (it possesses a plane of symmetry).\n    *   **Reaction:** The molecule is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4 (C2 and C4).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Because the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed, but the overall mixture must be optically inactive.\n    *   **Products:** The possible stereoisomers are:\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** It yields **three** distinct stereoisomers (one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The final mixture contains the products from both reactions. The total number of unique stereoisomeric compounds is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 distinct compounds**.\n\n4.  **Predict HPLC Chromatogram on a Normal-Phase (Achiral) Column**\n    *   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Analysis of Mixture:**\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair).\n        *   The products from the two reactions are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂) and will be well separated.\n    *   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Predict HPLC Chromatogram on a Chiral Column**\n    *   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to form temporary, diastereomeric complexes with chiral molecules, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n    *   **Analysis of Mixture:** The column can resolve all stereochemically unique compounds.\n    *   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture, the chiral column will resolve all of them. This will result in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   The **chiral HPLC** chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n*   The **normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram will show **4 peaks**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified as having the (S) configuration, will not participate in the reaction.\n2.  **Reaction:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbon of the ketone group (C3) is prochiral, meaning its reduction creates a new stereocenter.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two faces of the planar ketone are diastereotopic. The hydride attack will create both (R) and (S) configurations at the new stereocenter (C3). This results in a mixture of two **diastereomers**:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces **2 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** Because the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed. Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This isomer is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry (the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces **3 distinct stereoisomers** (the meso compound and the two enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Separation by Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Combined Mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and **will be separated**, contributing **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules and will not accidentally co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Separation by Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to create a chiral environment that allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Combined Mixture:**\n    *   The total mixture contains 2 products from Reaction I and 3 products from Reaction II, for a total of **5 distinct stereoisomers**.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with each of these five unique molecules, resolving all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the chemist should observe:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found across the candidate answers.\n\n### **Careful Analysis of the Problem**\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a crucial point: the reactant is a **single, pure enantiomer**. It possesses a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a **new chiral center** at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since a new chiral center is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the products are **diastereomers**. The hydride ion attacks the planar carbonyl group, forming two possible products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: **Two distinct diastereomeric products** are formed.\n\n**2. Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an **achiral** molecule due to its symmetry (it has an internal plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄, creating pentane-2,4-diol. This creates **two new chiral centers** at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, the product mixture must be optically inactive. We must consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images and form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the exact same meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: **Three distinct stereoisomers** are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The total number of unique chemical species in the final combined mixture is the sum of the products from both reactions: 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 total stereoisomers**.\n\n**4. Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle**:\n    *   The **two diastereomers** from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This yields **2 peaks**.\n    *   The **three stereoisomers** from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together (co-elute). This yields **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair).\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks**: Since the products of the two reactions are structurally distinct (different chemical formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂), there will be no accidental co-elution between the sets. Therefore, the total is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**5. Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to distinguish between stereoisomers, including the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Applying the principle**:\n    *   The column will separate every unique stereoisomer in the mixture.\n    *   Since there are **5 unique stereoisomers** in total (2 from Reaction I and 3 from Reaction II), a chiral column will resolve them all, assuming sufficient column efficiency.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks**: **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the mixture will show **5 peaks on the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks on the normal-phase HPLC**. This result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a single, pure enantiomer with one pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent that converts the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (the C5 stereocenter is unaffected by the reaction), the attack of the hydride ion on the two different faces of the planar carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This results in the formation of two distinct products:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products are **diastereomers** because they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other (they have one stereocenter in common and one that is opposite). Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting molecule is achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers that can be formed:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images and are therefore an **enantiomeric pair**. They are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound).\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, the reaction produces **three distinct stereoisomers**: a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated. The two enantiomers will co-elute (elute together). This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** The products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other. Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**HPLC with Chiral Stationary Phase:**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column is specifically designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, by forming transient diastereomeric complexes.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** The final mixture contains five stereochemically distinct compounds. An ideal chiral column will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 Peaks\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 Peaks\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the unanimous chemical reasoning provided by the candidate agents.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer with one chiral center at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3, while the original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the reaction is diastereoselective. It produces two stereoisomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion:** These two products are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule with an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, three distinct stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to its internal symmetry. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomeric compounds (one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separations**\nThe total combined product mixture contains **five** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   Each of the **five** unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral column and, with sufficient resolution, will be separated.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that the chemist should observe:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the two different HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it has a single stereocenter at carbon C5, with a specific (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The reduction of the carbonyl group (C=O) at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. Since the starting material is already chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic, and the reaction produces two stereoisomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion**: The two products have two stereocenters, with one being identical (5S) and the other being opposite (3R vs. 3S). They are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, which defines them as **diastereomers**. Thus, Reaction I produces **2 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Because the starting material is symmetrical and achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion**: The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **3 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture and HPLC separation**\n\nThe final product mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers will co-elute (elute together) as one peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase)**: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to separate all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**: The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomeric compounds. The chiral column will interact differently with each of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral)**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral ketone. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at carbon C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group (which is prochiral) creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting molecule is already chiral (at C5), the attack of the hydride on the two faces of the carbonyl is diastereoselective. This results in the formation of two stereoisomeric products where the original stereocenter (C5) remains (S), and the new one (C3) is either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** These two products are stereoisomers but not mirror images, making them **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, forming pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, we must analyze all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are a pair of non-superimposable mirror images. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **Meso Compound:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration describes the exact same molecule).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.

It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This also results in -> **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting racemic pair).\n    *   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers** and diastereomers.\n    *   The total mixture contains 5 stereochemically distinct compounds.\n    *   A chiral column with sufficient resolution will separate all five unique compounds.\n    *   **Total Peaks (Chiral) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. Matching this outcome with the provided options:\n\nA) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct number of peaks observed in the chromatograms. The analysis consolidates the correct reasoning found across the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction I and its Products**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The reaction begins with `(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one`. This is a crucial point: the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 with a specific (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction**: The ketone group at carbon C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the hydride ion's attack on the two faces of the carbonyl is diastereoselective, producing two different stereoisomers:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Conclusion**: The two products have two stereocenters, but they are not mirror images of each other (one center is identical, the other is opposite). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction II and its Products**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: `Pentane-2,4-dione`. This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**, as it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: Because the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule).\n4.  **Conclusion**: Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe final product mixture contains all the compounds produced, which are a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predicting Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This yields **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different physical properties and will be separated. The two enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomers).\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks**: The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different molecules and will not overlap. Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predicting Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**:\n    *   The final mixture contains 5 stereochemically distinct compounds.\n    *   A chiral HPLC column, with adequate resolution, will separate each of these five unique compounds.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks**: **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   The **normal-phase HPLC** will show **4 peaks**.\n*   The **chiral HPLC** will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option C in the provided question list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
