Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step derivation to reach the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism. This will be compound (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This process requires an alpha-hydrogen (α-H). An α-H is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is crucial for the mechanism.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups and three -CH₂- groups alternating in a ring. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to C=O groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is especially stable due to aromaticity.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure has two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. It lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This will be compound (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since it has a chiral center and lacks any overriding symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is the *trans* isomer CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not have a chiral center and is achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Combine Results and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the option that correctly identifies both compounds.\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate,\" corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a two-part chemical analysis to arrive at the correct answer. The reasoning can be broken down step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism\n\n**The Question:** Which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism? This compound is designated as (A).\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis:**\n1.  **Define the Key Principle:** Tautomerism, in this context, refers to keto-enol tautomerism. The crucial requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **Examine Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione possesses the necessary alpha-hydrogens and therefore **does** exhibit tautomerism. It readily converts to its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n3.  **Examine Benzoquinone:**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring containing two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, so it **does not** exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Decision for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism\n\n**The Question:** Which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism? This compound is designated as (B).\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis:**\n1.  **Define the Key Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Examine Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism.\n3.  **Examine Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no carbon bonded to four different groups (no chiral center). Furthermore, it possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Decision for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Synthesis and Answer Selection\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the options provided in the question:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct pairing derived from the chemical principles matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of chemical principles from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: To identify which compound between `benzoquinone` and `cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione` does **not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated as (A).\n\n1.  **Chemical Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism discussed here is keto-enol tautomerism. A critical requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\" (α-H), which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). The molecule can then rearrange to form an \"enol\" (a C=C double bond with an -OH group).\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a ring structure with three carbonyl (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. The hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule's structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for (A)**: All candidate answers correctly conclude that the compound which does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: To identify which compound between `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` and `dimethyl fumarate` **will show** optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n1.  **Chemical Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause for chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to four distinctly different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is a *trans*-alkene. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for (B)**: All candidate answers correctly conclude that the compound which will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   **Compound (A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **Compound (B)**, which does show optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this pair to the given options in the question:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from the unanimous and correct chemical reasoning perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and established chemical principles.\n\n### **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe first part of the question asks to identify the compound from the pair (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) that **does not** show tautomerism. This compound will be designated (A).\n\n1.  **Guiding Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism, keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium that requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (α-H). This is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule consists of a six-membered ring where three ketone groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyls, making their hydrogens alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is highly stabilized by aromaticity.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the ketone groups are part of the double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. They lack the required type of alpha-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers are in unanimous agreement on this point.\n\n### **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound from the pair (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate & dimethyl fumarate) **will** show optical isomerism. This compound will be designated (B).\n\n1.  **Guiding Principle**: Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ in the *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for (B)**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers are also in unanimous agreement on this point.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have:\n*   Compound (A) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound (B) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we must match this conclusion to the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   **B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe analysis directly matches the contents of option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\nThe problem is composed of two independent questions.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe first task is to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Understand Keto-Enol Tautomerism.** For a compound to exhibit this common type of tautomerism, it must have an \"alpha-hydrogen\". This is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is directly adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups and three -CH₂- groups alternating. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity, making tautomerism highly favorable.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized and do not possess the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Understand Optical Isomerism and Chirality.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is a \"chiral center\" — a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since it has a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* arrangement. The molecule lacks a chiral center. Furthermore, it possesses elements of symmetry (specifically a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry), which make it an achiral molecule. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both parts:\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, let's match this result with the provided options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from a correct chemical analysis perfectly matches the description in option B. The vast majority of the candidate answers came to the same logical conclusion in their reasoning, even if some of them selected the wrong final letter. The correct reasoning unanimously supports this choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, from benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism. This compound will be designated as (A).\n\n1.  **Key Principle:** The most common type of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit this, it must possess an alpha-hydrogen (α-H). An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group (C=O). Crucially, this alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized for the standard mechanism to proceed.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are alpha-hydrogens.

These carbons are sp²-hybridized. They do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens (on an sp³ carbon) required for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Decision for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, from methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism. This compound will be designated as (B).\n\n1.  **Key Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.

We will analyze each one separately and then combine the results to select the final correct option.\n\n### **Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Question**: Identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism. Let's call this compound (A).\n\n1.  **Guiding Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. A crucial requirement for this interconversion is the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen). For the typical mechanism to proceed, this alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring containing three ketone groups (C=O) that alternate with three methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens**: The carbons of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to two carbonyl groups each. Therefore, the hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism. Its enol form (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene, or phloroglucinol) is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens**: The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and lack the specific type of alpha-hydrogen (on an sp³ carbon) required for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part 1**: The compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Question**: Identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism. Let's call this compound (B).\n\n1.  **Guiding Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The key requirement for this process is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\" — a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Therefore, the hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily undergo tautomerism to form a very stable aromatic enol (phloroglucinol). Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Benzoquinone:** This compound consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. This means they are sp²-hybridized and lack the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n*   **Core Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon in the chain (the one bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* arrangement across the double bond. The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups (no chiral center). Furthermore, it is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it an achiral molecule. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination is presented in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does NOT show tautomerism (A)**\n\n1.  **Define Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are readily interconvertible. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. The primary requirement for a ketone to exhibit this tautomerism is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups.\n    *   The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized.\n    *   They are adjacent to the carbonyl groups, making the hydrogens attached to them alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to exhibit tautomerism. It readily converts into its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol. Therefore, this compound **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry around the C=C double bond.\n    *   This molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center at the midpoint of the double bond). It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it is achiral, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Decision for Part B:** The compound (B) that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion and Careful Points:**\n\n*   **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).\n*   **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).\n\nNow, we match this combination with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct pairing matches **Option D**. It's important to carefully map the derived conclusions to the options as presented in the problem statement. The candidate answers showed consistent chemical reasoning but were inconsistent in selecting the final letter, likely due to different option labeling in their respective contexts. Based on the problem as stated, D is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of the provided solutions and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Requirement:** The question asks to identify which compound does **not** show tautomerism. The relevant type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for this process is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound's structure consists of a six-membered ring where three ketone (C=O) groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens, as they are attached to sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism**. Its enol form is phloroglucinol, which is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** This compound has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and lack the specific type of alpha-hydrogen required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. All 15 candidate answers unanimously agree on this point.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Requirement:** The question asks to identify which compound **will** show optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator for this is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four unique groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). It is a planar molecule with no chiral centers and possesses a center of symmetry. Achiral molecules are not optically active. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All 15 candidate answers also unanimously agree on this.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon analysis:\n*   Compound A (the one that does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (the one that shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis pair needs to be matched with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination derived from the analysis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question has two independent parts:\n*   **Part A**: From the pair (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione), identify the compound that **does not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Part B**: From the pair (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate & dimethyl fumarate), identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism.\n\nThe final answer will be the option that correctly identifies both compounds.\n\n**2. Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Underlying Principle:** Tautomerism, in this context, refers to keto-enol tautomerism. This chemical equilibrium requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen), which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The presence of this α-hydrogen allows the molecule to interconvert between its keto (carbonyl) and enol (alcohol on a double bond) forms.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups separated by three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens attached to these carbons are α-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is highly stable due to aromaticity.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks α-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**3. Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Underlying Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Final Answer**\n\n*   For part (A), the compound is **benzoquinone**.\n*   For part (B), the compound is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe must find the option that matches `A = benzoquinone` and `B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`. Let's review the options given in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOur derived result perfectly matches the content of option A.\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\n*   All candidate answers provided show a correct and unanimous understanding of the chemical principles for both tautomerism and optical isomerism.\n*   The reasoning in all cases correctly identifies benzoquinone (for A) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (for B).\n*   The disparity in the final letters chosen (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers stems from the fact that they were likely presented with differently ordered lists of multiple-choice options.\n*   Based on the canonical list of options provided in the problem statement, the correct combination of answers corresponds definitively to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe task requires me to solve a two-part chemistry problem and then select the corresponding correct option from the provided list.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe first part of the question asks to identify which compound, out of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Principle:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a ketone form (keto) and an alcohol-alkene form (enol). A critical requirement for a molecule to undergo this process is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom bonded to an sp³-hybridized carbon that is adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule's structure is a six-membered ring containing three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The hydrogens on these methylene groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens, as they are attached to sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyls. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound and is particularly stable.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** This molecule's structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. These carbons do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism, which we label as (A), is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound, out of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that results in chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain (the one bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four unique groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl Fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry across the double bond. The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it has a center of symmetry and is planar, making it an achiral molecule. Achiral molecules are not optically active. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism, which we label as (B), is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Conclusion and Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have determined:\n*   Compound (A) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound (B) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we match this pair to the official options provided in the question:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination we derived correctly matches option D.\n\n**Careful Point on Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly identified the chemical properties of each compound. The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) stems from them using differently ordered option lists in their individual responses. However, the underlying scientific reasoning is unanimous and sound, pointing to the same combination of compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and established chemical principles.\n\n**Part 1: Analyzing Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **The Question**: Identify which of the two compounds, **benzoquinone** or **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism.\n2.  **The Chemical Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone to tautomerize into an enol, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen). Critically, this alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized to allow for the rearrangement of bonds.\n3.  **Applying the Principle**:\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyls. Therefore, they have the required alpha-hydrogens. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism, readily converting to its very stable aromatic enol form (phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Benzoquinone**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **The Question**: Identify which of the two compounds, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** or **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism.\n2.  **The Chemical Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n3.  **Applying the Principle**:\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since the central carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis and Answer Selection**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the options provided in the original question prompt:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOur derived result, (A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis to determine the correct compounds for labels (A) and (B), followed by selecting the matching multiple-choice option.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Core Principle:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). The essential requirement for this interconversion is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (α-H), which is a hydrogen atom attached to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring structure with three carbonyl (C=O) groups separated by three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Therefore, the hydrogens attached to them are α-hydrogens. Because of these available α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism, readily converting to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required α-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Core Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry, it is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the provided options:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination of our findings corresponds exactly with option B.

Careful verification against the provided option list is crucial.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\nThe problem asks us to solve two separate chemical questions and then combine the results to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does NOT show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Chemical Principle:** Tautomerism, in this context, refers to keto-enol tautomerism. This process requires a molecule to have an alpha-hydrogen (α-H), which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom located adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   This compound consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens because they are on sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism. It readily converts to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   This compound is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   Since it lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that WILL show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Chemical Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon itself. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry around the double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups (no chiral center). Furthermore, it possesses elements of symmetry (a plane and a center of inversion) that make it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Synthesis**\n\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nWe now match this correct pair with the provided options:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe analysis correctly identifies the pair listed in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate solutions and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Question**: Identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated as (A).\n*   **Key Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism for these compounds is keto-enol tautomerism. A crucial requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups and three -CH₂- groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure contains C=O groups and C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, making them sp²-hybridized. It lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers are in unanimous agreement on this point based on their reasoning.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Question**: Identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n*   **Key Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: (-H), (-OH), (-CH₃), and (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center and lacks an internal plane of symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule has no chiral centers. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers are also in unanimous agreement on this point.\n\n**Step 3: Combine Results and Final Decision**\n\nBased on the universally correct reasoning provided by all candidate agents:\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this combination with the options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination `A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n**Careful Point**: The reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and consistent. The variation in their final selected letters (A, B, C, D) is due to them being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice lists. The correct final answer must be determined by matching the correct chemical conclusions to the specific list of options given in this problem's prompt.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This will be compound (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This process requires an alpha-hydrogen (α-H). An α-H is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is crucial for the mechanism.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups and three -CH₂- groups alternating in a ring. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to C=O groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is especially stable due to aromaticity.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure has two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. It lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This will be compound (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

This molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not have a chiral center and is achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Combine Results and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the option that correctly identifies both compounds.\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate,\" corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a two-part chemical analysis to arrive at the correct answer. The reasoning can be broken down step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism\n\n**The Question:** Which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism? This compound is designated as (A).\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis:**\n1.  **Define the Key Principle:** Tautomerism, in this context, refers to keto-enol tautomerism. The crucial requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **Examine Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione possesses the necessary alpha-hydrogens and therefore **does** exhibit tautomerism. It readily converts to its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n3.  **Examine Benzoquinone:**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring containing two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, so it **does not** exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Decision for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism\n\n**The Question:** Which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism? This compound is designated as (B).\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis:**\n1.  **Define the Key Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Examine Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism.\n3.  **Examine Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no carbon bonded to four different groups (no chiral center).

This compound is designated as (A).\n\n1.  **Chemical Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism discussed here is keto-enol tautomerism. A critical requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\" (α-H), which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). The molecule can then rearrange to form an \"enol\" (a C=C double bond with an -OH group).\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a ring structure with three carbonyl (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. The hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule's structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for (A)**: All candidate answers correctly conclude that the compound which does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: To identify which compound between `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` and `dimethyl fumarate` **will show** optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n1.  **Chemical Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause for chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to four distinctly different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is a *trans*-alkene. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers.

This compound will be designated (A).\n\n1.  **Guiding Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism, keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium that requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (α-H). This is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule consists of a six-membered ring where three ketone groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyls, making their hydrogens alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is highly stabilized by aromaticity.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the ketone groups are part of the double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. They lack the required type of alpha-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers are in unanimous agreement on this point.\n\n### **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound from the pair (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate & dimethyl fumarate) **will** show optical isomerism. This compound will be designated (B).\n\n1.  **Guiding Principle**: Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ in the *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for (B)**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

This is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is directly adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups and three -CH₂- groups alternating. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity, making tautomerism highly favorable.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized and do not possess the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Understand Optical Isomerism and Chirality.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is a \"chiral center\" — a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since it has a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* arrangement. The molecule lacks a chiral center. Furthermore, it possesses elements of symmetry (specifically a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry), which make it an achiral molecule. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both parts:\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, let's match this result with the provided options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from a correct chemical analysis perfectly matches the description in option B. The vast majority of the candidate answers came to the same logical conclusion in their reasoning, even if some of them selected the wrong final letter. The correct reasoning unanimously supports this choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, from benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism. This compound will be designated as (A).\n\n1.  **Key Principle:** The most common type of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit this, it must possess an alpha-hydrogen (α-H). An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group (C=O). Crucially, this alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized for the standard mechanism to proceed.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are alpha-hydrogens. They are attached to sp³-hybridized carbons, and those carbons are adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has the necessary structural features and **does** exhibit tautomerism. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is highly stable due to being an aromatic compound.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized. They do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens (on an sp³ carbon) required for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Decision for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, from methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism. This compound will be designated as (B).\n\n1.  **Key Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it possesses a chiral center and lacks symmetry, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule has no chiral centers. It is also planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Achiral molecules are superimposable on their mirror images.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Decision for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Final Combination and Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Compound A** (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   **Compound B** (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we match this result to the given options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   **B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from the analysis matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem is composed of two independent questions. We will analyze each one separately and then combine the results to select the final correct option.\n\n### **Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Question**: Identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism. Let's call this compound (A).\n\n1.  **Guiding Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. A crucial requirement for this interconversion is the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen). For the typical mechanism to proceed, this alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring containing three ketone groups (C=O) that alternate with three methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens**: The carbons of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to two carbonyl groups each. Therefore, the hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism. Its enol form (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene, or phloroglucinol) is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens**: The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and lack the specific type of alpha-hydrogen (on an sp³ carbon) required for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part 1**: The compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Question**: Identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism. Let's call this compound (B).\n\n1.  **Guiding Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center**: The second carbon atom (C2, bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since C2 is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an overriding element of symmetry, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl Fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality**: The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses a center of symmetry (in the middle of the C=C bond) and is planar, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since it is achiral, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part 2**: The compound (B) that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined:\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow we match this pair with the given options:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOur derived result matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Core Principle:** Keto-enol tautomerism is an equilibrium between a ketone/aldehyde form (keto) and its isomer containing a hydroxyl group bonded to a double-bonded carbon (enol). The key requirement for this process is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\" — a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Therefore, the hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily undergo tautomerism to form a very stable aromatic enol (phloroglucinol). Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Benzoquinone:** This compound consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. This means they are sp²-hybridized and lack the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n*   **Core Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* arrangement across the double bond. The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups (no chiral center). Furthermore, it is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it an achiral molecule. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination is presented in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does NOT show tautomerism (A)**\n\n1.  **Define Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are readily interconvertible. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. The primary requirement for a ketone to exhibit this tautomerism is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups.\n    *   The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized.\n    *   They are adjacent to the carbonyl groups, making the hydrogens attached to them alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to exhibit tautomerism. It readily converts into its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol. Therefore, this compound **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized.

It is attached to four distinct groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry around the C=C double bond.\n    *   This molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center at the midpoint of the double bond). It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it is achiral, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Decision for Part B:** The compound (B) that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion and Careful Points:**\n\n*   **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).\n*   **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).\n\nNow, we match this combination with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct pairing matches **Option D**. It's important to carefully map the derived conclusions to the options as presented in the problem statement.

Based on the problem as stated, D is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of the provided solutions and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Requirement:** The question asks to identify which compound does **not** show tautomerism. The relevant type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for this process is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound's structure consists of a six-membered ring where three ketone (C=O) groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens, as they are attached to sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism**. Its enol form is phloroglucinol, which is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** This compound has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and lack the specific type of alpha-hydrogen required for standard keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. All 15 candidate answers unanimously agree on this point.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Requirement:** The question asks to identify which compound **will** show optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator for this is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four unique groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). It is a planar molecule with no chiral centers and possesses a center of symmetry. Achiral molecules are not optically active. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All 15 candidate answers also unanimously agree on this.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon analysis:\n*   Compound A (the one that does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (the one that shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis pair needs to be matched with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination derived from the analysis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question has two independent parts:\n*   **Part A**: From the pair (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione), identify the compound that **does not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Part B**: From the pair (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate & dimethyl fumarate), identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism.\n\nThe final answer will be the option that correctly identifies both compounds.\n\n**2. Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Underlying Principle:** Tautomerism, in this context, refers to keto-enol tautomerism. This chemical equilibrium requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen), which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The presence of this α-hydrogen allows the molecule to interconvert between its keto (carbonyl) and enol (alcohol on a double bond) forms.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups separated by three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens attached to these carbons are α-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is highly stable due to aromaticity.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks α-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**3. Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Underlying Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Final Answer**\n\n*   For part (A), the compound is **benzoquinone**.\n*   For part (B), the compound is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe must find the option that matches `A = benzoquinone` and `B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`. Let's review the options given in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOur derived result perfectly matches the content of option A.\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\n*   All candidate answers provided show a correct and unanimous understanding of the chemical principles for both tautomerism and optical isomerism.\n*   The reasoning in all cases correctly identifies benzoquinone (for A) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (for B).\n*   The disparity in the final letters chosen (A, B, C, or D) across the different answers stems from the fact that they were likely presented with differently ordered lists of multiple-choice options.\n*   Based on the canonical list of options provided in the problem statement, the correct combination of answers corresponds definitively to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe task requires me to solve a two-part chemistry problem and then select the corresponding correct option from the provided list.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThe first part of the question asks to identify which compound, out of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Principle:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a ketone form (keto) and an alcohol-alkene form (enol). A critical requirement for a molecule to undergo this process is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom bonded to an sp³-hybridized carbon that is adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule's structure is a six-membered ring containing three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The hydrogens on these methylene groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens, as they are attached to sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyls. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is an aromatic compound and is particularly stable.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:** This molecule's structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. These carbons do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism, which we label as (A), is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound, out of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that results in chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain (the one bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four unique groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl Fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry across the double bond. The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it has a center of symmetry and is planar, making it an achiral molecule. Achiral molecules are not optically active. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism, which we label as (B), is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Conclusion and Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have determined:\n*   Compound (A) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound (B) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nNow, we match this pair to the official options provided in the question:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination we derived correctly matches option D.\n\n**Careful Point on Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly identified the chemical properties of each compound. The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) stems from them using differently ordered option lists in their individual responses. However, the underlying scientific reasoning is unanimous and sound, pointing to the same combination of compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and established chemical principles.\n\n**Part 1: Analyzing Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **The Question**: Identify which of the two compounds, **benzoquinone** or **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism.\n2.  **The Chemical Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone to tautomerize into an enol, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen). Critically, this alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized to allow for the rearrangement of bonds.\n3.  **Applying the Principle**:\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyls. Therefore, they have the required alpha-hydrogens. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism, readily converting to its very stable aromatic enol form (phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Benzoquinone**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **The Question**: Identify which of the two compounds, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** or **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism.\n2.  **The Chemical Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n3.  **Applying the Principle**:\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since the central carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis and Answer Selection**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the options provided in the original question prompt:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOur derived result, (A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis to determine the correct compounds for labels (A) and (B), followed by selecting the matching multiple-choice option.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Core Principle:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). The essential requirement for this interconversion is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (α-H), which is a hydrogen atom attached to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring structure with three carbonyl (C=O) groups separated by three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Therefore, the hydrogens attached to them are α-hydrogens. Because of these available α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism, readily converting to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required α-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Core Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry, it is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the provided options:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination of our findings corresponds exactly with option B. It is worth noting that while the chemical reasoning provided in all the candidate answers is almost unanimously correct, many of them make a simple error in matching their correct result to the final lettered option. Careful verification against the provided option list is crucial.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\nThe problem asks us to solve two separate chemical questions and then combine the results to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does NOT show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Chemical Principle:** Tautomerism, in this context, refers to keto-enol tautomerism. This process requires a molecule to have an alpha-hydrogen (α-H), which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom located adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   This compound consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens because they are on sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism. It readily converts to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   This compound is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   Since it lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that WILL show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Chemical Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon itself. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* geometry around the double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups (no chiral center). Furthermore, it possesses elements of symmetry (a plane and a center of inversion) that make it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Synthesis**\n\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nWe now match this correct pair with the provided options:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe analysis correctly identifies the pair listed in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
