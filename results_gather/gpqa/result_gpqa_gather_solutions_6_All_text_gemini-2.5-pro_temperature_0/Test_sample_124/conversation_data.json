This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes ($x, y, z$).\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning it can be treated as the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    *   The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    *   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n        $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   This simplifies to $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$. The \"excited state\" count starts from the ground state.\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This is the state in question, corresponding to $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    *   **Method 1: Formula:** The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n        For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   **Method 2: Enumeration:** We can list the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — **3 states**.\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — **6 states**.\n        *   The single combination (1, 1, 1) — **1 state**.\n        The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    *   B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n    *   C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n    *   D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\nThe calculated result matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **System Identification:** It is crucial to recognize the potential $V(r) \\propto r^2$ as a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options C and D, which are proportional to $\\hbar^2/(mr^2)$, are characteristic of a different system (the particle in an infinite spherical well) and are incorrect for this problem.\n*   **State Indexing:** The ground state corresponds to $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$. A common mistake is to assume the third excited state is $n=2$.\n*   **Dimensionality:** The zero-point energy for the 3D oscillator is $(3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, not $(1/2)\\hbar\\omega$ which is for the 1D case. The '3' in the numerator correctly accounts for the three spatial dimensions.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy calculation must account for all possible combinations of the quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$. Using the formula $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$ is the most reliable method and avoids errors that can occur during manual enumeration.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Physical System and Energy Formula\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes ($x, y, z$).\n\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy eigenvalue is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\nThe energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nThe total energy for the 3D system is:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$, starting from the ground state.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to counting the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of combinations where $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations explicitly:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n*   The single combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct System Identification**: The potential $V(r) \\propto r^2$ is for a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options A and B, which are proportional to $\\hbar^2 / (mr^2)$, are characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical well and are incorrect for this problem.\n2.  **Correct State Indexing**: The ground state corresponds to $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$, not $n=2$. This is a common point of error.\n3.  **Correct Degeneracy Calculation**: The degeneracy calculation must account for all possible combinations of the quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$. Using the formula $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$ is the most direct method and avoids missing any combinations.\n4.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the energy as $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy as 10. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to the options being presented in a different order for each agent.

Finally, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and match the result to the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, which describes a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for all three dimensions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Formula:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$. The principal quantum number, $n$, is the sum of the quantum numbers for each Cartesian dimension ($n = n_x + n_y + n_z$), where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n3.  **Find the Quantum Number for the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are ordered by increasing values of $n$.\n    *   Ground State: $n=0$\n    *   First Excited State: $n=1$\n    *   Second Excited State: $n=2$\n    *   **Third Excited State: $n=3$**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy:** I will substitute $n=3$ into the energy formula:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    This result immediately eliminates options A and D, as their energy formula, proportional to $\\hbar^2/(mr^2)$, corresponds to a different system (an infinite spherical well).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy, $g_n$, is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level $E_n$.

This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes ($x, y, z$).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning it can be treated as the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n*   The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by the formula: $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n*   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n*   This simplifies to: $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels can be expressed as:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$.

The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations in all three Cartesian directions.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$), meaning it can be treated as the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators. The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**2.

Any discrepancies in their final letter choice are due to the options being presented in a different order in their respective contexts.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Physical System and its Energy Formula\nThe problem describes a particle in a potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, meaning the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes (x, y, z).\n\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. This means the total energy eigenvalue, $E$, is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators. The energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nFor the 3D system, the total energy is:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy formula simplifies to:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$. The \"ground state\" is the lowest energy level, and the excited states are the levels above it.\n*   **Ground State:** Corresponds to $n=0$. Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=1$. Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=2$. Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=3$. Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to counting the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of combinations such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations manually:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states.\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states.\n*   The single combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (the degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **System Identification**: It is crucial to recognize the potential as that of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator and not confuse it with other systems like the hydrogen atom or a particle in a spherical box. The energy expressions in options B and D are for a particle in an infinite spherical well, which is incorrect here.\n2.  **State Indexing**: A common mistake is to misidentify the excited state. The ground state corresponds to $n=0$, so the *first* excited state is $n=1$, the *second* is $n=2$, and the *third* is $n=3$.\n3.  **Degeneracy Calculation**: While manual enumeration is possible for small $n$, it is easy to miss a combination. Using the general formula $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ is more reliable and less error-prone.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe energy of the third excited state ($n=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for this energy is 10.

The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes ($x, y, z$).\n\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy eigenvalue is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\nThe energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nThe total energy for the 3D system is:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$. The states are ordered by increasing energy.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$. Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.

Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (i.e., linearly independent eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n1.

Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$, not $n=2$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for $n=3$ is 10. A common mistake is to miscalculate this; for example, the degeneracy for $n=1$ is 3, which matches the incorrect value in option D.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly derive the energy as $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy as 10.

Analysis of the Physical System\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The key features are:\n*   **Three-dimensional**: The particle moves in 3D space.\n*   **Isotropic**: The potential is spherically symmetric, meaning the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes (x, y, z).\n*   **Separable Hamiltonian**: The potential can be written as $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2(x^2+y^2+z^2)$. This allows the Schrödinger equation to be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator problems.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Energy Eigenvalue\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nFor the 3D system, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThe question asks for the energy of the **third excited state**. We must first identify the correct quantum number $n$ for this state.\n*   **Ground State**: This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State**: This corresponds to $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State**: This corresponds to $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State**: This corresponds to $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Degeneracy\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy is its degeneracy. This is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — **3 states**\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — **6 states**\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — **1 state**\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### 4. Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   **System Identification**: The potential is for a harmonic oscillator, not a particle in a box. The options with energy proportional to $\\hbar^2/(mr^2)$ are distractors for the infinite spherical well potential and are incorrect.\n*   **State Indexing**: The ground state is $n=0$. The \"third excited state\" is correctly identified as $n=3$.\n*   **Calculation Consistency**: All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the energy as $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy as 10. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to the options being presented in a different order for each agent. The underlying physics is unanimously agreed upon.\n\nBased on the analysis, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.

As correctly identified by all candidate answers, this is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" is key, as it implies the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). This allows the problem to be treated as three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    *   The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    *   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n        $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$, starting from the ground state.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The value of the energy for the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. This result correctly eliminates options C and D.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, $n=3$.\n    *   **Method 1: Formula.** The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n        For $n=3$, the degeneracy is $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   **Method 2: Enumeration.** We can list the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n    There are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Energy Formula:** It is essential to use the energy formula for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$. The energy expressions in options C and D are characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical well and are incorrect for this system.\n*   **Correct State Identification:** The ground state corresponds to $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$. A common error in such problems is to mistake the third excited state for $n=2$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy calculation must account for all possible combinations of the quantum numbers that sum to $n$. Using the formula $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$ is the most direct method and confirms the result from manual enumeration.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the energy as $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy as 10.

Analysis of the Physical System\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The key features are:\n*   **Three-dimensional**: The particle moves in 3D space.\n*   **Isotropic**: The potential is spherically symmetric, meaning the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes (x, y, z).\n*   **Separable Hamiltonian**: The potential can be written as $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2(x^2+y^2+z^2)$. This allows the Schrödinger equation to be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator problems.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Energy Eigenvalue\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nFor the 3D system, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThe question asks for the energy of the **third excited state**. We must first identify the correct quantum number $n$ for this state.\n*   **Ground State**: This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State**: This corresponds to $n=1$.

A common mistake is to assume the third excited state is $n=2$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy calculation must account for all possible combinations of the quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$.

All the provided candidate answers correctly derived the physical values, even if some selected the wrong final letter due to a different ordering of options in their context. The underlying physics is unambiguous.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. As correctly identified by all candidate answers, this is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). The total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    *   The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$\n    *   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum:\n        $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy formula simplifies to:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$. The counting starts from the ground state.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The energy of the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we must find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be verified by listing the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Energy Formula:** It is crucial to use the energy formula for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$. The energy expressions in options C and D, which are proportional to $\\hbar^2/(mr^2)$, are characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical well and are incorrect for this system.\n*   **Correct State Indexing:** The ground state corresponds to $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$. A common error is to mistake the third excited state for $n=2$.\n*   **Correct Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for the $n=3$ state is 10. Option A incorrectly lists the degeneracy as 3.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly derive the energy as $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy as 10. The different final letters chosen (A, B, C, D) are due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent. The underlying physical conclusion is unanimous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.
