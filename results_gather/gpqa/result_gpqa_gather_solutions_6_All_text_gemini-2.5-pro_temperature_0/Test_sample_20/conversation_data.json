In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** The key concept here is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to undergo this type of isomerization, it must possess at least one \"alpha-hydrogen.\" An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is an sp³ hybridized CH₂ group, meaning they possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. These carbons are sp² hybridized and lack the required type of alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon that can easily participate in keto-enol tautomerization. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to its corresponding phenol-like structure, hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂), involves a change in the molecular formula and is a reduction reaction, not a tautomeric equilibrium. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that causes chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since the four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Due to its symmetry, it is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this result with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers, the final answer is determined as follows.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Principle:** Keto-enol tautomerism, the most common type in this context, requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This is known as an alpha-hydrogen, and its carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has CH₂ groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are alpha to the carbonyl groups. These carbons are sp³ hybridized and possess alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** exhibit tautomerism, readily forming the highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (involving a change in molecular formula), not an isomerization like tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since the four attached groups are different, C-2 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃) is a planar trans-alkene. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Summary:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  **Tautomerism vs. Reduction:** It is crucial to distinguish between tautomerism (an isomerization where the molecular formula is unchanged) and a chemical reaction like reduction. The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂, and is thus a reduction, not tautomerism.\n    2.  **Chirality Requirement:** Optical isomerism is fundamentally about chirality. The presence of a chiral center is the most common indicator, but the ultimate test is whether the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Symmetry elements (like a plane or center of symmetry in dimethyl fumarate) are definitive indicators of an achiral molecule.\n    3.  **Matching to Options:** The final and most critical step is to accurately match the derived conclusions to the given list of options. The correct pairing is A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n*   **Matching with the provided options:**\n    *   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe analysis correctly identifies the pair in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the question into its two core components and analyze each one based on fundamental chemical principles. Then, I will synthesize these two results to determine the correct combination. Finally, I will match this combination with the provided multiple-choice options to select the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism.** The question asks which compound does **not** show tautomerism.\n    *   **Principle:** Keto-enol tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. This carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Has sp³ hybridized carbons with alpha-hydrogens between the carbonyl groups. It readily tautomerizes to form a very stable aromatic enol (phloroglucinol). Therefore, it *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds (sp² hybridized) and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens for this type of tautomerism. Therefore, it does **not** show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The correct compound is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism.** The question asks which compound **will** show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon is bonded to four distinct groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral. Therefore, it *will* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is a planar, achiral molecule with a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it will **not** show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The correct compound is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Match:**\n    *   A = benzoquinone\n    *   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   This combination matches option **B**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function systematically analyzes the chemistry question to determine the correct answer.\n    It first identifies the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and then the one\n    that shows optical isomerism (B).

For a compound to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it is attached to must be sp³ hybridized to allow for the rearrangement into an enol (a C=C double bond with an -OH group).\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is an sp³ hybridized CH₂ group, meaning they possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds; they are sp² hybridized and do not have any attached hydrogens. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (addition of hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

The molecule is chiral and therefore **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this result with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. This is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A key requirement for this process is the presence of at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These carbons are alpha to the carbonyl groups, are sp³ hybridized, and possess alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They lack the required type of alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (the molecular formula changes from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂), not an isomerization like tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Result for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** This property is exhibited by chiral molecules.

The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization, as the molecular formula changes. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** This property is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this result with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Consensus on Part A (Tautomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n*   **Principle:** Keto-enol tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. This carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** All candidate answers correctly identify that this compound has alpha-hydrogens on its sp³ hybridized carbons (the CH₂ groups between the ketones). Therefore, it **does** show tautomerism, forming the highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n*   **Benzoquinone:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are sp² hybridized and part of a double bond system. They lack the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** There is a unanimous and correct consensus among all candidate answers that the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Consensus on Part B (Optical Isomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n*   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** All candidate answers correctly analyze the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃ and identify that the central carbon (C-2) is bonded to four different groups: (-H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as a planar, achiral compound with a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers and therefore **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** There is a unanimous and correct consensus among all candidate answers that the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Answer and Match with Options**\n\nBased on the flawless chemical reasoning present in all candidate answers:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must carefully match this result with the options provided in the question:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct pairing is found in option B.\n\n(Note: Many of the candidate answers selected a different letter because the options presented to them were likely in a different order.

These are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, it **does** show tautomerism, readily forming the stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of C=C double bonds (sp² hybridized) and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** All candidate answers correctly conclude that **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n*   **Question:** Which compound **will** show optical isomerism?\n*   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules.

Therefore, this molecule **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

This is an isomerization reaction that requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized to allow for the formation of the enol's C=C double bond.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each is an sp³ hybridized CH₂ group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This compound has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) is a reduction reaction, not tautomerism, because the molecular formula changes. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to identify which of the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** This property is exhibited by chiral molecules.

For a compound to undergo this type of isomerization, it must possess at least one \"alpha-hydrogen.\" An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is an sp³ hybridized CH₂ group, meaning they possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. These carbons are sp² hybridized and lack the required type of alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon that can easily participate in keto-enol tautomerization. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to its corresponding phenol-like structure, hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂), involves a change in the molecular formula and is a reduction reaction, not a tautomeric equilibrium. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that causes chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since the four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Due to its symmetry, it is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this result with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers, the final answer is determined as follows.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Principle:** Keto-enol tautomerism, the most common type in this context, requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This is known as an alpha-hydrogen, and its carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has CH₂ groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are alpha to the carbonyl groups. These carbons are sp³ hybridized and possess alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** exhibit tautomerism, readily forming the highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** In this molecule, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (involving a change in molecular formula), not an isomerization like tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since the four attached groups are different, C-2 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃) is a planar trans-alkene. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Summary:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  **Tautomerism vs. Reduction:** It is crucial to distinguish between tautomerism (an isomerization where the molecular formula is unchanged) and a chemical reaction like reduction. The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂, and is thus a reduction, not tautomerism.\n    2.  **Chirality Requirement:** Optical isomerism is fundamentally about chirality. The presence of a chiral center is the most common indicator, but the ultimate test is whether the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Symmetry elements (like a plane or center of symmetry in dimethyl fumarate) are definitive indicators of an achiral molecule.\n    3.  **Matching to Options:** The final and most critical step is to accurately match the derived conclusions to the given list of options. The correct pairing is A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n*   **Matching with the provided options:**\n    *   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe analysis correctly identifies the pair in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the question into its two core components and analyze each one based on fundamental chemical principles. Then, I will synthesize these two results to determine the correct combination. Finally, I will match this combination with the provided multiple-choice options to select the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism.** The question asks which compound does **not** show tautomerism.\n    *   **Principle:** Keto-enol tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. This carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Has sp³ hybridized carbons with alpha-hydrogens between the carbonyl groups. It readily tautomerizes to form a very stable aromatic enol (phloroglucinol). Therefore, it *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of C=C double bonds (sp² hybridized) and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens for this type of tautomerism. Therefore, it does **not** show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The correct compound is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism.** The question asks which compound **will** show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon is bonded to four distinct groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral. Therefore, it *will* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is a planar, achiral molecule with a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it will **not** show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The correct compound is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Match:**\n    *   A = benzoquinone\n    *   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   This combination matches option **B**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function systematically analyzes the chemistry question to determine the correct answer.\n    It first identifies the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and then the one\n    that shows optical isomerism (B).

For a compound to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it is attached to must be sp³ hybridized to allow for the rearrangement into an enol (a C=C double bond with an -OH group).\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is an sp³ hybridized CH₂ group, meaning they possess two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds; they are sp² hybridized and do not have any attached hydrogens. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (addition of hydrogen atoms, changing the molecular formula), not an isomerization. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

This is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this result with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. This is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A key requirement for this process is the presence of at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\"—a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These carbons are alpha to the carbonyl groups, are sp³ hybridized, and possess alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They lack the required type of alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon for keto-enol tautomerism.

The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization, as the molecular formula changes. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** This property is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C-2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this result with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Consensus on Part A (Tautomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\n*   **Principle:** Keto-enol tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. This carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** All candidate answers correctly identify that this compound has alpha-hydrogens on its sp³ hybridized carbons (the CH₂ groups between the ketones). Therefore, it **does** show tautomerism, forming the highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n*   **Benzoquinone:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are sp² hybridized and part of a double bond system. They lack the required alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** There is a unanimous and correct consensus among all candidate answers that the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Consensus on Part B (Optical Isomerism)**\n\nThe question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n*   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** All candidate answers correctly analyze the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃ and identify that the central carbon (C-2) is bonded to four different groups: (-H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as a planar, achiral compound with a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers and therefore **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** There is a unanimous and correct consensus among all candidate answers that the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Synthesize the Final Answer and Match with Options**\n\nBased on the flawless chemical reasoning present in all candidate answers:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must carefully match this result with the options provided in the question:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct pairing is found in option B.\n\n(Note: Many of the candidate answers selected a different letter because the options presented to them were likely in a different order.

This is an isomerization reaction that requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized to allow for the formation of the enol's C=C double bond.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each is an sp³ hybridized CH₂ group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its highly stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.

The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) is a reduction reaction, not tautomerism, because the molecular formula changes.
