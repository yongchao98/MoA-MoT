Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern is sterically crowded and requires a careful synthetic strategy. The \"high-yield\" requirement implies that the reactions should be highly regioselective.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Each Option\n\nI will analyze each option based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry to identify any impossible or illogical steps.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly convert benzene to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B: `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   Step (v) forms a diazonium salt from a primary amine.\n    *   Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; the diazonium salt would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    *   The sequence is illogical. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. The product from the preceding step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    *   By elimination, this is the only potentially correct option. Let's verify the pathway. The final two steps (viii, ix) are superfluous as the product is formed by step (vii).\n    1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to steric hindrance. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline in strong acid protonates the amine to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and strategic)\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) Etherification:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or fundamentally flawed step. Option A describes a sequence of valid chemical reactions that successfully leads to the target molecule. Although the yield of the first nitration step (ii) for the required isomer is low, the overall pathway is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound. In a multiple-choice context, the only chemically possible route is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Task\nThe goal is to identify the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. The question specifies that the synthesis should be \"high-yield,\" which is an important clue regarding the regioselectivity of the reactions.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Substituent Properties & Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strong activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** A weak activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. Its significant bulk sterically hinders substitution at the ortho positions, strongly favoring the para position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** A strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Synthetic Strategy:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and often requires a multi-step strategy involving functional group interconversions. A common way to introduce an -OH group (precursor to -OEt) is via a diazonium salt, which is made from a primary amine (-NH₂). This suggests the final steps will likely be:\n    `...-NH₂ → ...-N₂⁺ → ...-OH → ...-OEt`\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\nEach sequence must be evaluated for chemical feasibility. A single impossible reaction or an illogical sequence of steps invalidates the entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), requires a primary amine as a starting material. However, the reduction step that would form the amine (`viii) Fe/HCl`) does not occur until much later. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by converting benzene to aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence proceeds to step (v), where a diazonium salt is formed. Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; the diazonium salt would decompose under these conditions rather than undergo nitration. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's verify its chemical pathway:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. The desired *ortho* isomer is a minor product, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible to obtain via separation.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of the *ortho* isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a plausible and strategic step to create the desired 1,2,3 pattern.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    8.  The final steps, (viii) and (ix), are superfluous as the synthesis is complete, but they do not invalidate the core sequence.\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps. Option C describes a sequence of valid chemical reactions that successfully leads to the target molecule. Although the yield of the initial nitration step for the required isomer is low, it is the only pathway among the choices that is chemically sound and plausible. In a multiple-choice question where other options are impossible, the plausible (even if not perfectly efficient) route is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Goal Definition**\nThe objective is to find the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. This requires a careful evaluation of each proposed synthetic route, paying close attention to the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (directing effects, steric hindrance) and the feasibility of each specific reaction.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric crowding.\n\n**3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\nWe will analyze each option for fatal chemical flaws. A sequence with even one impossible or illogical step is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene into aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate.\n    *   The preceding step (iii) is a sulfonation, which does not produce an amine. The amine-forming reduction step (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii).\n    *   The sequence is chemically illogical.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   Step (v) correctly forms a diazonium salt from an amine.\n    *   Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation; the diazonium salt would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   By elimination, this must be the correct sequence. Let's verify its chemical validity.\n    *   **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n    *   **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The synthesis must proceed with the minor ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). This is chemically possible, even if not high-yield. (Valid)\n    *   **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\n    *   **iv) Nitration:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the meta-directing anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). Both the anilinium and tert-butyl groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. (Valid)\n    *   **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    *   **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Valid)\n    *   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\nOptions A, C, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps. Option B describes a sequence of valid chemical reactions that successfully leads to the target molecule. Although the yield of one intermediate may be low, it is the only chemically plausible pathway among the choices.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze each option for fatal chemical flaws.\n# Option A: Fails at step (iii).

Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3. This is a sterically crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.\n*   **Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards):**\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. A reliable final step is a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reagents for this step would be a base and an ethylating agent (e.g., `NaOH/EtBr`).\n    *   A phenol (-OH) is commonly made from a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) via a diazonium salt. The sequence is: `-NH₂ --(NaNO₂/HCl)--> -N₂⁺ --(H₂O, heat)--> -OH`. This means the precursor to the phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   The core challenge is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. This requires placing a nitro group at C3 of 2-tert-butylaniline.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nWe will analyze each proposed sequence for chemically impossible or illogical steps. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the diazonium salt would likely decompose.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly produce aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (`Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   By elimination, this is the only possible answer. Let's verify the pathway:\n        1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to steric hindrance. While this step is not \"high-yield\" for the desired isomer, it is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Valid reduction).\n        4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *ortho,para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a plausible strategy to form **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n        5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.

Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically valid pathway to the target molecule. Although the yield of step (ii) for the required isomer is low, it is the only chemically possible route among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\nThe objective is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. This requires introducing three substituents onto the benzene ring in a specific 1,2,3- (vicinal) arrangement. A successful synthesis must follow the rules of chemical reactivity, particularly the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution, and must not contain any chemically impossible steps.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\nWe will examine each proposed sequence for fatal flaws, such as impossible reactions or an illogical order of steps.\n\n*   **Option A: `... iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is chemically impossible as written. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. However, the reduction step needed to create the amine (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    This sequence proposes to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates that are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reactions, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration with a strong acid mixture, as they would decompose. This is not a viable synthetic step. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    This sequence begins by correctly forming aniline (steps i and ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring, preventing the desired alkylation reaction. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    This sequence is the only remaining possibility. Let's verify its chemical validity:\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard and valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product, but it is formed and can be carried forward.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho,para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the desired position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: The phenol is converted to the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, via a Williamson ether synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOptions A, B, and C each contain at least one chemically impossible reaction or an illogical sequence of steps. Option D describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. While the \"high-yield\" claim in the question may be debatable due to the formation of isomers in an early step, Option D is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary, focusing on chemical feasibility, regioselectivity, and directing effects of substituents.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and requires careful control of regiochemistry. The \"high-yield\" requirement suggests that each step should be efficient and selective.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Provided Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option as written:\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    This option is chemically illogical. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv: `NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, the necessary amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii: `Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    This sequence proceeds to form a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; the diazonium salt would decompose under these conditions. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence begins by correctly forming aniline from benzene (steps i and ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    This sequence is the only chemically plausible pathway:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To achieve the target structure, the minor *ortho* isomer (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) must be separated and used. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, allowing for the formation of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain fundamentally flawed or impossible chemical steps. Option C describes a valid sequence of reactions that successfully produces the target molecule. Although the yield of the initial nitration step (ii) for the required isomer is low, the overall pathway is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the only chemically possible route is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed option is necessary. The analysis must focus on the chemical feasibility of each reaction, the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring, and steric hindrance.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided candidate answers, there is a clear consensus on the only chemically viable pathway, although the letter designation for that pathway (A, C, or D) varies. The core task is to identify the correct chemical sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Correct Synthetic Pathway\n\nThe only chemically plausible route to the target molecule, as identified by the majority of the analyses, proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`**: The synthesis begins with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to introduce the tert-butyl group, forming **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard and logical first step.\n\n2.  **ii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**: The next step is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to its significant steric bulk, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position. However, the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed as a minor product. To synthesize the final 1,2,3-substituted product, this minor *ortho* isomer must be separated and carried forward. While this step is not high-yield for the required intermediate, it is chemically possible.\n\n3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to a primary amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard and efficient reduction.\n\n4.  **iv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**: This is a key strategic step. The nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline occurs in a strong acidic medium, which protonates the amino group to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of both groups align to place the incoming nitro group at position 3 (which is *meta* to the anilinium ion and *ortho* to the tert-butyl group). This allows for the formation of the required intermediate, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n5.  **v) `NaNO₂/HCl`**: The primary amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n\n6.  **vi) `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: The final step is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by a base (NaOH) and then reacts with an ethylating agent (ethyl bromide) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Analysis of Flawed Pathways\n\nThe other options presented in the problem contain fatal chemical flaws, as correctly identified by the candidate answers:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts on Aniline:** One sequence attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n*   **Incorrect Substrate for Diazotization:** Another sequence attempts to use diazotization reagents (NaNO₂/HCl) on a substrate that is not a primary amine.\n*   **Nitration of a Diazonium Salt:** A third sequence attempts to nitrate a highly unstable diazonium salt, which is not a viable synthetic transformation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence detailed above is the only chemically plausible pathway among the choices that leads to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim is questionable due to the formation of isomers in the first nitration step, the other options are chemically impossible and would have a zero yield. Therefore, this sequence is the correct answer.\n\nBased on the candidate answers, there is confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to this correct sequence. However, the majority of the analyses (8 out of 15) assign the letter **A** to this valid pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. The analysis must focus on the feasibility of each reaction and the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring at each stage.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern is sterically crowded and requires a precise synthetic strategy to control the regiochemistry. The \"high-yield\" requirement suggests that the steps should be highly selective.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nWe will evaluate each option for chemical validity. A sequence containing a chemically impossible or illogical step can be eliminated.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ... iv) NaNO₂/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine as the starting material. However, the reduction step needed to form the amine (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    In this sequence, step (v) correctly performs a diazotization on an amine formed in a previous step. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to a phenol), not as substrates for electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. This is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    By elimination, this is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze the pathway to confirm its validity:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group. While this step is not high-yield for the required isomer, the reaction is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions, including the desired position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and known strategy.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The final steps, (viii) and (ix), are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed, but they do not invalidate the core chemical pathway.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or fundamentally flawed step. Option A, despite having a step with poor regioselectivity that contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim, represents the only chemically plausible sequence that leads to the correctly named target molecule. In the context of selecting the best option from the given choices, a low-yield step is a less severe error than an impossible reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must systematically evaluate each proposed reaction sequence for chemical feasibility, paying close attention to the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (directing effects, activation/deactivation) and the specific reactions involved.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: -OEt at position 1, -tBu at position 2, and -NO₂ at position 3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring is often difficult due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.

Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   The bulky tert-butyl group strongly favors substitution at the *para* position, making *ortho* substitution difficult.\n    *   The final steps often involve converting an amine to other functional groups via a diazonium salt.\n\n### 2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)\nA common and reliable strategy for synthesizing aryl ethers (-OEt) is the Williamson ether synthesis. This suggests the final step is the reaction of a phenol with a base and an ethyl halide.\n*   **Final Step:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`.

This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted or \"vicinal\" pattern.\n*   Such patterns are often difficult to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   A common strategy for introducing the -OEt group is a Williamson ether synthesis as the final step, which means the immediate precursor would be the corresponding phenol: 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n*   A phenol is often made from a primary amine via diazotization and hydrolysis. This suggests the precursor to the phenol is 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline.\n*   Therefore, the core of the synthesis is creating the intermediate **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n**3.

Let's verify the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. This step produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired ortho isomer is the minor product, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim, but the reaction is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine → 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Second Nitration:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the -NH₃⁺ group (a meta-director). The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the key intermediate **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid strategy)\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.

(Valid)\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps. Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the yield of some steps would be low (conflicting with the \"high-yield\" prompt), it is the only viable route among the choices. In multiple-choice questions of this type, the chemically possible route is the intended correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary. The analysis must focus on reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (the position of substitution), and steric effects.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and difficult to achieve.\n    *   The bulky tert-butyl group strongly favors substitution at the *para* position, making substitution at the adjacent *ortho* position a low-yield process.\n    *   The final steps often involve converting a versatile functional group, like an amino group (-NH₂), into the desired substituent. An amino group can be converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH) via a diazonium salt, which can then be converted to an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nWe will analyze each option for fatal chemical flaws. A sequence with even one impossible step is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by converting benzene to aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails when performed on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a positively charged complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    **Conclusion: Option A is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    In this sequence, a diazonium salt is formed in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the diazonium salt would decompose under these conditions.\n    **Conclusion: Option B is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is nonsensically ordered. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. However, the preceding steps do not form an amine; the reduction step (`Fe/HCl`) is not until step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not present.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This sequence is the only remaining possibility. Let's verify its chemical validity:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to steric hindrance. While this step is not \"high-yield,\" it is chemically possible, and the isomer can be separated.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group with Fe/HCl, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline in strong acid protonates the amine to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). This ion is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and effective strategy.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. This is a standard reaction.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is treated with a base (NaOH) and an ethylating agent (EtBr) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a standard ether synthesis.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe pathways described in options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible or illogical steps. The sequence in Option D is the only one that is chemically plausible from start to finish. Although the \"high-yield\" claim is questionable due to the formation of an isomeric mixture in step (ii), it is the only correct choice among the given options because the others are fundamentally flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** The ethoxy group is an ether, which is most reliably made in a final step via a Williamson ether synthesis. This means the immediate precursor is a phenol.\n    *   `Product` <-- `NaOH/EtBr` <-- `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n*   A phenol is commonly synthesized from a primary aromatic amine via a diazonium salt.\n    *   `Phenol` <-- `H₃O⁺/Heat` <-- `Diazonium Salt` <-- `NaNO₂/HCl` <-- `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline`\n*   This means the core of the synthesis is to create the key intermediate: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nThe provided candidate answers show significant confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to which sequence. However, there is a strong consensus on which sequence is chemically plausible and which three contain fatal flaws. We will analyze the sequences based on their chemical content.\n\n#### Flawed Sequences (Chemically Impossible)\n\nThree of the proposed synthetic routes contain steps that are fundamentally incorrect in organic chemistry.\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on Aniline:** One sequence involves creating aniline first (`i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl`) and then attempting to add a tert-butyl group (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Any option containing this sequence is incorrect.\n2.  **Diazotization of a Non-Amine:** Another sequence attempts to use diazotization reagents (`NaNO₂/HCl`) on a substrate that is not a primary aromatic amine (e.g., on a sulfonic acid). This reaction is only valid for converting a primary aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. Any option with this error is incorrect.\n3.  **Nitration of a Diazonium Salt:** A third flawed sequence involves creating a diazonium salt and then attempting to nitrate it (`vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. Any option containing this step is incorrect.\n\n#### The Plausible Sequence\n\nBy elimination, only one sequence of reactions is chemically viable, even if it has practical limitations. The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers identify the following pathway as the only correct one:\n\n*   **Step i: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`**\n    *   Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid first step.\n*   **Step ii: `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**\n    *   Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* product is major. However, the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (*ortho* isomer) is also formed and must be separated and carried forward. This step is chemically possible, but it contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim of the question.\n*   **Step iii: `Fe/HCl`**\n    *   The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n*   **Step iv: `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**\n    *   Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This forms the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   **Step v: `NaNO₂/HCl`**\n    *   The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization.\n*   **Step vi: `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`**\n    *   The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **Step vii: `NaOH/EtBr`**\n    *   A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDespite the low yield of the ortho-nitration step, this sequence is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound and leads to the target molecule. The other three options contain fatal flaws (impossible reactions). In a multiple-choice question, the chemically possible route must be selected over the impossible ones. The majority of the provided answers (8 out of 15) label this correct sequence as option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary. The analysis must focus on reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (the directing effects of substituents), and potential steric hindrance.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and difficult to achieve.\n    *   The synthesis must correctly place a bulky tert-butyl group next to two other substituents.\n    *   The \"high-yield\" requirement implies that the reactions should be highly selective.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nWe will evaluate each option for chemical validity. A sequence containing a chemically impossible step can be immediately eliminated.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    *   This option has typos and an illogical order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The preceding steps do not form an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is chemically illogical and incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly forms a diazonium salt in step (v). However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; the salt would decompose.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   By elimination, this is the only potentially correct option. Let's verify its chemical pathway. The final two steps (viii, ix) are superfluous as the target is formed by step (vii).\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. However, the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (*ortho* isomer) is also formed and must be separated to continue. This step is chemically possible, although it contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the desired position C3 (which is *meta* to the anilinium and *ortho* to the tert-butyl). This forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion: The sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct target molecule.**\n\n### Final Decision\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps and must be discarded. Option A describes the only chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. While the yield of the first nitration step (ii) for the required intermediate is low, the overall sequence is the only one among the choices that is chemically valid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1.

In a multiple-choice context, the only chemically possible route is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Task\nThe goal is to identify the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. The question specifies that the synthesis should be \"high-yield,\" which is an important clue regarding the regioselectivity of the reactions.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Substituent Properties & Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strong activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** A weak activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. Its significant bulk sterically hinders substitution at the ortho positions, strongly favoring the para position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** A strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Synthetic Strategy:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and often requires a multi-step strategy involving functional group interconversions. A common way to introduce an -OH group (precursor to -OEt) is via a diazonium salt, which is made from a primary amine (-NH₂). This suggests the final steps will likely be:\n    `...-NH₂ → ...-N₂⁺ → ...-OH → ...-OEt`\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\nEach sequence must be evaluated for chemical feasibility. A single impossible reaction or an illogical sequence of steps invalidates the entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), requires a primary amine as a starting material. However, the reduction step that would form the amine (`viii) Fe/HCl`) does not occur until much later. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by converting benzene to aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence proceeds to step (v), where a diazonium salt is formed. Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; the diazonium salt would decompose under these conditions rather than undergo nitration. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's verify its chemical pathway:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. The desired *ortho* isomer is a minor product, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible to obtain via separation.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of the *ortho* isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This is a plausible and strategic step to create the desired 1,2,3 pattern.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    8.  The final steps, (viii) and (ix), are superfluous as the synthesis is complete, but they do not invalidate the core sequence.\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps. Option C describes a sequence of valid chemical reactions that successfully leads to the target molecule. Although the yield of the initial nitration step for the required isomer is low, it is the only pathway among the choices that is chemically sound and plausible. In a multiple-choice question where other options are impossible, the plausible (even if not perfectly efficient) route is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Goal Definition**\nThe objective is to find the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. This requires a careful evaluation of each proposed synthetic route, paying close attention to the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (directing effects, steric hindrance) and the feasibility of each specific reaction.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric crowding.\n\n**3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\nWe will analyze each option for fatal chemical flaws. A sequence with even one impossible or illogical step is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene into aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.

The amine-forming reduction step (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii).\n    *   The sequence is chemically illogical.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   Step (v) correctly forms a diazonium salt from an amine.\n    *   Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation; the diazonium salt would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   By elimination, this must be the correct sequence. Let's verify its chemical validity.\n    *   **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n    *   **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The synthesis must proceed with the minor ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene).

Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3. This is a sterically crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.\n*   **Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards):**\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. A reliable final step is a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reagents for this step would be a base and an ethylating agent (e.g., `NaOH/EtBr`).\n    *   A phenol (-OH) is commonly made from a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) via a diazonium salt. The sequence is: `-NH₂ --(NaNO₂/HCl)--> -N₂⁺ --(H₂O, heat)--> -OH`. This means the precursor to the phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   The core challenge is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.

Let's verify the pathway:\n        1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers.

Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\nThe objective is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. This requires introducing three substituents onto the benzene ring in a specific 1,2,3- (vicinal) arrangement. A successful synthesis must follow the rules of chemical reactivity, particularly the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution, and must not contain any chemically impossible steps.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\nWe will examine each proposed sequence for fatal flaws, such as impossible reactions or an illogical order of steps.\n\n*   **Option A: `... iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is chemically impossible as written. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. However, the reduction step needed to create the amine (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    This sequence proposes to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates that are used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reactions, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration with a strong acid mixture, as they would decompose. This is not a viable synthetic step. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    This sequence begins by correctly forming aniline (steps i and ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring, preventing the desired alkylation reaction. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    This sequence is the only remaining possibility. Let's verify its chemical validity:\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard and valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers.

The tert-butyl group is an *ortho,para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the desired position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: The phenol is converted to the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, via a Williamson ether synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOptions A, B, and C each contain at least one chemically impossible reaction or an illogical sequence of steps. Option D describes a sequence of reactions that is entirely chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule.

Option C describes a valid sequence of reactions that successfully produces the target molecule. Although the yield of the initial nitration step (ii) for the required isomer is low, the overall pathway is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the only chemically possible route is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed option is necessary. The analysis must focus on the chemical feasibility of each reaction, the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring, and steric hindrance.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided candidate answers, there is a clear consensus on the only chemically viable pathway, although the letter designation for that pathway (A, C, or D) varies. The core task is to identify the correct chemical sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Correct Synthetic Pathway\n\nThe only chemically plausible route to the target molecule, as identified by the majority of the analyses, proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`**: The synthesis begins with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to introduce the tert-butyl group, forming **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard and logical first step.\n\n2.  **ii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**: The next step is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to its significant steric bulk, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position. However, the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed as a minor product. To synthesize the final 1,2,3-substituted product, this minor *ortho* isomer must be separated and carried forward. While this step is not high-yield for the required intermediate, it is chemically possible.\n\n3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to a primary amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard and efficient reduction.\n\n4.  **iv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**: This is a key strategic step. The nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline occurs in a strong acidic medium, which protonates the amino group to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of both groups align to place the incoming nitro group at position 3 (which is *meta* to the anilinium ion and *ortho* to the tert-butyl group). This allows for the formation of the required intermediate, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n5.  **v) `NaNO₂/HCl`**: The primary amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n\n6.  **vi) `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: The final step is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by a base (NaOH) and then reacts with an ethylating agent (ethyl bromide) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Analysis of Flawed Pathways\n\nThe other options presented in the problem contain fatal chemical flaws, as correctly identified by the candidate answers:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts on Aniline:** One sequence attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n*   **Incorrect Substrate for Diazotization:** Another sequence attempts to use diazotization reagents (NaNO₂/HCl) on a substrate that is not a primary amine.\n*   **Nitration of a Diazonium Salt:** A third sequence attempts to nitrate a highly unstable diazonium salt, which is not a viable synthetic transformation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence detailed above is the only chemically plausible pathway among the choices that leads to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim is questionable due to the formation of isomers in the first nitration step, the other options are chemically impossible and would have a zero yield. Therefore, this sequence is the correct answer.\n\nBased on the candidate answers, there is confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to this correct sequence. However, the majority of the analyses (8 out of 15) assign the letter **A** to this valid pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis of each option is required. The analysis must focus on the feasibility of each reaction and the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring at each stage.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern is sterically crowded and requires a precise synthetic strategy to control the regiochemistry. The \"high-yield\" requirement suggests that the steps should be highly selective.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nWe will evaluate each option for chemical validity. A sequence containing a chemically impossible or illogical step can be eliminated.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ... iv) NaNO₂/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine as the starting material. However, the reduction step needed to form the amine (`Fe/HCl`) does not occur until step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    In this sequence, step (v) correctly performs a diazotization on an amine formed in a previous step. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to a phenol), not as substrates for electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. This is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    By elimination, this is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze the pathway to confirm its validity:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group. While this step is not high-yield for the required isomer, the reaction is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions, including the desired position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and known strategy.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The final steps, (viii) and (ix), are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed, but they do not invalidate the core chemical pathway.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or fundamentally flawed step. Option A, despite having a step with poor regioselectivity that contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim, represents the only chemically plausible sequence that leads to the correctly named target molecule. In the context of selecting the best option from the given choices, a low-yield step is a less severe error than an impossible reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must systematically evaluate each proposed reaction sequence for chemical feasibility, paying close attention to the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (directing effects, activation/deactivation) and the specific reactions involved.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: -OEt at position 1, -tBu at position 2, and -NO₂ at position 3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring is often difficult due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.

Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Goal:** Synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Constraint:** The sequence should be \"high-yield\". This is an important clue, but in multiple-choice questions, a chemically possible but low-yield route is often the correct answer if all other options are chemically impossible.\n*   **Target Molecule Analysis:** The product has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: -OEt, -tBu, and -NO2.

(Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** This is a key strategic step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺).

Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   The bulky tert-butyl group strongly favors substitution at the *para* position, making *ortho* substitution difficult.\n    *   The final steps often involve converting an amine to other functional groups via a diazonium salt.\n\n### 2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)\nA common and reliable strategy for synthesizing aryl ethers (-OEt) is the Williamson ether synthesis. This suggests the final step is the reaction of a phenol with a base and an ethyl halide.\n*   **Final Step:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`.

Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\nWe will now evaluate each option as written in the prompt to check for chemical feasibility. A single impossible or illogical step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `...v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v).

This step is not a viable synthetic transformation. **Therefore, Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `...iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl...`\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) with Fe/HCl.

Options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps or illogical sequences. While the yield of the first nitration step in Option D may be debated, it is the only sequence among the choices that is chemically viable.

Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure**\n\n*   The molecule has three adjacent substituents: -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), and -NO₂ (nitro). This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted or \"vicinal\" pattern.\n*   Such patterns are often difficult to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   A common strategy for introducing the -OEt group is a Williamson ether synthesis as the final step, which means the immediate precursor would be the corresponding phenol: 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n*   A phenol is often made from a primary amine via diazotization and hydrolysis. This suggests the precursor to the phenol is 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline.\n*   Therefore, the core of the synthesis is creating the intermediate **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n**3.

The analysis must focus on reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (the position of substitution), and steric effects.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and difficult to achieve.\n    *   The bulky tert-butyl group strongly favors substitution at the *para* position, making substitution at the adjacent *ortho* position a low-yield process.\n    *   The final steps often involve converting a versatile functional group, like an amino group (-NH₂), into the desired substituent. An amino group can be converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH) via a diazonium salt, which can then be converted to an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nWe will analyze each option for fatal chemical flaws. A sequence with even one impossible step is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by converting benzene to aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails when performed on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a positively charged complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    **Conclusion: Option A is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    In this sequence, a diazonium salt is formed in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the diazonium salt would decompose under these conditions.\n    **Conclusion: Option B is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is nonsensically ordered. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. However, the preceding steps do not form an amine; the reduction step (`Fe/HCl`) is not until step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not present.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is chemically incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This sequence is the only remaining possibility. Let's verify its chemical validity:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** is the minor product due to steric hindrance. While this step is not \"high-yield,\" it is chemically possible, and the isomer can be separated.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group with Fe/HCl, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline in strong acid protonates the amine to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). This ion is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a valid and effective strategy.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`. This is a standard reaction.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is a standard reaction.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is treated with a base (NaOH) and an ethylating agent (EtBr) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is a standard ether synthesis.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe pathways described in options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible or illogical steps. The sequence in Option D is the only one that is chemically plausible from start to finish. Although the \"high-yield\" claim is questionable due to the formation of an isomeric mixture in step (ii), it is the only correct choice among the given options because the others are fundamentally flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** The ethoxy group is an ether, which is most reliably made in a final step via a Williamson ether synthesis. This means the immediate precursor is a phenol.\n    *   `Product` <-- `NaOH/EtBr` <-- `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n*   A phenol is commonly synthesized from a primary aromatic amine via a diazonium salt.\n    *   `Phenol` <-- `H₃O⁺/Heat` <-- `Diazonium Salt` <-- `NaNO₂/HCl` <-- `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline`\n*   This means the core of the synthesis is to create the key intermediate: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nThe provided candidate answers show significant confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to which sequence. However, there is a strong consensus on which sequence is chemically plausible and which three contain fatal flaws. We will analyze the sequences based on their chemical content.\n\n#### Flawed Sequences (Chemically Impossible)\n\nThree of the proposed synthetic routes contain steps that are fundamentally incorrect in organic chemistry.\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on Aniline:** One sequence involves creating aniline first (`i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl`) and then attempting to add a tert-butyl group (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Any option containing this sequence is incorrect.\n2.  **Diazotization of a Non-Amine:** Another sequence attempts to use diazotization reagents (`NaNO₂/HCl`) on a substrate that is not a primary aromatic amine (e.g., on a sulfonic acid). This reaction is only valid for converting a primary aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. Any option with this error is incorrect.\n3.  **Nitration of a Diazonium Salt:** A third flawed sequence involves creating a diazonium salt and then attempting to nitrate it (`vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. Any option containing this step is incorrect.\n\n#### The Plausible Sequence\n\nBy elimination, only one sequence of reactions is chemically viable, even if it has practical limitations. The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers identify the following pathway as the only correct one:\n\n*   **Step i: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`**\n    *   Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid first step.\n*   **Step ii: `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**\n    *   Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* product is major. However, the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (*ortho* isomer) is also formed and must be separated and carried forward. This step is chemically possible, but it contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim of the question.\n*   **Step iii: `Fe/HCl`**\n    *   The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n*   **Step iv: `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`**\n    *   Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This forms the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   **Step v: `NaNO₂/HCl`**\n    *   The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization.\n*   **Step vi: `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`**\n    *   The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **Step vii: `NaOH/EtBr`**\n    *   A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDespite the low yield of the ortho-nitration step, this sequence is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound and leads to the target molecule. The other three options contain fatal flaws (impossible reactions). In a multiple-choice question, the chemically possible route must be selected over the impossible ones. The majority of the provided answers (8 out of 15) label this correct sequence as option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary. The analysis must focus on reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (the directing effects of substituents), and potential steric hindrance.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and difficult to achieve.\n    *   The synthesis must correctly place a bulky tert-butyl group next to two other substituents.\n    *   The \"high-yield\" requirement implies that the reactions should be highly selective.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nWe will evaluate each option for chemical validity. A sequence containing a chemically impossible step can be immediately eliminated.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`\n    *   This option has typos and an illogical order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The preceding steps do not form an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is chemically illogical and incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly forms a diazonium salt in step (v). However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; the salt would decompose.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   By elimination, this is the only potentially correct option. Let's verify its chemical pathway. The final two steps (viii, ix) are superfluous as the target is formed by step (vii).\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a valid reaction.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. However, the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (*ortho* isomer) is also formed and must be separated to continue. This step is chemically possible, although it contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the desired position C3 (which is *meta* to the anilinium and *ortho* to the tert-butyl). This forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion: The sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct target molecule.**\n\n### Final Decision\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps and must be discarded. Option A describes the only chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. While the yield of the first nitration step (ii) for the required intermediate is low, the overall sequence is the only one among the choices that is chemically valid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
