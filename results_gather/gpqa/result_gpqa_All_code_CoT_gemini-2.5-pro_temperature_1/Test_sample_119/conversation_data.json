    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Key Concepts**\n*   **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume (number density, ρ) is constant throughout space.\n*   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. Mathematically, `plx = 1/d`. Therefore, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n**2. Relate the Number of Stars to Distance**\n*   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and a very small thickness `dd`.\n*   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n*   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n\n**3. Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax**\n*   Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), so we need to rewrite the equation for `dN` using `plx` instead of `d`.\n*   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * dd`\n*   Next, we need to relate the thickness `dd` to the change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`\n*   So, `dd = (-1/plx^2) * d(plx)`. When we consider the number of stars in a range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases). We use `dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n*   Now, substitute this expression for `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * [(1/plx^2) * d(plx)]`\n*   Simplifying this gives:\n    `dN = (ρ * 4 * π / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n**4. Find the Final Relationship**\n*   The quantity we are looking for is \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is `dN / d(plx)`.\n*   From our final equation, we can see:\n    `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π / plx^4`\n*   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we find that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A. The following Python code will print out the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Let's outline the derivation steps to find the relationship.\n\n# Step 1: Define the fundamental relationships.\n# N = number of stars, V = volume, rho = density of stars (constant)\n# d = distance, plx = parallax\n# The number of stars is proportional to the volume: N ~ V\n# The density rho is constant: dN/dV = rho\n\n# The volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)*pi*d^3\n# The number of stars within a distance d is N(d) = rho * (4/3)*pi*d^3\n\n# The number of stars dN in a thin spherical shell between d and d+dd is:\n# dN = N(d+dd) - N(d) which is approximately (dN/dd)*dd\n# dN/dd = rho * 4*pi*d^2\n# So, dN = rho * 4*pi*d^2 * dd\n\n# Step 2: Relate distance 'd' and parallax 'plx'.\n# plx = 1/d  =>  d = 1/plx\n\n# Step 3: Relate the differential elements 'dd' and 'd(plx)'.\n# d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2\n# So, dd = (-1/plx^2) * d(plx)\n# Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude.\n# |dd| = (1/plx^2) * |d(plx)|\n\n# Step 4: Substitute 'd' and 'dd' in the expression for dN.\n# We want to find the number of stars per unit parallax, which is dN/d(plx).\n# dN = rho * 4*pi * d^2 * dd\n# Substitute d = 1/plx:\n# dN = rho * 4*pi * (1/plx)^2 * dd\n# Substitute dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx):\n# dN = rho * 4*pi * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)\n# dN = (rho * 4*pi / plx^4) * d(plx)\n\n# Step 5: Find the number of stars per unit parallax range, dN/d(plx).\n# dN/d(plx) = rho * 4*pi / plx^4\n\n# Step 6: Conclude the proportionality.\n# Since rho, 4, and pi are constants, dN/d(plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.\nresult = \"1/plx^4\"\nchoice = \"A\"\n\nprint(f\"Assuming a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) is proportional to: {result}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to choice: {choice}\")\n<<<A>>>\n```"
