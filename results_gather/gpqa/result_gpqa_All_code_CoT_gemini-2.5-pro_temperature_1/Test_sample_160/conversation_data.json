    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n2.  **Identify the Scenarios:**\n    *   **λ1 (Gas-Gas):** This is the MFP of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. The moving particle and the target particle are both gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2 (Electron-Gas):** This is the MFP of an electron from the beam colliding with gas molecules. The moving particle is an electron, and the target is a gas molecule.\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):** The number density 'n' of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on their respective collision cross-sections.\n    *   **σ1 (for λ1):** For a collision between two similar gas molecules of diameter 'd', the effective target area is for their centers to come within a distance 'd' of each other. Thus, the cross-section is approximately σ1 ≈ πd². A more precise calculation for identical moving particles introduces a factor of √2, so λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²).\n    *   **σ2 (for λ2):** For a collision between a point-like particle (an electron) and a gas molecule of diameter 'd' (radius r = d/2), the effective target area is simply the cross-sectional area of the gas molecule itself. Thus, σ2 = πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4. Here, we can treat the gas molecules as stationary because the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds.\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio λ2/λ1:**\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (n * σ1)] = σ1 / σ2.\n    *   Using the more precise formula for λ1: λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * π * d²) / (n * π * r²) = (√2 * π * d²) / (π * (d/2)²) = (√2 * π * d²) / (π * d² / 4) = 4√2.\n    *   The value of 4√2 is approximately 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n5.  **Draw a Conclusion:** The calculation shows that λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1. This means the mean free path for an electron is significantly longer than for a gas molecule under the same conditions.\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: False.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: False.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: True, since 5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: False.\n\nThe logical conclusion is that an electron, being much smaller than a gas molecule, has a smaller collision cross-section and therefore a longer mean free path.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_microscope_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the relationship between the mean free path of gas molecules (λ1)\n    and the mean free path of electrons colliding with those molecules (λ2).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the Mean Free Path (MFP) formula.\")\n    print(\"The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ): λ ∝ 1/σ.\")\n    print(\"This means a smaller particle (smaller σ) will have a longer mean free path.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Compare the colliding particles.\")\n    print(\"For λ1, a gas molecule collides with another gas molecule.\")\n    print(\"For λ2, a tiny electron collides with a much larger gas molecule.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Compare the collision cross-sections (σ).\")\n    print(\"Let the diameter of a gas molecule be 'd'.\")\n    # Collision cross-section for two gas molecules (σ1) is roughly the area of a circle with diameter 2d,\n    # but the key is that two large objects are colliding.\n    # More accurately, σ1 for gas-gas collisions is proportional to πd².\n    # σ1 is related to two molecules of diameter 'd' colliding.\n    # A more precise formula gives λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * π * d^2)\n    print(\"The collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions (σ1) is proportional to the square of the gas molecule's diameter (d^2).\")\n\n    # Collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (σ2) is the area of the molecule itself.\n    # σ2 is related to a point-like electron hitting a molecule of radius r = d/2.\n    # So, σ2 = πr^2 = π(d/2)^2 = (πd^2)/4.\n    print(\"The collision cross-section for electron-gas collisions (σ2) is proportional to the square of the gas molecule's radius (r^2 = (d/2)^2), because the electron's size is negligible.\")\n    print(f\"This means σ1 is significantly larger than σ2.
