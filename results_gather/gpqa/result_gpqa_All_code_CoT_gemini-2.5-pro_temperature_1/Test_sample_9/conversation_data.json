    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between a rocky planet's mass and its density. Density is mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a simple, non-compressible object, if you double the mass while keeping the composition the same, the volume would also double, and the density would remain constant. However, planets are massive enough to be significantly compressed by their own gravity. This effect is called self-gravitational compression.\n2.  **Mass-Density Relationship:** For a planet with the same composition (e.g., a mix of rock and iron like Earth), a more massive planet will have stronger gravity, causing it to compress more. This compression reduces its volume more than would be expected otherwise, leading to a higher overall density. Conversely, a less massive planet will be less compressed and thus less dense.\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline. Its density is Earth's density, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is about the same as Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Because it is much more massive than Earth, its self-gravitational compression will be significantly greater. Therefore, its density must be higher than Earth's density.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Because it is less massive than Earth, it will be less compressed by its own gravity. Therefore, its density must be lower than Earth's density.\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the options, the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) will be the most compressed and therefore the densest. The planets in options (a) and (b) have a density of ~5.5 g/cm³, and the planet in (d) will be even less dense.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and compares the estimated densities to confirm this conclusion. It uses the scientific mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which states that Radius is proportional to Mass to the power of approximately 1/3.7 (`R ∝ M^(1/3.7)`).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_densities():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the densities of the four exoplanet options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the baseline density of Earth in g/cm^3\n    earth_density = 5.51\n\n    # --- Density Calculations ---\n\n    # a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\n    # By definition, its density is Earth's density.\n    density_a = earth_density\n\n    # b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\n    # The density is given in the problem statement.\n    density_b = 5.5\n\n    # c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive.\n    # For rocky planets, R ∝ M^(1/k) where k is approx 3.7.\n    # Density ρ = M/V ∝ M/R^3.\n    # So, ρ_new / ρ_old = (M_new/M_old) / (R_new/R_old)^3\n    # ρ_new = ρ_old * (M_ratio) / (M_ratio^(1/3.7))^3\n    # ρ_new = ρ_old * M_ratio^(1 - 3/3.7)\n    mass_ratio_c = 5.0\n    exponent = 1 - (3 / 3.7)\n    density_c = earth_density * (mass_ratio_c ** exponent)\n\n    # d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\n    # We use the same relationship as in (c).\n    mass_ratio_d = 0.5\n    density_d = earth_density * (mass_ratio_d ** exponent)\n\n    # --- Output Results ---\n    print(\"Estimated densities for each exoplanet:\")\n    print(f\"a) An Earth-like planet: {density_a:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n    print(f\"b) A 2-Earth-mass planet with given density: {density_b:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n    print(f\"c) A 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth composition: {density_c:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n    print(f\"d) A 0.5-Earth-mass planet with Earth composition: {density_d:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n\n    # Find the highest density\n    densities = {'a': density_a, 'b': density_b, 'c': density_c, 'd': density_d}\n    highest_density_option = max(densities, key=densities.get)\n\n    # Map the planet option to the multiple-choice letter\n    # A) d, B) b, C) c, D) a\n    final_answer_map = {'a': 'D', 'b': 'B', 'c': 'C', 'd': 'A'}\n    final_answer = final_answer_map[highest_density_option]\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe planet with the highest density is option '{highest_density_option}'.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to choice {final_answer}.\")\n    \n    # Return the final letter choice for the user\n    return final_answer\n\n# Execute the function and print the final answer in the required format\nfinal_choice = calculate_densities()\n# The final print is not strictly needed by the problem description,\n# but it's good practice to show the final result clearly.\n# print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {final_choice}\")\n# The problem asks to directly return the answer in the format <<<answer content>>> at the end.\n# So we will print the choice within the function and then again here in the requested format.\n# Let's just call the function.
