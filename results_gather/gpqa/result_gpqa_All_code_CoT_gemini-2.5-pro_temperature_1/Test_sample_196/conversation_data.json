    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:** I will interpret the key peaks in the Infrared (IR) spectrum to identify the functional groups present in Compound X.\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** I will interpret the chemical shifts, integration values, and splitting patterns in the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectrum to determine the structure of the carbon skeleton and the placement of the functional groups.\n3.  **Identify Compound X:** By combining the information from both spectra, I will deduce the complete structure of the starting material, Compound X, and match it to the provided options.\n4.  **Identify the Reaction:** I will identify the type of reaction that occurs with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This is a well-known, powerful reduction reaction.\n5.  **Predict the Final Product:** I will apply the transformation from the identified reaction to the structure of Compound X to determine the structure of the final product.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option:** I will compare the predicted final product with the given choices (A, B, C, D) to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemical identification problem step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze spectra to identify Compound X\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the spectral data to identify the starting material (Compound X).\")\n    print(\" - IR spectrum:\")\n    print(\"   - A very broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1 is characteristic of an O-H bond in a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"   - A strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is characteristic of a C=O bond, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"   - Peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 suggest an aromatic ring.\")\n    print(\" - 1H NMR spectrum:\")\n    print(\"   - A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\")\n    print(\"   - Two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\")\n    print(\"   - The remaining signals describe the alkyl side chain: a sec-butyl group.\")\n    print(\"     - 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): The CH proton attached to the benzene ring.\")\n    print(\"     - 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): The CH2 group of the sec-butyl chain.\")\n    print(\"     - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): The CH3 group attached to the benzylic CH.\")\n    print(\"     - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): The terminal CH3 group of the sec-butyl chain.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion for Step 1: Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.
