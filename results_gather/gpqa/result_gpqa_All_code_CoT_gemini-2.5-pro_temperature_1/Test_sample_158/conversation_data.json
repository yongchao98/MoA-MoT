    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Feature:** The problem describes a peak in a quasar's spectrum at 790 nm with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This is a characteristic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift object. The drop is caused by the absorption from the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (the Lyα forest and Gunn-Peterson trough). We will assume the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyα line is λ_rest = 121.6 nm.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The redshift `z` can be calculated from the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) using the formula:\n    `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Comoving Distance (D_C):** For a flat ΛCDM universe, as specified in the problem (Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1.0), the comoving distance to an object at redshift `z` is given by the integral:\n    `D_C = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')`\n    where:\n    *   `D_H = c / H₀` is the Hubble distance.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `H₀` is the Hubble constant.\n    *   `E(z') = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z')³ + Ω_Λ)` is the evolution parameter for a flat universe.\n\n4.  **Execute with Python:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n    *   Define the given cosmological and physical constants.\n    *   Calculate the redshift `z`.\n    *   Use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically solve the integral for the comoving distance.\n    *   Compute the final distance in Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n    *   Compare the calculated distance with the provided options (A, B, C, D) to find the best fit.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_quasar_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the comoving distance to a quasar based on its observed\n    Lyman-alpha peak and a given cosmological model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants and observed values ---\n\n    # Cosmological parameters from the Lambda-CDM model\n    H0 = 70.0        # Hubble constant in km s^-1 Mpc^-1\n    Omega_m = 0.3    # Matter density parameter\n    Omega_L = 0.7    # Dark energy density parameter\n\n    # Physical constants and observations\n    c = 299792.458   # Speed of light in km/s\n    lambda_obs = 790.0 # Observed wavelength of the peak in nm\n    lambda_rest_lya = 121.6 # Rest-frame wavelength of Lyman-alpha in nm\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the redshift (z) ---\n    # The redshift is determined from the shift in the Lyman-alpha line.\n    z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest_lya) - 1\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the Comoving Distance ---\n\n    # The integrand for the comoving distance integral in a flat universe.\n    def integrand(z_prime):\n        return 1.0 / np.sqrt(Omega_m * (1 + z_prime)**3 + Omega_L)\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration from z'=0 to z.\n    # quad() returns the integral result and an error estimate.\n    integral_result, _ = quad(integrand, 0, z)\n\n    # Calculate the Hubble distance in Mpc.\n    D_H = c / H0\n\n    # Calculate the comoving distance in Mpc.\n    Dc_Mpc = D_H * integral_result\n\n    # Convert the distance to Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n    Dc_Gpc = Dc_Mpc / 1000.0\n\n    # --- Step 4: Compare with options and print the result ---\n    print(f\"Based on the observations and the cosmological model:\")\n    print(f\"The calculated redshift (z) is: {z:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"The calculated comoving distance is: {Dc_Gpc:.2f} Gpc\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    options = {'A': 6, 'B': 8, 'C': 9, 'D': 7}\n    print(\"Comparing the result to the given options:\")\n    print(f\"A) {options['A']} Gpc\")\n    print(f\"B) {options['B']} Gpc\")\n    print(f\"C) {options['C']} Gpc\")\n    print(f\"D) {options['D']} Gpc\")\n    \n    # Find the option with the minimum absolute difference from the calculated value.\n    closest_option_key = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - Dc_Gpc))\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The calculated value of {Dc_Gpc:.2f} Gpc is closest to option {closest_option_key}: {options[closest_option_key]} Gpc.\")\n    \n# Execute the function to print the solution.\nsolve_quasar_distance()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
