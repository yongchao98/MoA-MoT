    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the spin operator $S_y$ for the given spin state.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Represent the quantum state and operator:**\n    *   The spin state is given as a column vector (spinor): $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The spin operator in the y-direction is $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y$, where $\\sigma_y$ is the Pauli-y matrix: $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for expectation value:**\n    The expectation value of an operator $A$ for a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by:\n    $\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}$\n    So, for our case, $\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle}{\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the components:**\n    *   First, we find the bra vector $\\langle\\chi|$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\chi\\rangle$.\n    *   Next, we calculate the normalization factor in the denominator, which is the inner product $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle$.\n    *   Then, we calculate the numerator term $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle$. This involves matrix-vector multiplication ($S_y|\\chi\\rangle$) followed by an inner product with $\\langle\\chi|$.\n    *   Finally, we divide the numerator by the denominator to get the result. The result will be in terms of $\\hbar$.\n\n4.  **Compare and select the answer:**\n    We will compare the calculated value with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct one.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `numpy` library for efficient handling of complex numbers and matrix operations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the spin state vector and the Pauli-y matrix.\n# The spin state is |chi> = (3i, 4). We represent it as a column vector.\nchi = np.array([[3j], [4]], dtype=complex)\n\n# The Pauli-y matrix.\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]], dtype=complex)\n\n# The spin operator S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y.\n# We will calculate the expectation value of sigma_y and then express the final answer in terms of hbar.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the bra vector <chi|, which is the conjugate transpose of |chi>.\nchi_dagger = chi.conj().T\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the normalization factor <chi|chi>.\n# This value should be real.\nnorm_squared = (chi_dagger @ chi).real[0, 0]\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the numerator term <chi|sigma_y|chi>.\n# First, apply the operator to the state: sigma_y |chi>\nsigma_y_on_chi = sigma_y @ chi\n# Then, take the inner product with <chi|.\nnumerator = (chi_dagger @ sigma_y_on_chi).real[0, 0]\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the expectation value of sigma_y.\nexp_val_sigma_y = numerator / norm_squared\n\n# The expectation value of S_y is (hbar/2) * <sigma_y>.\n# So, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * exp_val_sigma_y\n# Let's find the fraction that multiplies hbar.\n# <S_y>/hbar = exp_val_sigma_y / 2 = (numerator / norm_squared) / 2\nfinal_numerator = int(numerator)\nfinal_denominator = int(2 * norm_squared)\n\n# We can simplify this fraction. Let's use the original numbers.\n# <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (-24/25) = -12*hbar/25\nresult_numerator = int(numerator / 2)\nresult_denominator = int(norm_squared)\n\n\nprint(f\"The expectation value of S_y is given by <S_y> = <chi|S_y|chi> / <chi|chi>.\")\nprint(f\"The normalization factor <chi|chi> is: {norm_squared:.0f}\")\nprint(f\"The term <chi|sigma_y|chi> is: {numerator:.0f}\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value of sigma_y is: {numerator:.0f}/{norm_squared:.0f} = {exp_val_sigma_y}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * <sigma_y> = (hbar/2) * ({numerator:.0f}/{norm_squared:.0f}) = {result_numerator}/{result_denominator} * hbar.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing our result with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 25*hbar/2\")\nprint(\"B) -12*hbar/25\")\nprint(\"C) -25*hbar/2\")\nprint(\"D) 12*hbar/25\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option B.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
