    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   The initial state is a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   The measurement is for the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired eigenvalue for both is $-\\hbar$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m_l \\hbar$. Therefore, the desired measurement outcome corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta: $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$.\n    *   This implies a strict selection rule for the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   Any combination of $m_1$ and $m_2$ that does not sum to the total $m$ is a physically impossible outcome for a system in the state $|l, m>$. The probability of such an outcome is zero.\n\n3.  **Check the Condition:**\n    *   We have the total magnetic quantum number from the initial state: $m = -1$.\n    *   We have the individual magnetic quantum numbers from the desired measurement outcome: $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   We calculate the sum of the individual quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    *   Compare the required sum ($m=-1$) with the actual sum of the target state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$).\n    *   Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the selection rule is violated.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is exactly 0.\n\n```python\n# Define the quantum numbers from the problem description.\n\n# The coupled state is |l, m> = |2, -1>\nm_total = -1\n\n# The measurement is for the eigenvalues of L1z and L2z to both be -hbar.\n# The eigenvalue of Lz is m_l * hbar, so this corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\nm1_measured = -1\nm2_measured = -1\n\n# According to the rules of adding angular momentum, the total magnetic quantum number 'm'\n# must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers 'm1' and 'm2'.\n# This is a strict selection rule: m = m1 + m2.\n# If m != m1 + m2, the probability of that measurement is zero.\n\n# Let's check this condition.\nsum_of_m_measured = m1_measured + m2_measured\n\nprint(f\"The total magnetic quantum number of the system is m = {m_total}.\")\nprint(f\"The desired measurement outcome corresponds to m1 = {m1_measured} and m2 = {m2_measured}.\")\nprint(f\"The sum of the measured magnetic quantum numbers is m1 + m2 = {sum_of_m_measured}.\")\n\n# Compare the total m with the sum of the measured m's.\nif m_total == sum_of_m_measured:\n    # If the sum were correct, we would need to calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient\n    # to find the exact probability.\n    probability_string = \"non-zero, requiring calculation of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\"\nelse:\n    # Since the sum is not correct, the probability is exactly 0.\n    probability = 0\n    probability_string = f\"{probability}\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nCondition check: Is m_total == (m1_measured + m2_measured)?\")\nprint(f\"Result: {m_total} == {sum_of_m_measured} is {m_total == sum_of_m_measured}.\")\nprint(f\"\\nBecause the selection rule m = m1 + m2 is violated, the joint probability is 0.\")\n\n# The choices are: A) 1, B) 2/3, C) 1/2, D) 0\n# Our calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to choice D.\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice:\")\nprint(\"D\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
