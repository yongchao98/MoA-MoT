    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we need to calculate its fraction relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This fraction is known as the distribution coefficient, α₂.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define all cobalt species:** The species in solution are the free Co²⁺ ion and the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n2.  **Formulate the total cobalt concentration (C_total):**\n    C_total = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n3.  **Express each complex concentration in terms of [Co²⁺]:** Using the overall stability constants (β), we can write:\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n4.  **Calculate the distribution coefficient (α₂):** The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂] is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. By substituting the expressions from step 3, the [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n5.  **Calculate the percentage:** Multiply α₂ by 100. The provided total cobalt concentration c(Co) is not needed for this calculation, as we are looking for a relative percentage. We will use the given equilibrium concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Define the given stability constants and the thiocyanate concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nconc_scn = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The distribution coefficient (alpha_n) for a species [Co(SCN)n] is given by:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [SCN-]^n) / (Sum of all (beta_i * [SCN-]^i) terms from i=0 to 4)\n# where beta_0 is defined as 1 for the free Co(II) ion.\n\n# We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)2], which corresponds to n=2.\n\n# Calculate each term in the denominator of the alpha fraction\nterm0 = 1  # For free Co(II), beta_0 * [SCN-]^0\nterm1 = beta1 * (conc_scn**1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (conc_scn**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (conc_scn**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (conc_scn**4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing all cobalt species\ndenominator_sum = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2], is term2\nnumerator_term = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha2 = numerator_term / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_co_scn2 = alpha2 * 100\n\n# Print the final result along with the provided options\nprint(\"The calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is:\")\nprint(f\"{percentage_co_scn2:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nWhich corresponds to the following option:\")\nprint(\"A) 16.9%\")\nprint(\"B) 25.6%\")\nprint(\"C) 42.3%\")\nprint(\"D) 38.1%\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
