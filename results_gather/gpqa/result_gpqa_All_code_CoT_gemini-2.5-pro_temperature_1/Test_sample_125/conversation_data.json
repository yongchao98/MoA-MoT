    "Here is my thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to determine the number of distinct chemical compounds produced by two separate reactions and then figure out how many peaks these combined products will show on two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): normal-phase and chiral.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone. The \"(S)\" indicates it has a specific 3D arrangement at carbon number 5, making it a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will convert the ketone group (C=O) at carbon 3 into a secondary alcohol group (CH-OH).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original chiral center at carbon 5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged. The reduction of the ketone at carbon 3 creates a *new* chiral center. The hydride from LAH can attack the flat carbonyl group from two different faces (top or bottom). This lack of selectivity at the new center means two different stereoisomers will be formed.\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:** The products will have configurations at both carbon 3 and carbon 5. Since C5 is fixed as (S), the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This gives two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have more than one chiral center, and they are not mirror images of each other.\n    *   **Count:** Reaction I produces **2** stereoisomeric products.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule has two ketone groups and is **achiral** (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is also a reducing agent. \"Excess\" means it will reduce *both* ketone groups to secondary alcohol groups.\n    *   **Product Structure:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the two ketones creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4. Let's analyze the possible combinations of R/S configurations:\n        *   (2R, 4R)\n        *   (2S, 4S)\n        *   (2R, 4S)\n        *   (2S, 4R)\n    *   Now, let's check the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it an achiral, **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound, just flipped over.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction starts with an achiral molecule, so it must produce either achiral products or a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of enantiomers. Here, we get both. We get the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Count:** Reaction II produces **3** distinct stereoisomeric products: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n4.  **Combine the Products:**\n    *   From Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.\n    *   From Reaction II: 2 enantiomers + 1 meso compound.\n    *   Total unique compounds in the final mixture = 2 + 3 = **5 stereoisomers**.\n\n5.  **Analyze HPLC Separations:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, mainly polarity.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they **cannot be separated** by normal-phase HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** (and constitutional isomers) have different physical properties, so they **can be separated**.\n        *   Let's count the peaks:\n            1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will separate. That's **2 peaks**.\n            2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will *not* separate. That's **1 peak**.\n            3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the other products from Reaction II, so it will separate. That's **1 peak**.\n        *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with enantiomers.\n        *   It can separate **all stereoisomers**, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n        *   Therefore, the number of peaks will be equal to the total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n        *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Matching:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nNow I will write the Python code to formalize this step-by-step reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC for the combined products.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    # Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one (chiral ketone)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\n    # The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n    # This results in two products that are diastereomers of each other.\n    products_I = [\"(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\", \"(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\"]\n    num_products_I = len(products_I)\n    print(f\"Reaction I produces {num_products_I} products (diastereomers).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    # Starting material: Pentane-2,4-dione (achiral diketone)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of both ketones creates two new chiral centers (C2, C4).\n    # The possible stereoisomers are (2R,4R), (2S,4S), and a meso compound (2R,4S).\n    # (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers.\n    products_II = [\"(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\", \"(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\", \"meso-pentane-2,4-diol\"]\n    num_products_II = len(products_II)\n    print(f\"Reaction II produces {num_products_II} products (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound).\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine all products\n    all_products = products_I + products_II\n    total_unique_stereoisomers = len(all_products)\n    print(f\"\\nTotal unique stereoisomers in the combined mixture: {total_unique_stereoisomers}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate peaks in Chiral HPLC\n    # Chiral HPLC separates all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    chiral_hplc_peaks = total_unique_stereoisomers\n    print(f\"Chiral HPLC can separate all {total_unique_stereoisomers} stereoisomers.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of peaks in chiral HPLC is: {chiral_hplc_peaks}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC\n    # Normal-phase HPLC separates diastereomers but NOT enantiomers.\n    # Peaks from Reaction I: The two products are diastereomers, so they separate.
