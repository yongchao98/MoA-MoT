    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (level 2, with energy E2, and level 1, with energy E1) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in each level.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels (which we can assume are constant).\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n3.  **Relate Energy to Wavelength:** The energy difference (ΔE) corresponds to the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during the transition between the two levels. This is given by the formula:\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    where:\n    *   h is Planck's constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the transition.\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   Let `Ratio_nospot` be the population ratio when the temperature is T_nospot = 6000 K.\n    *   Let `Ratio_spot` be the population ratio when the temperature is T_spot = 5500 K.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is `Factor = Ratio_nospot / Ratio_spot`.\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\n    The (g₂/g₁) term cancels out. Using the rules of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)), we get:\n    Factor = exp( -ΔE/(k*T_nospot) - (-ΔE/(k*T_spot)) )\n    Factor = exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n    Substituting ΔE = hc/λ:\n    Factor = exp( (h*c / (λ*k)) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to define the constants and variables, perform the calculation, and print the result. The information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is not needed since the effective temperatures for both states are provided directly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_stellar_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations in two\n    energy levels changes with temperature in a stellar photosphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Physical Constants ---\n    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\n    c = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\n    k = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n    # --- Given Parameters ---\n    # Wavelength of the transition in meters\n    wavelength_A = 1448  # in Angstroms\n    wavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10\n\n    # Temperatures in Kelvin\n    T_nospot = 6000  # Effective temperature without spots\n    T_spot = 5500    # Effective temperature with spots\n\n    # --- Calculations ---\n    # The factor is given by exp( (h*c / (lambda*k)) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n\n    # 1.
