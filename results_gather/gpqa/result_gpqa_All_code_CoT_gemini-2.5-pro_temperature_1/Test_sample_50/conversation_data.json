    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the final answer.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V=0`). The presence of `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Use the Method of Images:** This problem is elegantly solved using the method of images. To satisfy the boundary condition (`V=0` on the sphere's surface), we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line joining the center and `q`. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):** Standard derivation shows that for the potential to be zero on the sphere's surface, the image charge and its position must be:\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. A key result from electrostatics states that the energy of a charge `q` near a grounded conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` caused by the induced charges on the conductor. In our image charge model, this is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Formula:**\n    *   First, find the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`:\n        `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Next, calculate `V_induced`, the potential at `q`'s location due to `q'`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / distance = k * (-q * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        Simplifying this gives:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Finally, calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** This derived formula matches option D.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols\nk, q, d, R = sympy.symbols('k q d R')\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * d / (d**2 + R**2)\",\n    \"B\": \"U = -k * q**2 * d / (d**2 - R**2)\",\n    \"C\": \"U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * R**2 / (d**2 - R**2)\",\n    \"D\": \"U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * R / (d**2 - R**2)\"\n}\n\n# The derived correct formula for the potential energy\ncorrect_formula = \"-(1/2) * k * q**2 * R / (d**2 - R**2)\"\ncorrect_choice = \"D\"\n\nprint(\"The problem is to find the net potential energy of a system with a charge q at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R.\")\nprint(\"\\nUsing the method of images, the potential energy U can be derived.\")\nprint(\"The steps lead to the formula: U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\")\nprint(\"\\nLet's compare this with the given options:\")\nfor choice, formula in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) {formula}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe derived formula matches option {correct_choice}.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is {correct_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
