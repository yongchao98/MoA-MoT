    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`) by the formula T_eq ∝ 1/√a. This means the ratio of two planets' temperatures is T₁/T₂ = √(a₂/a₁). Squaring both sides gives a₂/a₁ = (T₁/T₂)².\n\n2.  **Find the Ratio of Orbital Distances for Planet3 to Planet1 (a₃/a₁):** We need to find `a₃/a₁`. We can express this as a product of the known ratios: a₃/a₁ = (a₃/a₂) * (a₂/a₁).\n    *   Using the formula from step 1: a₂/a₁ = (T_eq1/T_eq2)²\n    *   Similarly: a₃/a₂ = (T_eq2/T_eq3)²\n    *   Therefore, a₃/a₁ = (T_eq2/T_eq3)² * (T_eq1/T_eq2)² = ((T_eq1/T_eq2) * (T_eq2/T_eq3))² = (T_eq1/T_eq3)².\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`), so P² ∝ a³. This means P ∝ a^(3/2). The ratio of the periods is therefore P₃/P₁ = (a₃/a₁)^(3/2).\n\n4.  **Combine and Calculate:** Substitute the expression for `a₃/a₁` from step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n    *   P₃/P₁ = ((T_eq1/T_eq3)²)^(3/2)\n    *   P₃/P₁ = (T_eq1/T_eq3)³\n    *   We can calculate T_eq1/T_eq3 by multiplying the given ratios: T_eq1/T_eq3 = (T_eq1/T_eq2) * (T_eq2/T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3.\n    *   The final calculation is P₃/P₁ = (1.4 * 2.3)³.\n\n5.  **Note on Unused Information:** The mass ratios and the specific albedo value are not needed for this calculation. The planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's law, and the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio of temperatures since it is the same for all planets.\n\n```python\n# Define the given ratios\ntemp_ratio_1_to_2 = 1.4\ntemp_ratio_2_to_3 = 2.3\n\n# The goal is to find the ratio of the orbital periods P3 / P1.\n\n# Step 1: Relate orbital period (P) to equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n# From physics, P is proportional to a^(3/2) (Kepler's Third Law),\n# and T_eq is proportional to a^(-1/2).\n# Combining these, we find that P is proportional to T_eq^(-3).\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)^(-3) = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3.\n# T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\ntemp_ratio_1_to_3 = temp_ratio_1_to_2 * temp_ratio_2_to_3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final orbital period ratio.\n# P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\nperiod_ratio_3_to_1 = temp_ratio_1_to_3 ** 3\n\n# Print the final result and the given choices for comparison.\nprint(f\"The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of: {period_ratio_3_to_1:.1f}\")\nprint(\"Choices:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 10.4\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 3.2\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 4.4\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 33.4\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
