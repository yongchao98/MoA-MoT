    "My plan is to solve this quantum mechanics problem by following these steps:\n1.  **Construct the Matrix Operator `Ay`**: I will define the matrix `S` as given and use the constant `c = h/(4π)` to form the operator `Ay`.\n2.  **Calculate Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: I will use Python's `numpy` library to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix `Ay`. This will allow me to analyze statements B and C.\n3.  **Analyze the Eigenfunctions**: By comparing the calculated eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) with the standard basis vectors (`[1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`), I can evaluate the correctness of statement D.\n4.  **Check Commutation Relations**: To verify statement A, I need to check if `Ay` commutes with `A^2` and `Az`. Two operators have a common set of eigenfunctions if and only if they commute. I will define the matrix for `Az` (proportional to the Pauli Z matrix) and calculate the commutators `[Ay, A^2]` and `[Ay, Az]`.\n5.  **Conclude**: Based on the results from the previous steps, I will determine which of the four statements is correct and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_muon_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the muon's\n    angular momentum operator Ay and evaluates the given statements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set print options for better readability of complex numbers\n    np.set_printoptions(precision=3, suppress=True)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the matrix operator Ay.\")\n    # The matrix S is the Pauli-Y matrix.\n    # S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    S = np.array([[0, -1j],\n                  [1j, 0]], dtype=complex)\n    # The operator Ay = c * S.
