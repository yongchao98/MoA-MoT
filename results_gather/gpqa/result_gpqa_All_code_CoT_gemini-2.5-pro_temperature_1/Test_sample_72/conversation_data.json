    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):**\n    The problem involves two objects moving at relativistic speeds in the same reference frame. To find the speed of astronaut 2 relative to astronaut 1, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n    I will take the absolute value of the result since speed is a scalar quantity.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):**\n    The total energy of a single relativistic object is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n    `E_total = E1 + E2 = (γ1 * m1 * c^2) + (γ2 * m2 * c^2)`\n    I will calculate the Lorentz factor for each astronaut (`γ1` and `γ2`) and then use them to find their individual energies (`E1` and `E2`). Finally, I will sum these energies.\n\n3.  **Compare and Select the Answer:**\n    After calculating `v_rel` and `E_total`, I will compare the results with the given options (A, B, C, D) to identify the correct choice.\n\nI will now implement these steps in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Let m=1 and c=1 for calculation, and add them back in the final print statement.\nm = 1\nc = 1\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel) ---\n# Using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2)\n# We calculate the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame.\n# We'll take the absolute value for the speed.\nv_rel_numerator = v2 - v1\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\nv_rel = abs(v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the total energy (E_total) ---\n# Total energy is E_total = E1 + E2\n# E = gamma * m * c^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n# Calculate gamma for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\n# Calculate energy of astronaut 1\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Calculate gamma for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\n# Calculate energy of astronaut 2\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\n# Calculate total energy of the system\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\n# --- Step 3: Print the results and choose the correct option ---\nprint(f\"Calculated relative speed: {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total energy: {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\")\nprint(\"B) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\")\nprint(\"C) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\")\nprint(\"D) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option C.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer is C\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
