    "This is a classic problem in peptide and organic chemistry analysis. Here is a step-by-step plan to deduce the correct answer from the provided analytical data.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The LC-MS shows two peaks, but both have the *same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This tells us we have two chemical species that are *isomers* (same chemical formula, same mass). This fact immediately allows us to rule out options that involve a change in mass.\n2.  **Analyze the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) Data:** We have two distinct peaks in the 1H NMR for a single proton and two separable peaks in the LC. Standard NMR and LC are achiral techniques. The key question is: which type of isomers are distinguishable under achiral conditions?\n3.  **Evaluate the Isomer Types:**\n    *   **Enantiomers:** These are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties (boiling point, solubility, etc.) and are indistinguishable in an achiral environment. They would show a single peak in a standard NMR and co-elute (appear as one peak) in a standard LC. Therefore, they cannot be the explanation.\n    *   **Diastereoisomers:** These are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical properties and are distinguishable in achiral environments. They would give different signals in an NMR spectrum and would separate into distinct peaks in an LC run. This fits the observations perfectly. In peptides, a common source of diastereomerism is the presence of stable *rotamers* (cis/trans isomers) around the amide bond, especially with certain amino acids like proline. These rotamers interconvert slowly, allowing them to be observed as separate species on the NMR and LC timescales.\n4.  **Conclude:** Based on the evidence, the compound must exist as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\nNow, let's translate this logic into Python code to select the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Suppress any potential warnings if libraries were used, for cleaner output.\n# In this logic-based script, it's not strictly necessary but good practice.\nif not sys.warnoptions:\n    import warnings\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n\ndef analyze_spectroscopic_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the nature of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the experimental observations ---\n    # From LC-MS: Two peaks have the same mass, which matches the expected product.\n    observation_mass_spec = \"isomers\"  # Not a precursor, not a side-product with different mass\n\n    # From 1H NMR and LC: Two distinct peaks are seen with achiral methods.\n    observation_separability = \"distinguishable_by_achiral_methods\"\n\n    # --- Step 2: Evaluate the options based on the observations ---\n    options = {\n        'A': \"'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\",\n        'B': \"The compound is contaminated with a precursor\",\n        'C': \"The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\",\n        'D': \"The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\"\n    }\n\n    # Analysis based on Mass Spec\n    # Options A and B imply a different molecular weight than the target compound.\n    # The MS data shows the mass is correct for the target molecule.\n    if observation_mass_spec == \"isomers\":\n        print(\"Analysis Step 1: The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product.
