    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:** The problem describes a two-step electric dipole (E1) transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to a final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 1s state). The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State (First Transition):**\n    *   The initial state is $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$, which has $l=0$.\n    *   According to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   According to the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0 - \\Delta m$, so $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   For a cascade decay from $n=3$ to $n=1$, the most probable intermediate state will have $n'=2$.\n    *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Check the Second Transition:** The second transition is from an intermediate state $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n    *   For this step, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$, is also allowed for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes listed in the options are valid.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** We need to find the probability of one specific path, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **First step probability:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state is isotropic, meaning it does not have a preferred direction. Consequently, it populates all allowed final magnetic substates ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) with equal probability. Since there are three such states, the probability (or branching ratio) for transitioning to any single one of them is $1/3$.\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$.\n    *   **Second step probability:** The intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a 2p state) will decay to a state with lower energy. The only available state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of this transition occurring is essentially 1 (or 100%).\n        $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) \\approx 1$.\n    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps:\n        $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $1/3$. The same logic applies to the other two possible routes through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$; they also each have a probability of $1/3$. Comparing our result with the options, option A is the only one that correctly identifies a valid path and its corresponding probability.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_h_atom_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of H-atom decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define initial, intermediate, and final states based on selection rules.\n    initial_state = \"|3,0,0>\"\n    final_state = \"|1,0,0>\"\n    # E1 selection rules: delta_l = +/- 1, delta_m = 0, +/- 1.\n    # From l=0, intermediate state must have l=1.\n    # From m=0, intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, 1.\n    # For a cascade, we consider the n=2 intermediate state.\n    intermediate_states = [\"|2,1,-1>\", \"|2,1,0>\", \"|2,1,1>\"]\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the probability of the first transition.\n    # The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric.\n    # Spontaneous emission populates the 3 possible m' states of the l=1 orbital equally.\n    num_intermediate_states = len(intermediate_states)\n    prob_step1 = sympy.Rational(1, num_intermediate_states)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the probability of the second transition.\n    # The intermediate 2p state (|2,1,m'>) decays almost exclusively to the 1s state (|1,0,0>).\n    # Other decays are either forbidden or highly suppressed.\n    prob_step2 = 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the total probability for one specific cascade path.\n    # Example path: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>\n    total_prob = prob_step1 * prob_step2\n    \n    # Step 5: Format the output and select the correct option.\n    print(\"Problem Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The decay is a two-step dipole transition from {initial_state} to {final_state}.\")\n    print(\"The electric dipole selection rules are \\\\Delta l = \\\\pm 1 and \\\\Delta m = 0, \\\\pm 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: First Transition (|3,0,0> -> intermediate state)\")\n    print(f\"The initial state has l=0.
