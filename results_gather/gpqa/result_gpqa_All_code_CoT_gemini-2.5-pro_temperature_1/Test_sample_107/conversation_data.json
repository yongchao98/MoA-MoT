    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy:** The paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman effect energy, is given by the formula:\n    $ E_{B} = \\mu_B \\cdot m \\cdot B $\n    Where:\n    *   $ \\mu_B $ is the Bohr magneton ($9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$).\n    *   $ m $ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem specifies \"small values of m,\" so we'll use $m=1$ for our calculation.\n    *   $ B $ is the magnetic field strength, given as $1$ T.\n    The problem refers to this energy as $ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle $.\n\n2.  **Calculate the transition energy:** The energy of a photon ($ \\Delta E $) associated with a specific transition is related to its wavelength ($ \\lambda $) by the formula:\n    $ \\Delta E = \\frac{h \\cdot c}{\\lambda} $\n    Where:\n    *   $ h $ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ JÂ·s}$).\n    *   $ c $ is the speed of light ($3.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$).\n    *   $ \\lambda $ is the wavelength, given as $0.4861 \\mu m = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n3.  **Compare the two energies:** After calculating both $ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle $ and $ \\Delta E $, we will compare their orders of magnitude to determine which of the given options (A, B, C, or D) is correct.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Step 1: Define constants and given values ---\n\n# Bohr magneton in J/T\nmu_B = const.value('Bohr magneton')\n\n# Planck's constant in J*s\nh = const.h\n\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = const.c\n\n# Magnetic field strength in Tesla\nB = 1.0  # T\n\n# Wavelength in meters\n# Given as 0.4861 micrometers = 0.4861 * 10^-6 meters\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6 # m\n\n# Orbital magnetic quantum number (a small integer value)\nm = 1\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H> ---\n# Formula: <H> = mu_B * m * B\nparamagnetic_energy = mu_B * m * B\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the transition energy Delta_E ---\n# Formula: Delta_E = h * c / lambda\ntransition_energy = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# --- Step 4: Compare the two energies and print the results ---\n\nprint(f\"Constants used:\")\nprint(f\"Bohr Magneton (mu_B): {mu_B:.4e} J/T\")\nprint(f\"Planck's Constant (h): {h:.4e} J*s\")\nprint(f\"Speed of Light (c): {c:.4e} m/s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nprint(f\"Calculations:\")\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> for m={m} and B={B}T is: {paramagnetic_energy:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta_E for lambda={lambda_m * 1e6} um is: {transition_energy:.4e} J\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nprint(\"Comparison:\")\n# Compare the calculated energies\nif paramagnetic_energy < transition_energy / 100: # Using a factor of 100 to define \"much less than\"\n    print(f\"The paramagnetic energy ({paramagnetic_energy:.4e} J) is much less than the transition energy ({transition_energy:.4e} J).\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the relationship: <H> << Delta E\")\n    final_choice = \"B\"\nelif transition_energy < paramagnetic_energy / 100:\n    print(f\"The paramagnetic energy ({paramagnetic_energy:.4e} J) is much greater than the transition energy ({transition_energy:.4e} J).\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the relationship: <H> >> Delta E\")\n    final_choice = \"A\"\nelif abs(paramagnetic_energy - transition_energy) / transition_energy < 0.01: # Checking if they are nearly equal\n    print(f\"The paramagnetic energy is approximately equal to the transition energy.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the relationship: <H> = Delta E\")\n    final_choice = \"C\"\nelse:\n    print(f\"The paramagnetic energy is greater than the transition energy, but not by a large order of magnitude.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the relationship: <H> > Delta E\")\n    final_choice = \"D\"\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Choice:\")\nprint(\"A) <H> >> Delta E\")\nprint(\"B) <H> << Delta E\")\nprint(\"C) <H> = Delta E\")\nprint(\"D) <H> > Delta E\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe correct option is {final_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
