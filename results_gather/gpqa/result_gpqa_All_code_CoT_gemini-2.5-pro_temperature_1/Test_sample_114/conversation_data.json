    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   Initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies: $E_{initial} = (\\gamma_{electron} + \\gamma_{positron}) m c^2$.\n    *   Final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the two photons. Since they have equal energy, $E_{final} = 2 E_{photon}$.\n    *   By equating initial and final energy, we can find the energy of a single photon: $E_{photon} = (\\gamma_{electron} + \\gamma_{positron}) m c^2 / 2$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after. Momentum is a vector, so we consider its components.\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle is $p = mc\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$. The momentum of a photon is $p_{photon} = E_{photon} / c$.\n    *   The initial momentum is entirely along the horizontal (x-axis), as the electron moves left-to-right (positive momentum) and the positron moves right-to-left (negative momentum). $p_{x, initial} = (mc\\sqrt{\\gamma_{electron}^2 - 1}) - (mc\\sqrt{\\gamma_{positron}^2 - 1})$.\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical (y-axis) is zero.\n    *   To conserve momentum in the y-direction, the two photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle $\\theta$.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta: $p_{x, final} = 2 p_{photon} \\cos(\\theta)$.\n    *   By equating the initial and final x-momentum, we can solve for $\\cos(\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Angle:** The angle we need to find is the total angle between the two photons, which is $2\\theta$. We can calculate this from the value of $\\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factors\ngamma_electron = 4\ngamma_positron = 2\n\n# Step 1: Conservation of Energy\n# We can work in units where m=1 and c=1 for simplicity, as they will cancel out.\n# E_initial = (gamma_electron + gamma_positron) * m * c**2\n# E_photon = E_initial / 2\n# So, E_photon = (gamma_electron + gamma_positron) / 2 = (4 + 2) / 2 = 3 (in units of mc^2)\n# p_photon = E_photon / c = 3 (in units of mc)\np_photon_magnitude = (gamma_electron + gamma_positron) / 2\n\n# Step 2: Conservation of Momentum\n# p_x_initial = (m*c*sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1)) - (m*c*sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1))\n# p_x_initial = sqrt(4^2 - 1) - sqrt(2^2 - 1) (in units of mc)\np_x_initial = math.sqrt(gamma_electron**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_positron**2 - 1)\n\n# p_x_final = 2 * p_photon_magnitude * cos(theta)\n# Equating p_x_initial and p_x_final:\n# p_x_initial = 2 * p_photon_magnitude * cos(theta)\n# cos(theta) = p_x_initial / (2 * p_photon_magnitude)\ncos_theta = p_x_initial / (2 * p_photon_magnitude)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Final Angle\n# theta is the angle of one photon with the horizontal axis.\n# The angle is in radians, so we need to convert it to degrees.\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the two photons is 2 * theta.\ntotal_angle_deg = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(\"The angle between the directions of the two photons is:\")\n# Print the options and the calculated result to find the closest match.\nprint(f\"A) 172\")\nprint(f\"B) 74\")\nprint(f\"C) 96\")\nprint(f\"D) 138\")\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated angle: {total_angle_deg:.2f} degrees\")\nprint(\"The closest option is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
