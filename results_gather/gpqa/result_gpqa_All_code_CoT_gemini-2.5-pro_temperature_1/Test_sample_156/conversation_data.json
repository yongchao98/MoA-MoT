    "Of course. Here is my analysis and the Python code to determine the best approach for designing the diagnostic kit.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The task is to design a *molecular diagnostic kit* for a *retrovirus*. This means we need to detect the virus's genetic material. A key characteristic of a retrovirus is that its genome is made of RNA.\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option's Scientific Validity:**\n    *   **Option A:** Suggests using `cDNA sequencing` to identify the virus. Since retroviruses have an RNA genome, converting it to complementary DNA (cDNA) via reverse transcription is the correct first step for sequencing. It then proposes a `real-time PCR` kit, which is the modern gold standard for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of nucleic acids (in this case, via RT-qPCR). This approach is scientifically sound.\n    *   **Option B:** Suggests identifying the virus based on `symptoms`. Symptoms are often non-specific and cannot provide the genetic sequence required to design a molecular test. This first step is flawed.\n    *   **Option C:** Suggests performing `DNA sequencing`. This is incorrect because a retrovirus has an RNA genome. You cannot directly sequence DNA that isn't there; you must create cDNA from the RNA first.\n    *   **Option D:** Suggests detecting `IgG antibodies` using an `ELISA` kit. This is an immunological/serological test, not a molecular one, as it detects the host's immune response rather than the virus itself. Furthermore, IgG antibodies typically appear later in an infection, making this method less suitable for quick, early diagnosis during an outbreak.\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to logically evaluate each option based on the scientific requirements (RNA virus, molecular test, speed). The script will print its analysis and identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_diagnostic_kit_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the options for designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the core scientific facts of the problem\n    problem_details = {\n        \"pathogen_type\": \"retrovirus\",\n        \"genome_type\": \"RNA\",\n        \"required_kit\": \"molecular\",\n        \"goal\": \"quick and accurate diagnosis\"\n    }\n\n    # Define the choices with their proposed methods\n    options = {\n        'A': {\n            'identification': 'cDNA sequencing',\n            'kit_type': 'real time PCR',\n            'rationale': 'Correct for RNA virus. cDNA is synthesized from RNA.
