    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism.**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) groups are part of double bonds within the ring and have no attached hydrogen atoms. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are adjacent to carbonyl groups and each has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, so this compound can and does exhibit tautomerism (to form phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does *not* show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism.**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common cause of chirality is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound will show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is a trans-alkene. It is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it will not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Combine and Select the Final Answer.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This combination matches option C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the properties of four compounds to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Part A: Determine which compound does not show tautomerism.\n    # Tautomerism requires alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon next to a C=O group).\n    \n    # Analysis of Benzoquinone:\n    # The carbons next to the C=O groups are part of C=C double bonds and have no hydrogens.\n    # No alpha-hydrogens means no tautomerism.\n    compound_A_no_tautomerism = \"benzoquinone\"\n    \n    # Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:\n    # The CH2 groups between the C=O groups have alpha-hydrogens.\n    # It shows tautomerism (forming phloroglucinol).\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis for Tautomerism (Compound A)\")\n    print(\" - Benzoquinone has no alpha-hydrogens, so it does not show tautomerism.\")\n    print(\" - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens, so it shows tautomerism.\")\n    print(f\" - Therefore, compound A (does not show tautomerism) is: {compound_A_no_tautomerism}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Part B: Determine which compound shows optical isomerism.\n    # Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different groups attached).\n    \n    # Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:\n    # The central carbon is attached to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.\n    # These four groups are different, so it has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.\n    compound_B_optical_isomerism = \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"\n    \n    # Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:\n    # This molecule is a trans-alkene and is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    # It has no chiral centers and does not show optical isomerism.\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis for Optical Isomerism (Compound B)\")\n    print(\" - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (a carbon with 4 different groups), so it shows optical isomerism.\")\n    print(\" - Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.\")\n    print(f\" - Therefore, compound B (shows optical isomerism) is: {compound_B_optical_isomerism}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Match the findings with the given options.\n    # Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Incorrect)\n    # Option B: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n    # Option C: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n    # Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n    \n    final_choice = \"C\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is the one where A is '{compound_A_no_tautomerism}' and B is '{compound_B_optical_isomerism}'.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    print(f\"<<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```"
