    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula for Transit Probability**: For a planet on a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit (`P_transit`) is the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `P_transit = R_s / a`\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Knowns**: We are not given the semi-major axis `a`, but we have the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`). We can use Kepler's Third Law, which states that `P^2` is proportional to `a^3 / M_s`. Rearranging for `a`, we find that `a` is proportional to `(M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas**: Substitute the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula. This shows that `P_transit` is proportional to `R_s / (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities**: We need to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2 (`P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`).\n    `Ratio = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * P_1^2)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * P_2^2)^(1/3)]`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Relationships**:\n    *   The stars have the same radii: `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n    *   The star of Planet_1 is twice as massive: `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter: `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3`, so `P_2 / P_1 = 3`, and `P_2^2 / P_1^2 = 9`.\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value**: Plug these values into the ratio formula and calculate the result. The python code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the ratios of the physical parameters based on the problem description.\n# Ratio of stellar radii (R_s1 / R_s2)\nratio_R = 1.0\n# Ratio of stellar masses (M_s1 / M_s2)\nratio_M = 2.0\n# Ratio of orbital periods (P_1 / P_2)\nratio_P = 1.0 / 3.0\n\n# Step 2: The ratio of transit probabilities (Prob_1 / Prob_2) is given by:\n# (R_s1/R_s2) * [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)\n# This can be rewritten using our defined ratios:\n# ratio_R * [ (1/ratio_M) * (1/ratio_P)^2 ]^(1/3)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the probability ratio.\nprobability_ratio = ratio_R * ( (1/ratio_M) * (1/ratio_P)**2 )**(1/3)\n\n# Step 4: Determine which planet is preferred and format the output.\nif probability_ratio > 1:\n    preferred_planet = \"Planet_1\"\n    factor = probability_ratio\nelse:\n    preferred_planet = \"Planet_2\"\n    factor = 1 / probability_ratio\n\n# Step 5: Print the results based on the provided options.\nprint(f\"The ratio of transit probabilities (Planet_1 / Planet_2) is: {probability_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"{preferred_planet} is preferred due to its ~{factor:.2f} times higher probability to transit.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
