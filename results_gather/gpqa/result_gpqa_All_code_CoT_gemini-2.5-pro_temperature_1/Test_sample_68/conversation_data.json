    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum distance a particle must travel to be considered \"observed\" and relate this to the 30% decay condition. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**: This tells us how much time is dilated and length is contracted from the lab's frame of reference. It's calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and rest mass (m) using the formula $\\gamma = E/m$.\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (L)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. The formula is $L = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$, where c is the speed of light and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n3.  **Interpret the observation condition**: \"To observe at least 30% of the decays\" means we need a detector with a resolution fine enough to see the decay path. We interpret this as finding a resolution distance, `d_res`, such that the probability of a particle traveling *further* than `d_res` is 30%. If the particle travels a distance less than the resolution, we cannot distinguish its creation and decay points.\n4.  **Calculate the resolution (d_res)**: The probability of a particle traveling a distance `x` or more is given by the exponential decay law in terms of distance: $P(\\text{distance} > x) = e^{-x/L}$. We set this probability to 0.3 and solve for the distance `x`, which will be our required resolution `d_res`. This gives us the equation $d_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We will plug in the given values into these formulas to find the resolution and then compare it to the provided options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1. Define physical constants and given values.\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\ntau0 = 8e-16   # Proper lifetime in s\nE = 27         # Energy in GeV\nm = 3.41       # Mass in GeV\n\n# 2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# E = gamma * m, so gamma = E / m\ngamma = E / m\n\n# 3. Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame.\n# L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# 4. Interpret \"observe at least 30% of the decays\".\n# This means the probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than\n# the resolution 'd_res' must be at least 0.3.\n# P(distance > d_res) = exp(-d_res / L) = 0.3\nfraction_to_observe = 0.3\n\n# 5. Solve for the minimum resolution (d_res).\n# -d_res / L = ln(0.3) => d_res = -L * ln(0.3)\nresolution = -L * math.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\n# Define the options for comparison\noptions = {\n    'A': 2.08e-6,\n    'B': 2.08e-3,\n    'C': 2.08e-9,\n    'D': 2.08e-1\n}\n\n# Find the closest option to the calculated result\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - resolution))\n\nprint(f\"Given values:\")\nprint(f\"Proper lifetime (tau0): {tau0} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy (E): {E} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Mass (m): {m} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Calculated Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated mean decay length (L): {L:.4e} m\")\nprint(f\"Calculated minimum resolution required: {resolution:.4e} m\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Comparing with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) {options['A']:.4e} m\")\nprint(f\"B) {options['B']:.4e} m\")\nprint(f\"C) {options['C']:.4e} m\")\nprint(f\"D) {options['D']:.4e} m\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The calculated value {resolution:.4e} m is closest to option A ({options['A']:.4e} m).\")\nprint(f\"Final choice: {closest_option}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
