    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will calculate the number of moles for each of the solutes: the weak acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (HCl), and the strong base (Ba(OH)2). Note that Ba(OH)2 releases two moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of Ba(OH)2.\n2.  Next, I will simulate the neutralization reactions. The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2) first.\n3.  After the strong acid-base reaction, I will determine if there is any excess H⁺ or OH⁻. The remaining strong species will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n4.  After all reactions are complete, the final solution will contain a large excess of strong base (OH⁻). The pH of the solution will be determined by the concentration of this excess OH⁻.\n5.  Finally, I will calculate the total volume of the mixed solution, determine the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions, calculate the pOH from this concentration, and then convert pOH to pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_final_ph():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the pH of a solution made by mixing CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define initial conditions and calculate moles\n    # Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid\n    V_ch3cooh = 0.500  # L (500 mL)\n    M_ch3cooh = 0.1   # M\n    moles_ch3cooh = V_ch3cooh * M_ch3cooh\n\n    # Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid\n    V_hcl = 0.400     # L (400 mL)\n    M_hcl = 0.2       # M\n    moles_h_strong = V_hcl * M_hcl  # HCl is a strong acid, so moles H+ = moles HCl\n\n    # Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base\n    V_baoh2 = 0.300   # L (300 mL)\n    M_baoh2 = 0.3     # M\n    # Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions per formula unit\n    moles_oh_strong = 2 * V_baoh2 * M_baoh2\n\n    # Step 2: Neutralize strong acid and strong base\n    # H+ + OH- -> H2O\n    if moles_oh_strong > moles_h_strong:\n        moles_oh_after_strong_neut = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\n    else:\n        # This case is not applicable here but included for completeness\n        moles_oh_after_strong_neut = 0\n\n    # Step 3: React remaining strong base with weak acid\n    # CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n    if moles_oh_after_strong_neut > moles_ch3cooh:\n        moles_oh_final_excess = moles_oh_after_strong_neut - moles_ch3cooh\n    else:\n        # This case is not applicable here\n        moles_oh_final_excess = 0\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate final pH from excess strong base\n    # Calculate total volume\n    V_total = V_ch3cooh + V_hcl + V_baoh2\n\n    # Calculate concentration of excess OH-\n    # The pH is dominated by the excess strong base.\n    conc_oh_excess = moles_oh_final_excess / V_total\n\n    # Calculate pOH and then pH\n    poh = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\n    final_ph = 14 - poh\n\n    # Print the final result and the options\n    print(f\"The calculated final pH of the solution is: {final_ph:.2f}\")\n    print(\"\\nAvailable choices:\")\n    print(\"A) 8.92\")\n    print(\"B) 12.62\")\n    print(\"C) 8.68\")\n    print(\"D) 1.38\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated pH matches option B.\")\n\n# Run the calculation and print the output\ncalculate_final_ph()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
