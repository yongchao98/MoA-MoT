    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct starting materials:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures:** First, we need to understand the chemical structures of the product, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (a delta-lactone), and the potential starting materials, which are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This starting material is a dicarboxylic acid derivative with both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Intermediate:** The formation of the lactone product requires a precursor molecule that has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. We will determine the structure of this hydroxy acid intermediate.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (with LiBH4):** We will examine the selectivity of the reducing agent Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`). It selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. We'll see how this transforms the starting material **A** into the hydroxy acid intermediate and then the final (R)-lactone product, allowing us to deduce the stereochemistry of **A**.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (with BH3):** We will examine the selectivity of the reducing agent Borane (`BH3`). It selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. We'll see how this transforms the starting material **B** into a hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes to the final (S)-lactone product. This will allow us to deduce the stereochemistry of **B**.\n5.  **Conclusion:** By combining the results from both reactions, we can identify the correct pair of starting materials from the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step solution to the stereochemistry problem\n    and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-Step Analysis:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze structures\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Product: (R/S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
