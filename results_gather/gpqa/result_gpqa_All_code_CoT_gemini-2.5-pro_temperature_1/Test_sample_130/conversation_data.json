    "This problem describes a classic organic chemistry reaction and its analysis using NMR spectroscopy. Let's break it down step-by-step to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent (one signal), and by symmetry, there are only two types of carbons: the two alkene carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly given as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Identify the Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored). The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   In the **endo product**, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system, placing it \"under\" the double bond derived from the diene.\n    *   In the **exo product**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in 3D space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not bonded.\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* adduct.\n    *   Let's visualize the *endo* product. The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond of the other ring. This brings the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused very close to the two methyl groups that are also on that same face (*syn* methyls).\n    *   In the *exo* product, the anhydride ring points away, so these protons are far from the methyl groups. Therefore, the NOE interaction between the anhydride protons and the *syn* methyls is the key difference.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals:**\n    *   Let's look at the protons in the product and the signals provided in the options.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused. They are bridgehead protons and are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly, shifting them downfield to ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Two 6H singlets (~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm):** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. Due to the geometry of the bicyclic system, they are not equivalent. The two methyl groups on the same side as the anhydride ring (*syn* methyls) are in a different chemical environment than the two on the opposite side (*anti* methyls).\n        *   The *syn* methyls are spatially close to the electron-withdrawing anhydride ring. This proximity causes them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). Thus, they correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   The *anti* methyls are further away and are more shielded, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal likely corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the single-carbon bridge of the bicyclic system.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major (*endo*) product is between the protons that are only close in that isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride-fused protons (~3.5 ppm) and the *syn*-methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** and the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the Diels-Alder reaction and its products' NMR spectra\n    to determine the correct NOESY cross-peak for the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify reactants and reaction type.\n    # Dienophile: Maleic anhydride (from NMR data and dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid).\n    # Diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    # Reaction: Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n    # Step 2: Identify major and minor products.\n    # The major product is the kinetically favored 'endo' adduct.\n    # The minor product is the thermodynamically favored 'exo' adduct.\n    \n    # Step 3: Understand NOESY and the structural difference.\n    # NOESY shows through-space proton-proton proximity.\n    # We need a proximity present in the 'endo' product but absent in the 'exo' product.\n    # In the 'endo' adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked under the diene's original double bond.\n    # This brings the two protons on the anhydride-fused ring close to the 'syn' methyl groups (those on the same face as the anhydride).\n    # In the 'exo' adduct, the anhydride ring points away, so these protons are far from the methyl groups.\n\n    # Step 4: Assign the NMR signals from the options to the protons in the 'endo' product.\n    # - 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: These are the two protons on the anhydride-fused part of the ring.
