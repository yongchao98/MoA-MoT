    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to calculate the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X:\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's lifetime in its rest frame ($\\tau$)**: The lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) according to the formula $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**: This factor accounts for time dilation due to the particle's high velocity. It's calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E_X$) to its rest mass energy ($m_X c^2$). In particle physics units where c=1, this is simply $\\gamma = E_X / m_X$.\n3.  **Calculate the particle's velocity factor ($\\beta$)**: $\\beta = v/c$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. It can be found from the Lorentz factor using the relation $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance ($d$)**: The distance is the particle's velocity multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. The lab frame lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor ($\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$). Therefore, the mean decay distance is $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau)$. A more direct formula combines these steps: $d = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nE_X_GeV = 8.0  # Production energy in GeV\nm_X_GeV = 1.2  # Mass in GeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0  # Width in MeV\n\n# --- Physical constants ---\n# h-bar * c in MeV*fm (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\nhbarc_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n# --- Step-by-step calculation ---\n\n# 1. Convert all energy units to MeV for consistency\nE_X_MeV = E_X_GeV * 1000\nm_X_MeV = m_X_GeV * 1000\n\n# 2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# gamma = E / m\ngamma = E_X_MeV / m_X_MeV\n\n# 3. Calculate the velocity factor (beta = v/c)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\n# 4. Calculate the mean decay distance (d) in the lab frame\n# The formula is d = gamma * beta * (hbar * c) / Gamma\n# The result will be in femtometers (fm) because hbarc is in MeV*fm and Gamma is in MeV.\ndecay_distance_fm = gamma * beta * hbarc_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV\n\n# 5. Convert the distance from femtometers to meters\n# 1 fm = 10^-15 m\ndecay_distance_m = decay_distance_fm * 1e-15\n\n# --- Print the results ---\nprint(\"Calculation of the Mean Decay Distance:\")\nprint(f\"Given Energy (E_X): {E_X_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Given Mass (m_X): {m_X_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Given Width (Gamma_X): {Gamma_X_MeV} MeV\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma)\")\nprint(f\"gamma = E_X / m_X = {gamma:.4f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate velocity factor (beta)\")\nprint(f\"beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = {beta:.4f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate mean decay distance (d)\")\nprint(f\"d = gamma * beta * (hbar*c / Gamma)\")\nprint(f\"d = {gamma:.4f} * {beta:.4f} * ({hbarc_MeV_fm} MeV*fm / {Gamma_X_MeV} MeV)\")\nprint(f\"d = {decay_distance_fm:.4f} fm\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 4: Convert distance to meters\")\nprint(f\"d = {decay_distance_fm:.4f} * 10^-15 m = {decay_distance_m:.4e} m\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The calculated mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Comparing with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\")\nprint(\"B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\")\nprint(\"C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\")\nprint(\"D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe correct option is B.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
