    "My plan is to determine the correct option by analyzing the fundamental principles upon which the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is built.\n\n1.  **Analyze Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry (1, 2):** SMEFT extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators built from SM fields. A core assumption is that the underlying structure of spacetime is preserved. Therefore, the theory must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. Poincare symmetry encompasses both. All operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, so both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry are required.\n2.  **Analyze CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is formulated as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n3.  **Analyze CP Symmetry (3):** The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, most notably in the quark sector via the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is an effective theory of the full Standard Model, it is not required to respect CP symmetry. In fact, many of the higher-dimensional SMEFT operators can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). This corresponds to option B.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this reasoning and output the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_smeft_symmetries():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT\n    and prints the correct multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The question asks which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n    # 1.
