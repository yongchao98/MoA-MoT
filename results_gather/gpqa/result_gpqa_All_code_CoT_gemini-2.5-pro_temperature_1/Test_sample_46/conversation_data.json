    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get a clue about the structure.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (which accounts for 1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic sign of a primary amine (-NH2). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This specific frequency is typical for an ester, which is generally found between 1750-1715 cm-1. It is too high for a simple amide C=O.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet's downfield chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH2CH3), likely part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The signal is broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shift difference suggests the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   From the analysis, we have the following fragments: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Putting these pieces together gives us ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n    *   Let's check this against the options:\n        *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and it's a primary amide, not an ester.\n        *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n        *   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n        *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but it contains a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group. The NMR would be different (the quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm).\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data provided:\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = \"medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1; strong band at 1720 cm-1\"\n    nmr_data = \"1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"C\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n        \"D\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\"\n    }\n\n    # Step-by-step reasoning based on the data\n    analysis = [\n        \"1.
