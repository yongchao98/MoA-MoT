    "My plan is to solve this problem by first understanding the chemical transformation and then calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the resulting product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting molecule is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". I will determine its carbon skeleton and functional groups. It has a C6 ring (cyclohexene), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH2). The total number of carbon atoms is 10.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reagent is \"red phosphorus and excess of HI\". This is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups (like aldehydes and carboxylic acids) and all multiple bonds (like C=C double bonds) completely to their corresponding saturated alkane parts.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure:** The reaction will convert the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring, the formyl group to a methyl group, the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group, and the vinyl group to an ethyl group. The result is a saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original six-membered ring. The product is a substituted cyclohexane with a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):** The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of how many rings and pi (π) bonds are in a molecule. The formula is `IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π bonds)`.\n    *   Since the product is a substituted **cyclohexane**, it has **one ring**.\n    *   Since the reaction reduces all double bonds, the product is fully saturated and has **zero π bonds**.\n    *   Therefore, the IHD of the product will be 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that codifies this logic, calculates the IHD based on the product's structural features (1 ring, 0 pi bonds), and prints the final answer corresponding to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the reaction and its effect.\n    # The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI\n    # is a complete reduction.
