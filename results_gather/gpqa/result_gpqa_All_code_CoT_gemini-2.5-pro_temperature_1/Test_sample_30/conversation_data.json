    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the molecular symmetry of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nToluene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is the standard condition for the electrophilic aromatic nitration of a benzene ring. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an activating and ortho-, para-directing group. The reaction introduces a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the ring. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the para-substituted product is typically the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). MnO₂ is an oxidizing agent, particularly effective for oxidizing benzylic positions. Under these conditions, the benzylic methyl group is oxidized. While complete oxidation to a carboxylic acid is possible, a more common and selective transformation, especially in the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, is the oxidation to an aldehyde. An aldehyde is required for the subsequent standard reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These are the conditions for a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation.\n1.  Sodium hydroxide (a base) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion.\n2.  The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense).\n3.  The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under the reaction conditions to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\nThe final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, has the following structure: a 4-nitrophenyl group attached to a but-3-en-2-one chain (`p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃`).\nTo determine its molecular symmetry group, we look for its symmetry elements:\n*   **Rotational Axes (Cₙ, n>1):** The molecule is not symmetrical enough to have any rotational axes. Rotating it by any angle other than 360° does not result in an identical structure.\n*   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion. For example, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group does not have a corresponding atom on the opposite side of the molecule's center.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry. This plane contains the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, the carbonyl carbon, and the carbonyl oxygen. In a low-energy conformation, the atoms of the nitro group can also lie in this plane, and the methyl group can be oriented so that one of its hydrogen atoms is in the plane, with the other two located symmetrically above and below it.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ):** Since there are no Cₙ (n>1) axes, there are no Sₙ (n>1) axes.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# The user wants to find the molecular symmetry group of a final product from a 3-step reaction.\n\n# Step 1: Nitration of toluene\n# Reactants: Toluene, Nitric Acid (HNO3), Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4)\n# Reaction: Electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration).
