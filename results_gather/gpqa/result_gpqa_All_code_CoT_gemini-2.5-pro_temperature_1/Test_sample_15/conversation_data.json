    "To determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to analyze the structure of each molecule to see if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains one or more chiral centers and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has the structure `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The presence of R/S notation indicates that the molecule has defined stereocenters and is a single, specific stereoisomer. Such a molecule is chiral unless it happens to be a meso compound. Given the complexity of this bridged system and its specific designation, it is chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on C2 and C3 are identical (H, CH3, COOH). The `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. It is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule also has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. With the `(2R,3R)` configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)-` designation in the name explicitly states that the molecule is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. The chiral center is C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. It is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through C1 and C4). Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.
