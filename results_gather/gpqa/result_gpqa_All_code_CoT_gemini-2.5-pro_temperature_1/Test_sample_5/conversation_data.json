    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this quantum mechanics problem:\n\n1.  **Transform Coordinates:** The potential V(r, θ) is given in polar coordinates. The first step is to convert it into Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the relations `x = r*cos(θ)` and `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`. This often simplifies the potential's structure.\n2.  **Separate the Potential:** After converting, I will check if the potential `V(x, y)` can be separated into a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on `x` and the other only on `y`, i.e., `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`.\n3.  **Identify the System:** If the potential separates as described, the system is equivalent to two independent one-dimensional quantum systems. I will identify the form of `V_x(x)` and `V_y(y)`, which are expected to be simple harmonic oscillator potentials.\n4.  **Determine Energy Spectrum:** For a standard 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential `V(z) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * z^2`, the energy eigenvalues are `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`. I will determine the effective angular frequencies `ω_x` and `ω_y` for our system.\n5.  **Calculate Total Energy:** The total energy `E` of the 2D system will be the sum of the energies of the two independent 1D oscillators, `E = E_nx + E_ny`.\n6.  **Select the Answer:** Finally, I will simplify the total energy expression and compare it with the given options to find the correct one.\n\nHere is the python code that carries out the final step of selecting and printing the correct answer based on this derivation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# The plan is to derive the energy spectrum by first converting the potential\n# to Cartesian coordinates and then identifying it as two independent\n# quantum harmonic oscillators (QHOs).\n\n# Step 1: Define the potential and coordinate transformations.\n# V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n# x = r*cos(θ), r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n# Step 2: Convert to Cartesian coordinates.\n# V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (r*cos(θ))^2\n# V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n# V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n# V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n# Step 3: Identify the independent oscillators.\n# The potential is V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y) with:\n# V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n# V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n# This represents two independent 1D QHOs.\n\n# Step 4: Find the angular frequencies (ω).\n# The standard QHO potential is V_std(z) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * z^2.\n# For the x-direction: 1/2 * m * ω_x^2 = 2k  =>  ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m)\n# For the y-direction: 1/2 * m * ω_y^2 = 1/2 k =>  ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n# Step 5: Find the total energy spectrum.\n# The energy of a QHO is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n# The total energy is E = E_nx + E_ny.\n# E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n# E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2*sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ(sqrt(k/m))\n# E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n# E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n# E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n# Step 6: Compare with the options.\n# The derived expression matches option C.\n\nprint(\"The derivation shows the energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m).\")\nprint(\"Comparing this with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\")\nprint(\"B) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\")\nprint(\"C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\")\nprint(\"D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct option is C.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
