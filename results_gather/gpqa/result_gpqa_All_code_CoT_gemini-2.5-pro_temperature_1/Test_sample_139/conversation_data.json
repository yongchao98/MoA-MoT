    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical riddle and perform the calculation:\n\n**1. Identifying Substance X:**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope...\" and \"...used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This points towards a common reagent where isotopic labeling is used, such as a deuterated compound. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common reagent, and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits this description perfectly.\n*   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n    *   LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's assume Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n    *   The gas released (W) is Deuterium gas (D₂). A Deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n*   **Clue 3: \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B...is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K), which is very close to 277 K. So, B is D₂O.\n    *   From the reaction above, the products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble) and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, a precipitate). So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (Aluminum deuteroxide) causes decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases B (D₂O), confirming the identification.\n*   **Clue 4: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols (-OH).\n    *   The reaction product would be a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). This resulting molecule contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nBased on all clues, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n**2. Performing the Calculation:**\n\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n*   We need to find the lightest and heaviest elements present. Based on atomic mass, the lightest element is Hydrogen (as Deuterium) and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n*   The question asks for the *cumulative atomic masses* of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula. We'll use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Lightest element (Deuterium, D or ²H):** Its mass number is 2. The formula LiAlD₄ contains 4 Deuterium atoms.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum, Al):** Its most stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27. The formula contains 1 Aluminum atom.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 * 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative mass:** Sum of the total masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the elements and their isotopes in Substance X (LiAlD4).\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n# The other element is Lithium (Li).\n\n# Step 2: Define the mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D, or 2H) is 2.\n# Mass number of the most stable isotope of Aluminum (27Al) is 27.\n\n# Step 3: Count the number of atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula LiAlD4.\nnum_deuterium_atoms = 4\nnum_aluminum_atoms = 1\n\n# Step 4: Define the mass numbers.\nmass_of_deuterium = 2\nmass_of_aluminum = 27\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element.\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_deuterium_atoms * mass_of_deuterium\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element.\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_aluminum_atoms * mass_of_aluminum\n\n# Step 7: Calculate the cumulative mass by summing the two totals.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\n# Step 8: Print the final result.\nprint(f\"The lightest element is Deuterium (D). Total mass from 4 D atoms = {total_mass_lightest}\")\nprint(f\"The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al). Total mass from 1 Al atom = {total_mass_heaviest}\")\nprint(f\"The cumulative atomic mass is {total_mass_lightest} + {total_mass_heaviest} = {cumulative_mass}\")\nprint(\"The correct choice is B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
