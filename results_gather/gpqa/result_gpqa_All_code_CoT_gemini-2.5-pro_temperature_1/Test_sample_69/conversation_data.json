    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this chemical riddle:\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will break down each piece of information provided in the reaction scheme to identify the unknown substances A through H. The most diagnostic clues are often the specific reaction conditions, product properties (like color), and stoichiometries.\n2.  **Focus on the Hydrolysis Reaction:** The reaction `C + H2O -> A + F + G` is particularly informative. The fact that solid A is reformed suggests A is an element. The formation of two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G), strongly constrains the chemical composition of substance C, and by extension, substance B. The pair of a strong acid and a weak acid points towards a complex species that hydrolyzes into multiple components. A well-fitting pair is a strong fluoro-acid (F) and weak hydrofluoric acid (G, HF).\n3.  **Identify the Core Reactants:** Based on the hydrolysis products, I'll deduce the identities of A, B, and C. The first reaction, `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)`, involves some unusual features (like the \"8 equivalents\") which may be a red herring or a typo, but the other properties (solid A, gaseous B, bright red C) are key. A classic reaction from the history of noble gas chemistry fits these descriptions perfectly.\n    *   A = Xenon (Xe). The clue \"solid A\" is a known misleading part of this riddle; Xenon is solid at low temperatures.\n    *   B = Platinum hexafluoride (PtF6), a red gas.\n    *   C = [XeF]+[PtF6]-, the first synthesized noble gas compound, which is a bright red/orange solid. This is formed from `Xe + PtF6 -> [XeF]+[PtF6]-`.\n    *   This assignment fits the hydrolysis: `[XeF]+[PtF6]-` hydrolyzes to reform **A (Xe)**, **F (fluoroplatinic acid, H2PtF6, a strong acid)**, and **G (hydrofluoric acid, HF, a weak acid)**.\n4.  **Identify the Remaining Substances:** Now I will identify D and the final product E.\n    *   The reaction is `C + 2D -> E (extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Given the context of fluorine chemistry, a plausible candidate for the gaseous reactant **D** is **Fluorine (F2)**.\n    *   The reaction is `[XeF]+[PtF6]- (C) + 2F2 (D) -> XeF4 + PtF6`. This regenerates B (PtF6) and produces **E = Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)**.\n    *   XeF4 is a powerful fluorinating agent that reacts violently with water, so it fits the description \"extremely hazardous\". The stoichiometry `C + 2D` also works.\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The final step is to find the point group of E = XeF4.\n    *   Using VSEPR theory, Xe has 8 valence electrons, plus 4 from the fluorine atoms, for a total of 12 electrons, or 6 electron pairs.\n    *   These 6 pairs have an octahedral arrangement.\n    *   There are 4 bonding pairs (to F atoms) and 2 lone pairs.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the lone pairs occupy opposite (axial) positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into the equatorial positions.\n    *   This results in a **square planar** molecular geometry for XeF4.\n6.  **Assign the Point Group:** The point group for a square planar molecule of the type AX4 is **D4h**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry riddle by identifying the compounds and determining the symmetry of product E.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze clues, especially the hydrolysis reaction.\n    # The hydrolysis C + H2O -> A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid) is key.\n    # The products point to F = H2PtF6 (strong) and G = HF (weak), which means A is Xe.\n    A = \"Xe (Xenon)\"\n    F = \"H2PtF6 (Fluoroplatinic acid, strong)\"\n    G = \"HF (Hydrofluoric acid, weak)\"\n\n    # Step 3: Identify B and C based on the first reaction and the identities from hydrolysis.\n    # The reaction is the famous synthesis of the first noble gas compound by Neil Bartlett.\n    # Xe (A) + PtF6 (B) -> [XeF]+[PtF6]- (C)\n    B = \"PtF6 (Platinum hexafluoride, a red gas)\"\n    C = \"[XeF]+[PtF6]- (a bright red solid)\"\n    \n    # Step 4: Identify D and E.\n    # C + 2D -> E (extremely hazardous).\n    # Based on the chemical system, D is fluorine gas.\n    # [XeF]+[PtF6]- (C) + 2F2 (D) -> XeF4 (E) + PtF6 (B)\n    D = \"F2 (Fluorine gas)\"\n    E_identity = \"XeF4 (Xenon tetrafluoride)\"\n\n    # Step 5 & 6: Determine the molecular geometry and point group of E (XeF4).\n    # VSEPR theory predicts XeF4 to be square planar.\n    # A central atom (Xe) is bonded to four identical atoms (F) in a plane.\n    # There are two lone pairs on the central atom, above and below the plane.\n    # This geometry belongs to the D4h point group.\n    molecular_geometry_of_E = \"Square Planar\"\n    point_group_of_E = \"D4h\"\n\n    # The options provided are:\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C2\",\n        \"B\": \"D∞h\",\n        \"C\": \"C2v\",\n        \"D\": \"D4h\"\n    }\n    \n    final_answer_choice = \"D\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step deduction:\")\n    print(f\"1.
