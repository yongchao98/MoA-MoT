    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Write the Dissociation Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $CaY^{2-}$, dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant (K_f):** The problem gives the formation constant, $K_{f}$, for the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    $K_{f} = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an Equilibrium Table (ICE Table):** Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ at equilibrium. Since the complex dissociates in a 1:1 ratio, the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ will also be 'x'. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.\n    *   **Initial:** $[CaY^{2-}] = 0.02$ M, $[Ca^{2+}] = 0$, $[Y^{4-}] = 0$\n    *   **Change:** $[CaY^{2-}] = -x$, $[Ca^{2+}] = +x$, $[Y^{4-}] = +x$\n    *   **Equilibrium:** $[CaY^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$, $[Ca^{2+}] = x$, $[Y^{4-}] = x$\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve for x:** Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be very small compared to the initial concentration. Therefore, we can approximate $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}}$\n    The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nK_formation = 5e10\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_formation = [Complex] / ([Ca2+][EDTA4-])\n# At equilibrium, [Complex] = initial_complex_conc - x\n# [Ca2+] = x\n# [EDTA4-] = x\n# So, K_formation = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n\n# Since K_formation is very large, x will be very small.\n# We can approximate (initial_complex_conc - x) to initial_complex_conc.\n# K_formation ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# x^2 ≈ initial_complex_conc / K_formation\n# x = sqrt(initial_complex_conc / K_formation)\n\n# Calculate x, which is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nca_ion_concentration_sq = initial_complex_conc / K_formation\nca_ion_concentration = math.sqrt(ca_ion_concentration_sq)\n\n# Print the options and the result\nprint(\"What is the concentration of calcium ions?\")\nprint(\"A) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(\"B) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"C) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\nprint(\"D) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {ca_ion_concentration:.2e} M\")\n\n# Find the closest option\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 6.3e-7,\n    \"B\": 2.0e-2,\n    \"C\": 5.0e-3,\n    \"D\": 1.0e-2\n}\n\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - ca_ion_concentration))\nprint(f\"The calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer: The concentration of calcium ions is {ca_ion_concentration:.1e} M, which corresponds to option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
