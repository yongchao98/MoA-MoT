    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** Radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. We can simply calculate the probability of a fresh atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n2.  **Find the Decay Constant (λ):** The probability of decay `P(t)` within a time `t` is given by the formula `P(t) = 1 - exp(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to solve for `λ`.\n    *   `0.32 = 1 - exp(-λ * 100)`\n    *   `exp(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n    *   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n3.  **Calculate the New Probability:** Now, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. We use the same formula with `t = 150` and the value of `λ` we just found.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)`\n4.  **Execute in Python:** We will perform these calculations using Python's `math` library, print the final probability as a percentage, and compare it with the given choices.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given information\n# Probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%\np_decay_100 = 0.32\ntime1 = 100  # in minutes\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the decay constant (lambda)\n# The probability of survival is 1 - p_decay_100 = 0.68\n# The formula for survival is P_survival(t) = exp(-lambda * t)\n# So, 0.68 = exp(-lambda * 100)\n# Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(0.68) = -lambda * 100\n# Solving for lambda: lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100\nlambda_const = -math.log(1 - p_decay_100) / time1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the fact that 50 minutes have passed is irrelevant.\n# We just need to calculate the probability of decay over a 150-minute interval.\ntime2 = 150  # in minutes\np_decay_150 = 1 - math.exp(-lambda_const * time2)\n\n# Convert the probability to a percentage\np_decay_150_percent = p_decay_150 * 100\n\n# Step 4: Print the results and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated decay probability in 150 minutes is: {p_decay_150_percent:.2f}%\\n\")\nprint(\"Comparing this with the given choices:\")\nprint(f\"A) 40%\")\nprint(f\"B) 44%\")\nprint(f\"C) 48%\")\nprint(f\"D) 52%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to 44%.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
