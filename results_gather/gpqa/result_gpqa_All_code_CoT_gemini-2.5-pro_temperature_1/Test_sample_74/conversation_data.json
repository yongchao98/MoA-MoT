  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the provided DNA sequence to understand why the protein is not being expressed. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Inspect the Start of the Sequence:** I will check the beginning of the sequence for the standard start codon (ATG) and the sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which corresponds to the DNA sequence TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC.\n2.  **Translate the DNA Sequence:** I will translate the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence codon by codon (in groups of three nucleotides).\n3.  **Identify the Problem:** I will look for any anomalies in the translated sequence, specifically for premature stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA), which would halt protein synthesis.\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** Based on the findings from the translation, I will determine which of the given options (A, B, C, or D) correctly describes the issue.\n\nLet's execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_biology_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a DNA sequence to find the reason for failed protein expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The provided DNA sequence for the construct\n    dna_sequence = \"ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA\"\n\n    # Standard DNA codon table\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L', 'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGG':'W',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y',\n        'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_', 'TGA':'_STOP_'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the DNA sequence by translating it into an amino acid sequence:\")\n    print(\"5'-\" + dna_sequence + \"-3'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Translation:\")\n\n    protein_sequence = []\n    problem_found = False\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence), 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        if len(codon) == 3:\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, '?')\n            protein_sequence.append(f\"{codon}({amino_acid})\")\n            if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n                problem_found = True\n                break\n\n    print(\" -> \".join(protein_sequence))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    if problem_found:\n        print(\"Conclusion: A 'TGA' stop codon was found very early in the sequence, right after the HA tag.\")\n        print(\"This premature stop codon will cause the ribosome to detach and terminate translation, preventing the synthesis of the full-length GADD45G protein.\")\n        print(\"\\nEvaluating the options:\")\n        print(\"A) The ribosome terminated the translation early. - This is consistent with our finding of a premature stop codon.\")\n        print(\"B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. - The stop codon is TGA (UGA in mRNA), and stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs.\")\n        print(\"C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. - This cannot be determined from the sequence alone, and the premature stop codon is a more direct cause.\")\n        print(\"D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. - The HA tag sequence is translated correctly (YPYDVPDYA).
