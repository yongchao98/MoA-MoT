    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**: We have two frames of reference: the supernova ejecta's frame (the moving frame) and the Galaxy's frame (the stationary frame).\n2.  **Identify the Given Information**:\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time), `t_proper = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `299,792.458 km/s`.\n3.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation**: According to the theory of special relativity, time passes differently for observers in different frames of reference that are moving relative to each other. An observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval (`t_galaxy`) than the time measured in the ejecta's frame (`t_proper`). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n4.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame**: The time dilation formula is:\n    `t_galaxy = t_proper / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    We will calculate `t_galaxy` using the given values.\n5.  **Calculate the Distance**: The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the *Galaxy's reference frame*. We can calculate this using the classic distance formula, `distance = speed × time`, but we must use the time as measured in the Galaxy's frame (`t_galaxy`).\n    `distance = v * t_galaxy`\n6.  **Compare the Result**: The calculated distance will be compared with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the known values from the problem statement.\n# v is the relative velocity in km/s.\nv = 60000.0  # km/s\n# t_proper is the time elapsed in the moving reference frame (the ejecta) in seconds.\nt_proper = 50.0  # s\n# c is the speed of light in km/s.\nc = 299792.458  # km/s\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (t_galaxy)\n# using the time dilation formula.\n# t_galaxy = t_proper / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\ntime_dilation_factor = math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c**2))\nt_galaxy = t_proper / time_dilation_factor\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n# distance = velocity * time_in_galaxy_frame\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * t_galaxy\n\n# Step 4: Print the calculated distance and the given options for comparison.\nprint(f\"The time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame is: {t_galaxy:.4f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is: {distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f} km.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3 060 000 km\")\nprint(\"B) 2 940 000 km\")\nprint(\"C) 2 880 000 km\")\nprint(\"D) 3 000 000 km\")\n\n# The calculated value is approximately 3,061,962 km, which is closest to option A.\n# Let's show the calculation if c was rounded to 300,000 km/s, as is common in such problems.\nc_approx = 300000.0 # km/s\ntime_dilation_factor_approx = math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c_approx**2))\nt_galaxy_approx = t_proper / time_dilation_factor_approx\ndistance_approx = v * t_galaxy_approx\nprint(f\"\\nFor c ≈ 300,000 km/s, the distance is: {distance_approx:.0f} km.\")\nprint(\"This result is also very close to option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
