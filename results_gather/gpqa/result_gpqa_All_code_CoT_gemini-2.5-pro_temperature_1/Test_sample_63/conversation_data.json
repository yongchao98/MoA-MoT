    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** First, we'll use the information from the experiment to determine the chemical nature and quantity (in moles) of the gases produced by heating the salt mixture.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The weight increase in the tube with red-hot copper corresponds to the mass of oxygen (O₂) produced.\n    *   The fact that the Ca(OH)₂ tube's weight did not change means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n    *   The remaining gas, C, which is inert to all previous traps, is most likely nitrogen (N₂). We can calculate its moles from the given volume at STP.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactants (Salts A and B):** Based on the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂), we can deduce the original salts. The absence of a solid residue and the production of these specific gases strongly suggest the decomposition of two ammonium salts:\n    *   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to N₂ + 2H₂O.\n    *   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposes to N₂ + 0.5 O₂ + 2H₂O (this is one of its decomposition pathways, which fits the products).\n\n3.  **Verify with Stoichiometry:** We'll assume the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ and that they were in an equimolar mixture. We can calculate the moles of each salt (`n`) using the moles of any of the products (e.g., N₂). Then, we will use this value of `n` to predict the quantities of the other products (O₂ and H₂O) and the total initial mass of the mixture. If our predictions match the experimental data, our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Once salts A and B are confirmed to be NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃, we will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt. The sum of these two numbers will be our final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define given data and constants\nmass_h2o = 3.60  # g, from tube #1\nmass_o2 = 0.80   # g, from tube #3\nvolume_gas_c = 2.24  # L at STP, this is N2 gas\n\nMOLAR_MASS_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nMOLAR_MASS_O2 = 31.998   # g/mol\nMOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of products\n# The problem states that the final remaining gas is 2.24 L.\n# Based on the likely reactions, this inert gas is Nitrogen (N2).\nmoles_n2 = volume_gas_c / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n# We hypothesize the salts are Ammonium Nitrite (A) and Ammonium Nitrate (B),\n# as their decomposition produces the observed gases (N2, H2O, O2) without solid residue.\n# Reaction A: NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O\n# Reaction B: 2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O (or per mole: NH4NO3 -> N2 + 0.5*O2 + 2*H2O)\n\n# Step 3: Use stoichiometry to find the moles of the original salts\n# The mixture is equimolar, so moles of A = moles of B = n.\n# Total moles of N2 produced = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n# So, 2 * n = moles_n2\nn = moles_n2 / 2\n\n# We can verify this value of 'n' using the other products.\n# Predicted moles of O2 = 0.5 * n (only from B)\npredicted_mass_o2 = (0.5 * n) * MOLAR_MASS_O2\n\n# Predicted moles of H2O = 2*n (from A) + 2*n (from B) = 4*n\npredicted_mass_h2o = (4 * n) * MOLAR_MASS_H2O\n\n# We check if our calculated masses match the experimental data.\n# Note: due to rounding of molar masses, the result might be a close approximation.\n# moles_n2 is 0.1, so n is 0.05.\n# predicted_mass_o2 = 0.5 * 0.05 * 31.998 = 0.79995 g (~0.80 g) -> Match!\n# predicted_mass_h2o = 4 * 0.05 * 18.015 = 3.603 g (~3.60 g) -> Match!\n\n# Since the product amounts match, our identification of the salts is correct.\n# Salt A = NH4NO2 (Ammonium Nitrite)\n# Salt B = NH4NO3 (Ammonium Nitrate)\n\n# Step 4: Count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n# Atoms in Salt A (NH4NO2):\n# N: 1 (in NH4) + 1 (in NO2) = 2\n# H: 4\n# O: 2\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Atoms in Salt B (NH4NO3):\n# N: 1 (in NH4) + 1 (in NO3) = 2\n# H: 4\n# O: 3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# The total number of atoms is the sum of atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B.\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is:\")\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
