    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The key relationship is between the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) and the properties of the star-planet system.\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (let's call it Kλ) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (usually denoted as K). So, `Kλ ∝ K`.\n3.  **Relate Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`m_p`), star's mass (`M_star`), and orbital period (`P`) by the formula: `K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`.\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship:** The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). We can also assume the unstated orbital inclinations are the same. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`.\n5.  **Combine the Proportions:** Since `Kλ ∝ K` and `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`, it follows that `Kλ ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`.\n6.  **Formulate an Equation:** This proportionality means that the product `Kλ * P^(1/3)` is constant for both systems. So, `Kλ1 * P1^(1/3) = Kλ2 * P2^(1/3)`.\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We need to find `P2 / P1`. Rearranging the equation:\n    *   `P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = Kλ1 / Kλ2`\n    *   `(P2 / P1)^(1/3) = Kλ1 / Kλ2`\n    *   `P2 / P1 = (Kλ1 / Kλ2)^3`\n8.  **Calculate the Result:** I will plug in the given values (`Kλ1 = 5` miliangstrom, `Kλ2 = 7` miliangstrom) into this final formula and calculate the ratio. The result will then be compared to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (K_lambda) is inversely\n# proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (P), assuming star\n# and planet masses are constant.\n# K_lambda ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n# Therefore, K_lambda1 * P1^(1/3) = K_lambda2 * P2^(1/3)\n# We want to find the ratio P2 / P1.\n# (P2 / P1)^(1/3) = K_lambda1 / K_lambda2\n# P2 / P1 = (K_lambda1 / K_lambda2)^3\n\n# Given values for the periodic wavelength shifts in miliangstroms\nshift_1 = 5.0\nshift_2 = 7.0\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1\nperiod_ratio = (shift_1 / shift_2) ** 3\n\n# Print the final result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 is: {period_ratio}\")\nprint(\"\\nWhich of the following choices is the closest?\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 0.85\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 1.96\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 1.40\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 0.36\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
