    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`, where `T_star` is the star's effective temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`), we can divide their respective formulas. Since the star's properties (`T_star`, `R_star`) and the albedo (`A`) are the same for both planets, these terms cancel out, leaving the simplified relation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given, but we can determine it from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum RV shift of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude `K`, is related to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` by `K = c * Δλ / λ0`. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by both transit and RV methods (implying an edge-on view, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`), the RV semi-amplitude is also given by:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`, where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    `a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`.\n    Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Substitute Doppler Shifts:** The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio of their corresponding Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`. Substituting this into the equation for `a2 / a1` gives:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`.\n    We will now use Python to plug in the given values and compute the final ratio.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the planets\n# Mass of Planet1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nlambda_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the product of the mass ratio and the lambda ratio\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * lambda_ratio\n\n# Print the result and the available choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"The choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 0.98\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
