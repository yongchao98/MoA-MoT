    "This problem requires the evaluation of a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. This is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n### My Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field and Volume:** The vector field `f` is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and points in the radial direction. In vector form, `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the radial unit vector. The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:** The Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n3.  **Set up the Surface Integral:**\n    *   The surface `S` is the sphere of radius `r = R`.\n    *   On this surface, the vector field is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere points radially outward and is given by `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat` in spherical coordinates.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dot Product:** We compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = ( (1/R^2) * r_hat ) ⋅ ( R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat )`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:** Now, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Use Python for Calculation:** I will use Python's `sympy` library to perform this symbolic double integration to find the final numerical answer and then match it with the given options.\n\n*Note*: A direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` gives 0 for `r > 0`. However, the field is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the divergence at this point is a Dirac delta function. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity by converting the problem into a surface integral on the boundary, where the field is well-behaved.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import sin, pi, integrate\n\n# Step 1: Define the symbolic variables for spherical coordinates.\ntheta, phi = sympy.symbols('theta phi')\n\n# Step 2: Define the integrand for the surface integral.\n# As derived from the Divergence Theorem, the dot product f ⋅ dS simplifies to sin(θ).\n# The integral is ∫∫ sin(θ) dθ dφ.\nintegrand = sin(theta)\n\n# Step 3: Perform the integration.\n# First, integrate with respect to theta from 0 to pi.\nintegral_over_theta = integrate(integrand, (theta, 0, pi))\n\n# Second, integrate the result with respect to phi from 0 to 2*pi.\ntotal_integral_value = integrate(integral_over_theta, (phi, 0, 2*pi))\n\n# Step 4: Display the final answer and compare with the given choices.\nprint(\"The value of the volume integral of the divergence is calculated using the Divergence Theorem.\")\nprint(\"The resulting surface integral is ∫(φ=0 to 2π) ∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated result is: {total_integral_value}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nNow, let's evaluate the given choices:\")\nchoice_A = 4 * pi\nchoice_B = 1\n# Choice C is symbolic, it depends on R.
