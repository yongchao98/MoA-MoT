    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to understand the relationship between the energy of emitted light and absorbed light. A molecule absorbs light of a certain energy to get into an excited state. It then relaxes and emits light of a *lower* energy (longer wavelength). This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n2.  The problem provides the energy of the *emitted* light (2.3393 eV). My first step is to calculate the wavelength of this emitted light to determine its color.\n3.  The formula to relate energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. I will rearrange this to λ = hc/E.\n4.  I will convert the energy from electron-volts (eV) to Joules (J) to use standard units for the constants.\n5.  After calculating the wavelength of the emitted light in nanometers, I will identify its color using the visible light spectrum.\n6.  According to the Stokes shift principle, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and, therefore, a shorter wavelength than the emitted light.\n7.  I will then evaluate the given options (Blue, Yellow, Red, Violet) to see which ones have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted light.\n8.  Finally, I will select the most plausible answer. Typically, the absorption peak is spectrally close to the emission peak, just at a higher energy. The color with the next shortest wavelength compared to the emitted color is the most likely answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_dye_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the color of light absorbed by a dye given the energy of the emitted light.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define constants\n    E_eV = 2.3393  # Energy of emitted light in eV\n    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J*s\n    c = 2.99792458e8  # Speed of light in m/s\n    e = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in C (for eV to J conversion)\n\n    # Step 2: Convert energy from eV to Joules\n    E_joules = E_eV * e\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light\n    lambda_meters = (h * c) / E_joules\n    lambda_nm = lambda_meters * 1e9\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the color of the emitted light\n    emitted_color = \"\"\n    if 400 <= lambda_nm < 450:\n        emitted_color = \"Violet\"\n    elif 450 <= lambda_nm < 495:\n        emitted_color = \"Blue\"\n    elif 495 <= lambda_nm < 570:\n        emitted_color = \"Green\"\n    elif 570 <= lambda_nm < 590:\n        emitted_color = \"Yellow\"\n    elif 590 <= lambda_nm < 620:\n        emitted_color = \"Orange\"\n    elif 620 <= lambda_nm <= 750:\n        emitted_color = \"Red\"\n    \n    print(f\"1.
