    "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to analyze each structure for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This steric hindrance locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Let's analyze the structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon). The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of a center of inversion (or a plane of symmetry) makes the molecule achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomerism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds to determine which exhibit optical isomerism and prints the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis of each compound based on principles of stereochemistry\n    # 1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Chiral due to atropisomerism (hindered rotation).\n    # 2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Chiral due to a stereocenter (carbon bonded to 4 different groups).\n    # 3. benzophenone: Achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n    # 4. dimethyl fumarate: Achiral due to a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\n    optically_active_compounds = [\"1\", \"2\"]\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [\"3\", \"4\"],\n        \"B\": [\"2\", \"3\"],\n        \"C\": [\"1\", \"2\", \"4\"],\n        \"D\": [\"1\", \"2\"]\n    }\n\n    correct_option = \"\"\n    for option, compounds in options.items():\n        # Check if the set of compounds in the option matches the set of optically active compounds\n        if set(compounds) == set(optically_active_compounds):\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    print(\"The compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\n    print(\"<<<\" + correct_option + \">>>\")\n\nsolve_isomerism_question()\n```"
