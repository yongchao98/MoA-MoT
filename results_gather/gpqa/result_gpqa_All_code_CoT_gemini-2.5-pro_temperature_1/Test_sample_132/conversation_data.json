    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles:** First, we calculate the number of moles for each salt added to the solution.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / molar mass\n2.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:** We then find the initial concentrations of the conjugate acid (H2PO4-) and conjugate base (HPO4^2-) by dividing the moles of each by the total volume of the solution in liters.\n3.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**: The solution is a buffer system composed of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. This pair is related by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2. We can use the equilibrium expression for Ka2 to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+].\n    *   Equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   From this, we can solve for [H+].\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**: The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is produced from the dissociation of HPO4^2-, which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka3.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4^3-], using the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-].\n\nNow, let's implement these steps in Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nvolume_cm3 = 200.00\nvolume_L = volume_cm3 / 1000.0  # Convert cm3 to L\n\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of each component\n# KH2PO4 provides the H2PO4- ion (conjugate acid)\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n\n# Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the HPO4^2- ion (conjugate base)\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# From the equilibrium H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# From the equilibrium HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the result and the options\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is: {conc_PO4_3minus:.3e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nOptions:\")\nprint(f\"A) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\noptions = {\n    'A': 5.48e-7,\n    'B': 2.81e-7,\n    'C': 6.24e-7,\n    'D': 3.97e-7\n}\n\nclosest_option = min(options.keys(), key=lambda option: abs(options[option] - conc_PO4_3minus))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
