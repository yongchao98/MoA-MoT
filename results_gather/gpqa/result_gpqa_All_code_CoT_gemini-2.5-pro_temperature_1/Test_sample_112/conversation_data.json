    "Here is my thinking process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid due to its extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the region for a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, as vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of an alkene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very strong indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total = 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined data points to a molecule that is a **carboxylic acid** and also contains an **alkene**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates choices C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they only have one oxygen.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate the Remaining Choices:**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   Our molecule has a C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have a DoU of at least 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This molecule only has one degree of unsaturation, which is not enough for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n        *   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of a two-oxygen functional group (carboxylic acid) and the requirement for two degrees of unsaturation (for the C=O and C=C bonds), the only possible formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct molecular formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the functional groups from the provided data.\n    # FTIR: broad peak at 3000 cm-1 (O-H of carboxylic acid), 1700 cm-1 (C=O), 1650 cm-1 (C=C).\n    # 1H NMR: Vinyl-hydrogens confirm a C=C bond.\n    # Mass Spec: Fragment at m/z = 45 confirms a COOH group.\n    # Conclusion from data: The compound is a carboxylic acid containing an alkene.\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\")\n    print(\" - FTIR and Mass Spec data indicate a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\")\n    print(\" - FTIR and 1H NMR data indicate an alkene (C=C) group.\")\n    print(\" - A carboxylic acid requires 2 oxygen atoms.
