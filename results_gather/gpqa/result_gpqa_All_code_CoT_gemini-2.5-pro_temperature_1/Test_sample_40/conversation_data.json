    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the physical setup**\nThis problem involves the addition of velocities in the framework of special relativity. We have two frames of reference:\n*   The **laboratory frame (S)**, where the observer is at rest.\n*   The **glass frame (S')**, which is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\nWe are given:\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is `c=1`.\n*   The index of refraction of the glass is `n`.\n*   The velocity of the glass relative to the observer is `v`.\n\n**2. Determine the speed of light within the glass frame (S')**\nThe index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u_medium`).\n`n = c / u_medium`\nTherefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest within the glass is:\n`u_medium = c / n`\nSince the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass frame is:\n`u = 1/n`\n\n**3. Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula**\nThe formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n`u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v / c^2)`\nwhere:\n*   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n*   `u` is the velocity of the object as seen in the moving frame (S'). Here, `u = 1/n`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S). Here, `v` is the velocity of the glass.\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum. Here, `c=1`.\n\n**4. Substitute the values and simplify**\nSubstitute `u = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n`u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n`u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n`u' = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u' = (n/n + n*v) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n`u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A. The following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform this symbolic calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for the variables\nn, v, c = sympy.symbols('n v c')\n\n# According to the problem, the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1\nc = 1\n\n# The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass, is u = c/n\nu = c / n\n\n# The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v / c**2)\n# Here, u' is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\nu_prime = (u + v) / (1 + u * v / c**2)\n\n# Simplify the expression\nsimplified_u_prime = sympy.simplify(u_prime)\n\n# The given options are:\n# A) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n# B) 1\n# C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n# D) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n# Let's create expressions for the options to compare\noption_a = (1 + n * v) / (n + v)\noption_b = 1\noption_c = (1 - n * v) / (n + v)\noption_d = (1 + n * v) / (n - v)\n\n# Print the derived result and the options\nprint(\"Derivation of the speed of light in the moving glass:\")\nprint(f\"Speed of light in the glass's rest frame (u): {u}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity of the glass (v): v\")\nprint(\"Applying the relativistic velocity addition formula u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v):\")\nprint(f\"Result u' = {simplified_u_prime}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) {option_a}\")\nprint(f\"B) {option_b}\")\nprint(f\"C) {option_c}\")\nprint(f\"D) {option_d}\")\n\n# Determine which option matches the result\nif simplified_u_prime == option_a:\n    correct_option = \"A\"\nelif simplified_u_prime == option_b:\n    correct_option = \"B\"\nelif simplified_u_prime == option_c:\n    correct_option = \"C\"\nelif simplified_u_prime == option_d:\n    correct_option = \"D\"\nelse:\n    correct_option = \"None of the above\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe derived result matches option: {correct_option}\")\nprint(\"<<<A>>>\")\n```"
