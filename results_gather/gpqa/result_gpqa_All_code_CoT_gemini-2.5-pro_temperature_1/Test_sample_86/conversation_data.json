    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   **Base Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means we start with a benzene ring (C6).\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** indicates one substituent contains this functional group.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond** means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain the C=O group and both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms. The only common and stable group that fits this is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   The structure is a haloacetophenone.\n\n**2. Determine the Substitution Pattern:**\n\nThe problem is to identify the correct 1H NMR data. Let's analyze the patterns given in the options.\n\n*   Options A and C show a pattern of `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm). This is a classic, simplified pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. Due to symmetry, the two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   Ortho or meta substitution would lead to more complex splitting patterns with potentially four distinct signals.\n\nBased on the options, the compound is **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** We expect two signals in the aromatic region (~7.0-8.0 ppm). Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, so the protons will be deshielded (shifted downfield). The pattern will be two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Acetyl Group Protons:** The `-COCH3` group has a methyl group. These 3 protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3 protons**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s) ... 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) ...**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons in the exact region expected for a methyl ketone.\n    *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for para-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d) ...**\n    *   Similar to B, the chemical shifts are not in the typical aromatic proton range. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The data in option C is the only one consistent with the structure deduced from the provided information.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided information to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n    \n    1.  **Deduce Structure:**\n        - Aromatic ring: 6 carbons.\n        - Total carbons: 8. So, substituents have 2 carbons.\n        - FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (C_ar-X).\n        - This means the substituents must be a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n        - The compound is a haloacetophenone.\n\n    2.  **Analyze NMR Pattern:**\n        - Options A and C show a '2H doublet, 2H doublet' pattern in the aromatic region. This is characteristic of a para-disubstituted ring.\n        - The structure is likely para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    3.  **Predict Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n        - Aromatic region: Two doublets, each for 2H.\n        - Acetyl group: The -CH3 group is next to a C=O, so it will be a singlet for 3H, typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n    4.  **Evaluate Options:**\n        - A: Has an aldehyde peak at 9.9 ppm. Incorrect.\n        - B: Aromatic shifts are incorrect. Incorrect.\n        - C: Has two doublets (2H each) in the aromatic region and a singlet (3H) at 2.3 ppm. This is a perfect match.\n        - D: Aromatic shifts are incorrect. Incorrect.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    correct_choice = \"C\"\n    explanation = \"The compound is para-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum should show two doublets in the aromatic region for the para-substituted ring protons, and one singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl group's methyl. Option C is the only choice that matches this prediction.\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the molecular information and NMR options...\")\n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"The correct choice is: {correct_choice}\")\n    \nsolve_nmr_problem()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
