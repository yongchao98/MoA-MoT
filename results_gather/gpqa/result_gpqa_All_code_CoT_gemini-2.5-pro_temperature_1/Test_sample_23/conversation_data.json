    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:** The most crucial piece of information is the mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) in hydrocarbon Z. Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it doesn't react further with hydrogen) formed by hydrogenating X and Y. Saturated hydrocarbons are either alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) or cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as (Total Mass of H) / (Total Molar Mass).\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ. Using atomic masses C=12 and H=1:\n        Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 2 / 14 = 1/7.\n    *   Converting 1/7 to a decimal gives approximately 0.142857, which is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. Since it's a common solvent, the most likely candidate is **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water (meaning they are saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Z (Cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z (Cyclohexane).\n    *   This means the other component of Y must also produce Cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene. The only common C₆ compound that fits this description is **Benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize Br₂ water under normal conditions, but it can be hydrogenated under severe conditions to form Cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water (meaning they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction catalyzed by platinum.\n    *   The overall reaction conserves atoms. The two molecules in mixture X react to form the two molecules in mixture Y.\n        X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂\n    *   Since all compounds are based on a C₆ skeleton, we can write the reaction in terms of their formulas:\n        C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₓ → C₆H₁₂ (Cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (Benzene)\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 (from Cyclohexane) + 6 (from Benzene) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18 (i.e., a + x = 18).\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms during the reaction, this total must be 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's confirm the identity of the liquids in X. They must be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₓ where a+x=18, both must be unsaturated, and have no conjugated bonds. The most plausible candidates are **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated (will decolorize Br₂ water).\n*   1,4-Cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexene has one double bond.\n*   In the reaction, the diene (C₆H₈) is oxidized to benzene (C₆H₆) by losing 2H, and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is reduced to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) by gaining 2H. This fits the description of a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n\nThe core logic relies on the conservation of atoms. The code below will calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the product mixture Y, which must be equal to the total in the reactant mixture X.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry puzzle by following a logical deduction process.\n    1.
