    "Here is my plan to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group on a benzene ring. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups (-COOH > -CHO > -CN > -OH > -NH2 > -OR). Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents:** I will place the substituents on the benzene ring according to the description.\n    *   **-COOH (Carboxylic acid):** At C1.\n    *   **-OCH3 (Methoxy):** *para* to the carboxylic acid, so it must be at **C4**.\n    *   **-CHO (Carbaldehyde/Formyl) and -CN (Cyano):** These are *meta* to one another and also *meta* to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This means they must be at positions C3 and C5.\n    *   **-OH (Hydroxyl) and -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino):** These are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid, meaning they are at positions C2 and C6.\n\n3.  **Resolve Ambiguities using All Clues:** The description provides an additional clue: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n    *   For the methoxy group (C4) to be *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be at either C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous placement.\n    *   For the alcohol (-OH) to also be *ortho* to the nitrile, we must test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C3:** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is already occupied by methoxy, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C2**.\n        *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C5:** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is already occupied by methoxy, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C6**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Lowest Locant Rule:** Now we have two possible structures. IUPAC rules state that we must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents. If the locant sets are identical, we give the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 1 (-CN at C3):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl) - by elimination of other meta position\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino) - by elimination of other ortho position\n        *   **Locant set:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2 (-CN at C5):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino) - by elimination of other ortho position\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl) - by elimination of other meta position\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   **Locant set:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\n5.  **Apply Alphabetical Tie-Breaker:** Since both numbering schemes give the identical locant set {2,3,4,5,6}, we must use alphabetical order to decide.\n    *   **Substituents in alphabetical order:** **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   **In Structure 1:** The first alphabetical group, cyano, is at C3.\n    *   **In Structure 2:** The first alphabetical group, cyano, is at C5.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Structure 1 is the correctly numbered molecule.**\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Name:** Using the positions from Structure 1 and arranging the substituents alphabetically:\n    *   3-cyano-\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n    *   5-formyl-\n    *   2-hydroxy-\n    *   4-methoxy-\n    *   ...benzoic acid\n\n    The full name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:** This name matches option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct IUPAC name for the given substituted benzene molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the principal functional group and parent molecule.\")\n    print(\"The highest priority functional group is carboxylic acid (-COOH).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the parent molecule is benzoic acid, and the -COOH is at position C1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine substituent positions based on the description.\")\n    print(\"C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\")\n    print(\"C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy), because it's para to C1.\")\n    print(\"C3/C5: -CHO (Formyl) and -CN (Cyano), because they are meta to C1.\")\n    print(\"C2/C6: -OH (Hydroxy) and -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino), because they are ortho to C1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Use the final clue to resolve the structure.\")\n    print(\"Clue: 'The methoxy (at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are also both ortho to the nitrile (-CN)'.\")\n    print(\"Possibility A: If -CN is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4.
