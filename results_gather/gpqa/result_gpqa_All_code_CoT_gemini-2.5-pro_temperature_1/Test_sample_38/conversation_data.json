    "To solve this problem, we will use a fundamental concept from quantum mechanics: the normalization of the wave function. The total probability of finding a particle within the entire space it can exist must be 1 (or 100%).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find the Probability Density Function:** The probability of finding the particle at a position `x` is related to the square of the magnitude of its wave function, `|ψ(x)|²`. The given wave function is `ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i`. This is a complex number of the form `Re + i*Im`, where the real part `Re = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and the imaginary part `Im = -0.5`. The squared magnitude is calculated as `|ψ(x)|² = Re² + Im²`.\n    `|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`.\n2.  **Apply the Normalization Condition:** The problem states the particle is only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. Therefore, the integral of the probability density function over this interval must equal 1.\n    `∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1`\n    `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n3.  **Solve the Integral:** We need to solve this definite integral.\n    `[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x]` evaluated from x=1 to x=3.\n    This evaluates to `(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)`.\n    Simplifying gives `a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5`, which further simplifies to `a² * ln(2) + 0.5`.\n4.  **Solve for 'a':** Now we set the result of the integral to 1 and solve for `a`.\n    `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n    `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`\n5.  **Calculate the value:** We will use Python to compute the numerical value of `a` and find the closest option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem requires finding the value of 'a' that normalizes the wave function.\n# The normalization condition leads to the equation: a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.\n# We solve this equation for 'a'.\n\n# Step 1: Isolate the a^2 term\n# a^2 * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n# a^2 * ln(2) = 0.5\n\n# Step 2: Solve for a^2\n# a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\n\n# Step 3: Solve for a by taking the square root\n# The constant 'a' is typically taken as a positive real number.\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\n# Print the calculated value of 'a'\nprint(f\"The calculated value of 'a' is: {a:.4f}\")\n\n# The given options are:\n# A) 1.1\n# B) 0.35\n# C) 0.85\n# D) 0.6\n\n# Compare the calculated value with the options provided.\n# The calculated value ~0.8493 is closest to 0.85.\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 1.1\")\nprint(\"B) 0.35\")\nprint(\"C) 0.85\")\nprint(\"D) 0.6\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
