    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Simplify the non-Gaussianity (nG) Formula**: The problem defines nG as `del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`. This is equivalent to `S(tau) - S(rho)`, where `S` is the von Neumann entropy. The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The entropy of any pure state is zero, so `S(rho) = 0`. This simplifies the problem to calculating `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Reference State `tau`**: The state `tau` is a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the state `rho = |psi><psi|`. The entropy `S(tau)` is completely determined by these moments.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moments of `rho`**: We need to calculate the second moments of `rho`, specifically the mean photon number `<n> = <psi|a^†a|psi>` and the squeezing parameter `<a^2> = <psi|a^2|psi>`. The first moment `<a_hat>` is zero for the given phase `phi = -pi/4`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Symplectic Eigenvalue `nu`**: The entropy of the Gaussian state `tau` is a function of its symplectic eigenvalue `nu`. For a single-mode state, `nu` can be calculated from the second moments using the formula: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Entropy `S(tau)`**: Once `nu` is found, the entropy `S(tau)` is calculated using the formula for a single-mode Gaussian state:\n    `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python**: The Python code will perform these calculations step-by-step to find the final numerical value for `nG`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_non_gaussianity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state.\n\n    The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N.\n    The non-Gaussianity is measured by the relative entropy to a reference\n    Gaussian state tau: nG = S(tau) - S(rho).\n    For a pure state |psi>, S(rho) = 0, so nG = S(tau).\n\n    The calculation proceeds as follows:\n    1. Define the parameters alpha and phi.\n    2. Calculate the second moments <n> and <a^2> for the state rho.\n    3. Use the moments to find the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu' of the\n       reference Gaussian state tau.\n    4. Calculate the von Neumann entropy S(tau) from 'nu'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
