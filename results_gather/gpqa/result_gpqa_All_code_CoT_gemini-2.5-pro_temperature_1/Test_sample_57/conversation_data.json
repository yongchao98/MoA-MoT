    "My approach is to evaluate each of the given physical theories based on the concept of regularization at high energies (also known as ultraviolet divergences).\n\n1.  **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** and **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** are both Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) that form the basis of the Standard Model of particle physics. A hallmark of calculations in QFT, particularly those involving loop diagrams, is the appearance of infinite results due to integrals diverging at high energies. To extract meaningful, finite physical predictions, a two-step process called regularization and renormalization is essential. Therefore, both QCD and QED *require* regularization.\n\n2.  **Classical Electrodynamics**, while not a quantum theory, has its own high-energy problem. The self-energy of a point-like charge is infinite, which indicates a breakdown of the theory at short distances (equivalent to high energies). This issue requires some form of \"regularization,\" such as assuming the charge has a finite, non-zero size.\n\n3.  **Superstring Theory** is a theoretical framework proposed as a candidate for a unified theory of everything, including quantum gravity. One of its most celebrated features is that it is believed to be free from ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. In string theory, point particles are replaced by one-dimensional extended objects called strings. This \"smears out\" the interactions, smoothing the singularities that cause divergences in point-particle QFTs. Consequently, Superstring Theory is thought to not require the ad-hoc process of regularization.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the correct answer. I will now write a Python script to present this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_physics_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided options to determine which physical theory\n    does not require regularization at high energies.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Quantum Chromodynamics',\n        'B': 'Quantum Electrodynamics',\n        'C': 'Classical Electrodynamics',\n        'D': 'Superstring Theory'\n    }\n\n    explanation = {\n        'A': 'Requires regularization.
