    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n**Reaction 1: Finding Product A**\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:** The reaction involves dimethyl malonate, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and a base (NaOEt). The base deprotonates the acidic α-hydrogen of dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `[-]CH(COOCH3)2`. This enolate is the Michael donor (nucleophile). The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester, is the Michael acceptor (electrophile).\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`. The attack forms a new C-C bond between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final stable product.\n4.  **Product Structure (A):** The final structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n5.  **Naming Product A:** This structure can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The propane chain is C1-C2-C3. The three methoxycarbonyl groups (`-COOCH3`) are at positions 1, 1, and 3, and the p-tolyl group is at position 2. Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Finding Product B**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis followed by a Michael addition. 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines serve as nucleophiles, equivalent to enolates.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enamine acts as the Michael donor, attacking the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine is the β-carbon of the double bond (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The workup with aqueous acid (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (regenerating the ketone) and protonates the α-carbon of the nitrile group.\n4.  **Product Structure (B):** The result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at C2 with a `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` group.\n5.  **Naming Product B:** Naming this structure with butanenitrile as the parent chain, the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is at position 3. The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product over the enol form.\n\n**Reaction 3: Finding Reactant C**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type (Retrosynthesis):** We are given the product of a Michael addition and the Michael acceptor, and we need to find the Michael donor (reactant C).\n2.  **Analyze Product and Acceptor:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). After addition and protonation, MVK becomes the `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3`).\n3.  **Identify Donor C:** Since the `3-oxobutyl` group came from MVK, the rest of the molecule, the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton, must have come from the Michael donor, C. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2 (between the two carbonyls) of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate that attacks MVK.\n4.  **Structure of C:** Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n# Reaction 1: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate -> A\n# Nucleophile (donor): Enolate of dimethyl malonate, [-]CH(COOMe)2\n# Electrophile (acceptor): methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe\n# The nucleophile attacks the beta-carbon of the acceptor.\n# Product (A) structure: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)2)-CH2-COOMe\n# IUPAC name for A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n# This eliminates options B and C.\n\n# Reaction 2: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile -> B\n# This is a Stork enamine alkylation, a type of Michael addition.\n# Donor: Enamine from cyclohexanone.
