    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Operator in the Given Direction:** First, I will construct the operator $\\vec{P}$ for the spin along the arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its general form is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the z-axis. The operator is then $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$. I will use the given matrix representations for $P_x$ and $P_z$.\n\n2.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:** The core of the problem is to solve the eigenvalue equation $P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$. We are given the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$ and we need to find the corresponding eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Eigenvector:** I will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`, to construct the matrix for $P_{\\vec{n}}$ and then use its built-in functions to find its eigenvectors.\n\n4.  **Isolate and Simplify:** The `sympy` library will return eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. I will select the eigenvector that corresponds to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The resulting expression for the eigenvector will then be simplified to its most common form.\n\n5.  **Normalize and Present the Final Answer:** The eigenvector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components is equal to 1. `sympy`'s eigenvector function provides an unnormalized vector, so I will perform the normalization. Finally, I will print the components of the normalized eigenvector.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_eigenvector_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the normalized eigenvector of a spin operator in the x-z plane\n    for the eigenvalue +hbar/2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for hbar and the angle theta\n    hbar = sp.Symbol('hbar', real=True, positive=True)\n    theta = sp.Symbol('theta', real=True)\n\n    # Define the Pauli matrices which are the core of the P operators\n    sigma_x = sp.Matrix([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n    sigma_z = sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n    # Define the P operators\n    P_x = (hbar / 2) * sigma_x\n    P_z = (hbar / 2) * sigma_z\n\n    # The direction vector n lies in the x-z plane\n    # n = (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta))\n    # The operator P_n = P_x*sin(theta) + P_z*cos(theta)\n    P_n = P_x * sp.sin(theta) + P_z * sp.cos(theta)\n\n    # Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P_n\n    # The eigenvects() method returns tuples of (eigenvalue, multiplicity, [eigenvectors])\n    eigen_data = P_n.eigenvects()\n\n    # We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +hbar/2\n    target_eigenvalue = hbar / 2\n    eigenvector = None\n\n    for val, mult, vects in eigen_data:\n        if sp.simplify(val - target_eigenvalue) == 0:\n            # Found the correct eigenvalue, get its eigenvector\n            # The function returns a list of vectors, we take the first one\n            eigenvector = vects[0]\n            break\n\n    # The eigenvector returned by sympy is unnormalized.
