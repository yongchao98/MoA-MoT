    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Calculation:** First, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved. Based on the chemical reaction Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O, we can determine the moles of H⁺ ions required to react completely with the Fe(OH)₃.\n\n2.  **Excess Acid for pH:** Dissolving the solid requires the solution to be acidic. This means after the neutralization reaction is complete, there must still be some excess H⁺ ions in the solution to maintain a low pH. The total acid added must account for both the H⁺ that reacts and the H⁺ that remains to set the final pH.\n\n3.  **Mass Balance Equation:** We can set up a mass balance equation for the H⁺ ions:\n    *Total moles of H⁺ added* = *Moles of H⁺ reacted with Fe(OH)₃* + *Moles of H⁺ remaining in the final solution*.\n    Mathematically:\n    `V_acid * C_acid = (3 * mass_FeOH3 / M_FeOH3) + (10^(-pH) * V_total)`\n\n4.  **Verify Options:** Since we are given four possible answers (pairs of volume and pH), we will test each option to see which one satisfies the mass balance equation. The correct option will be the one where the moles of acid added (calculated from the given volume) are equal to the moles required (for both reaction and final pH).\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum volume of strong acid needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3\n    and the pH of the resulting solution by testing the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    mass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\n    total_volume_cm3 = 100.0  # cm3\n    total_volume_L = total_volume_cm3 / 1000.0  # L\n    acid_concentration = 0.1  # M\n\n    # Molar masses (g/mol)\n    M_Fe = 55.845\n    M_O = 15.999\n    M_H = 1.008\n\n    # Options provided in the problem\n    options = {\n        'A': {'pH': 4.94, 'vol_cm3': 20.40},\n        'B': {'pH': 2.04, 'vol_cm3': 28.05},\n        'C': {'pH': 2.69, 'vol_cm3': 30.09},\n        'D': {'pH': 3.16, 'vol_cm3': 32.14}\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate stoichiometric requirements ---\n    molar_mass_feoh3 = M_Fe + 3 * M_O + 3 * M_H\n    moles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\n    \n    # According to Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O, 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3\n    moles_h_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step verification of each option:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve: {moles_feoh3:.6f} mol\")\n    print(f\"Stoichiometric moles of H+ needed for reaction: {moles_h_reacted:.6f} mol\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Test each option against the mass balance equation ---\n    # Total H+ added = H+ reacted + H+ remaining\n    correct_option = None\n    for option_key, values in options.items():\n        pH = values['pH']\n        vol_cm3 = values['vol_cm3']\n        vol_L = vol_cm3 / 1000.0\n\n        # Calculate total moles of H+ added from the acid volume\n        moles_h_added = vol_L * acid_concentration\n\n        # Calculate moles of H+ remaining in the final solution to achieve the given pH\n        moles_h_final = (10**(-pH)) * total_volume_L\n        \n        # Calculate the total required moles of H+ based on the option's pH\n        total_moles_required = moles_h_reacted + moles_h_final\n\n        print(f\"Testing Option {option_key} (pH={pH}, Volume={vol_cm3} cm3):\")\n        print(f\"  - Moles H+ added from acid: {moles_h_added:.6f} mol\")\n        print(f\"  - Moles H+ required (reaction + final pH): {total_moles_required:.6f} mol\")\n\n        # Check if the moles added match the moles required\n        if math.isclose(moles_h_added, total_moles_required, rel_tol=1e-2):\n            correct_option = option_key\n            print(f\"  - Result: This option is consistent.\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"  - Result: This option is not consistent.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Final Answer ---\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is Option {correct_option}.\")\n    print(f\"The pH is {options[correct_option]['pH']} and the required volume is {options[correct_option]['vol_cm3']:.2f} cm3.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
