    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the problem is to determine the number and types of stereoisomers produced from two separate reactions and then figure out how these isomers will behave when analyzed by two different types of HPLC (achiral and chiral).\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. The \"(E)\" designation means it's a trans-alkene. It's symmetric, so it's an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        1.  mCPBA: This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        2.  Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺): This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition (the incoming nucleophile, water, attacks from the side opposite the protonated epoxide oxygen).\n    *   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There's a well-known rule for stereospecific reactions:\n        *   `trans-alkene` + `anti-addition` -> `meso product`\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. The \"(Z)\" designation means it's a cis-alkene. It's also symmetric and achiral.\n    *   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n    *   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the other part of the rule:\n        *   `cis-alkene` + `anti-addition` -> `racemic mixture` (a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call them **E1** and **E2**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Products:** The chemist mixes the results of both reactions. The final mixture contains:\n    *   **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n    *   **E1** and **E2** (the enantiomeric pair) from Reaction 2.\n    *   Total distinct molecules in the flask: 3.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Chromatography:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n        *   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on properties like polarity, size, etc. It *cannot* distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it *can* separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties.\n        *   **Application:**\n            *   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n            *   **M** is a diastereomer of both **E1** and **E2**. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, resulting in a distinct peak.\n        *   **Result:** Peak 1 (for **M**) + Peak 2 (for **E1** + **E2**) = **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:**\n        *   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment interacts differently with each enantiomer of a pair, allowing them to be separated. It will also separate diastereomers.\n        *   **Application:**\n            *   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers. The chiral column will resolve them into two separate peaks.\n            *   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1** and **E2**, and it will also have its own unique retention time, resulting in a third peak. (Note: Since **M** is achiral, it cannot be resolved further, it's just one peak).\n        *   **Result:** Peak 1 (for **M**) + Peak 2 (for **E1**) + Peak 3 (for **E2**) = **3 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion & Matching:**\n    *   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n    *   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n    *   This matches option D.\n\n7.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will not execute a chemical simulation but will use `print` statements to lay out the logical steps derived above, leading to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Helper function to print the thinking process\ndef explain_reasoning():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to solve the stereochemistry problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Thinking Process:\")\n    print(\"1.
