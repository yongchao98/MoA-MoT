    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to determine the molecular formula of an unknown compound from a list of choices, using its spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data - Piece by Piece:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells me the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two things attached to it. A benzene ring is C6H6. When it's di-substituted, two hydrogens are replaced, so the ring itself is a C6H4 fragment. The 1H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\", which is typical for a symmetrical di-substituted ring (like a para-substituted one), accounting for the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring.\n        *   Fragment 1: C6H4. (6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens).\n\n    *   **\"FTIR ... shows ... an ester group\"**: An ester functional group is R-COO-R'. This group contains one carbonyl carbon (C=O) and one ether-like oxygen.\n        *   Fragment 2: -COO- group. (1 Carbon, 2 Oxygens).\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. The splitting pattern is key.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) means that proton is being split by one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and by three other equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This is a classic pattern for a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` system. Specifically, the H attached to the carbon that's also attached to the CH3.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is a \"doublet\" (d), meaning it's only split by one other proton (the first vinyl proton).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This group has 2 vinyl protons and 3 methyl protons.\n        *   Fragment 3: -CH=CH-CH3. (3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens).\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We've already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. There must be a second one.\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. Where does the second CH3 group belong? It must be part of the ester. For an ester (R-COO-R'), if we had an ethyl group (e.g., -COOCH2CH3), we would see a -CH2- signal. Since there isn't one, the alkyl part of the ester must be a methyl group (-CH3). So, the ester is a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`).\n        *   Fragment 4: The second -CH3 group, which is part of the ester. (1 Carbon, 3 Hydrogens).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Pieces and Calculate the Formula:** Now, I'll sum up all the atoms from the identified fragments.\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 1 (from -COO-) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's CH3 group) = 11 Carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's CH3 group) = 12 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the -COO- ester group).\n    *   **Total Formula:** C11H12O2.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n    *   My calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n5.  **Final Verification (Sanity Check):** Does the structure `propenyl-C6H4-COOCH3` fit all the data?\n    *   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n    *   Ester: Yes (-COOCH3).\n    *   Aromatic H: Yes (4H, 2 signals if para).\n    *   Vinyl H: Yes (2H, a `d` and a `dq`).\n    *   CH3 groups: Yes, two of them (one from propenyl, one from methyl ester).\n    *   No CH2 groups: Yes, there are none.\n    *   Total Signals: 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6 signals. This matches the data.\n    The logic holds up perfectly. The answer is C. Now, I will format this logic into the requested Python code block.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the chemical formula of a compound based on spectroscopic data.\n# I will break down the data to identify the structural fragments and then sum their atoms to get the molecular formula.\n\nprint(\"Let's determine the molecular formula step-by-step by analyzing the spectroscopic data.\")\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the core structure from the description.\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 1: Analyze the Aromatic Ring ---\")\nring_carbons = 6\nring_hydrogens = 4\nprint(f\"The compound is a 'di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring'.\")\nprint(f\"This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogens have been replaced by other groups.\")\nprint(f\"This core structure is C6H4, contributing {ring_carbons} carbons and {ring_hydrogens} hydrogens.\")\nprint(\"The 'two signals corresponding to aromatic-H' in the 1H NMR spectrum is consistent with the 4 hydrogens on this C6H4 ring.\")\n\n# Step 2: Identify the functional groups from FTIR and NMR.\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 2: Identify the Functional Groups ---\")\n# Ester group\nester_oxygens = 2\nester_carbonyl_carbons = 1\nprint(f\"The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-).
