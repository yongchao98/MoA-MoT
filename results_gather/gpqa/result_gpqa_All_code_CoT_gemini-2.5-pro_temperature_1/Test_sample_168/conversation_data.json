    "This problem requires reasoning based on fundamental principles of particle physics, specifically the conservation of energy and the kinematics of multi-particle decays. I will write a Python script that explains this reasoning step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Spectrum Shape (Continuous vs. Discrete):** The shape of the energy spectrum depends on the number of particles in the final state of the decay. I'll compare the number of final-state particles in both the original and variant decays. A final state with more than two particles leads to a continuous energy spectrum for any single product, as the total released energy is shared in a variable manner among all products.\n2.  **Analyze the Spectrum Endpoint:** The endpoint (maximum energy) of the spectrum is determined by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value. The Q-value is the difference between the total rest mass energy of the initial particles and the total rest mass energy of the final particles. I will compare the Q-values of the two decays.\n3.  **Combine Results and Conclude:** Based on the analysis of the spectrum's shape and endpoint, I will select the correct option from the given choices.\n\n```python\n# This script analyzes a nuclear decay problem by applying principles of physics.\n\nprint(\"Analyzing the two decay processes to determine the change in the E particle energy spectrum.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# --- Step 1: Analyze the nature of the energy spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete) ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Analyzing the shape of the energy spectrum.\")\nprint(\"The original decay is 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V.
