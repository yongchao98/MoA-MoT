    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Conditions After Dilution:**\n    *   First, we determine the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution.\n    *   Then, we calculate the new total volume after adding water.\n    *   Using the moles and the new volume, we find the concentration of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated.\n\n2.  **Calculate pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   The titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH) creates a buffer solution before the equivalence point.\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: `pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])`, where `HA` is acetic acid and `A-` is its conjugate base, acetate.\n    *   First, we calculate the `pKa` from the given `Ka` (`pKa = -log10(Ka)`).\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate. This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n    *   The ratio `[A-]/[HA]` will be `25/75` or `1/3`.\n    *   We can then substitute these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n3.  **Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   First, we need to find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point, where the moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (`A-`). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this acetate ion in water: `A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-`.\n    *   We calculate the total volume of the solution at this point (initial diluted volume + volume of NaOH added).\n    *   We calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (`[A-]`).\n    *   We calculate `Kb` for acetate using the formula `Kb = Kw / Ka`, where `Kw` (the ion product of water) is `1.0 x 10^-14` at 25°C.\n    *   Using an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction and the `Kb` value, we can solve for the hydroxide ion concentration, `[OH-]`. The equilibrium expression is `Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]`.\n    *   From `[OH-]`, we calculate the `pOH` (`pOH = -log10([OH-])`).\n    *   Finally, we find the pH using the relationship `pH = 14 - pOH`.\n\n4.  **Final Output:**\n    *   The script will print the calculated pH values for both the 25% titration point and the equivalence point, which will correspond to one of the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Initial values and constants ---\nV_acid_initial = 20.00 / 1000  # Initial volume of acetic acid in L\nC_acid_initial = 0.05        # Initial concentration of acetic acid in M\nV_water = 20.00 / 1000         # Volume of water added for dilution in L\nC_base = 0.1                   # Concentration of NaOH titrant in M\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5              # Ka for acetic acid\nKw = 1.0e-14                   # Ion product of water at 25°C\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate conditions after dilution ---\n# Moles of acetic acid (HA)\nmoles_acid = V_acid_initial * C_acid_initial\n\n# Total volume after dilution\nV_total_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\n\n# Concentration of acetic acid after dilution\nC_acid_diluted = moles_acid / V_total_diluted\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% titration ---\n# At 25% titration, we are in the buffer region.\n# We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\nratio = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate pH at the equivalence point ---\n# At the equivalence point, moles of base added = initial moles of acid\n# C_base * V_eq = moles_acid\nV_eq = moles_acid / C_base\n\n# Total volume at the equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_total_diluted + V_eq\n\n# At the equivalence point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base (A-)\n# The concentration of the conjugate base [A-] is:\nmoles_A_minus = moles_acid\nC_A_minus = moles_A_minus / V_total_eq\n\n# The conjugate base hydrolyzes: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# We need Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka_acid\n\n# Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] = x^2 / (C_A_minus - x)\n# We can approximate that x is small, so Kb ≈ x^2 / C_A_minus\n# x = [OH-]\n# x^2 = Kb * C_A_minus\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * C_A_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Step 4: Final Output ---\nprint(\"Calculations:\")\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 4.26; 8.52\")\nprint(f\"B) 4.73; 7.00\")\nprint(f\"C) 4.57; 6.92\")\nprint(f\"D) 3.17; 6.73\")\n\n# The calculated values (4.26 and 8.52) match option A.\n<<<A>>>\n```"
