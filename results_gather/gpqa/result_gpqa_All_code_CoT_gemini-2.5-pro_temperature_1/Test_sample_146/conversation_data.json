    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Energy.** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n2.  **Define the Initial and Final States.**\n    *   **Initial State:** A proton and an antiproton, both considered to be at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies: $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   **Final State:** Four particles of type A ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$), all moving with the same speed $v$. The total final energy is the sum of their relativistic energies: $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$, where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n3.  **Set up the Energy Conservation Equation:** $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n4.  **Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$).** We can simplify the equation to $\\gamma = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$.\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v$).** Using the relation $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$, I will calculate the value of $\\beta$.\n6.  **Compare the Result.** I will compare the calculated velocity with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\nI will use the following values:\n*   Proton rest energy ($m_p c^2$): 938.27 MeV\n*   Particle A rest energy ($m_A c^2$): 300 MeV\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the known physical constants from the problem.\n# Rest energy of a proton (and antiproton) in MeV.\nmp_c2 = 938.27  # MeV\n# Rest energy of particle A in MeV.\nmA_c2 = 300.0   # MeV\n\n# Step 2: Apply the conservation of energy principle.\n# Initial Energy (E_i) = 2 * mp_c2 (rest energy of proton and antiproton)\n# Final Energy (E_f) = 4 * gamma * mA_c2 (total relativistic energy of four A particles)\n# E_i = E_f  =>  2 * mp_c2 = 4 * gamma * mA_c2\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the Lorentz factor (gamma).\n# gamma = (2 * mp_c2) / (4 * mA_c2) = mp_c2 / (2 * mA_c2)\ngamma = mp_c2 / (2 * mA_c2)\n\n# Step 4: Solve for the velocity (v) as a fraction of the speed of light (c).\n# The velocity v is related to gamma by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).\n# Let beta = v/c. Then beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\nbeta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))\nbeta = math.sqrt(beta_squared)\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and compare with the given options.\nprint(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A is v = {beta:.3f}c.\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.96c\")\nprint(\"B) 0.77c\")\nprint(\"C) 0.86c\")\nprint(\"D) 0.91c\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.769c is closest to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number or choice in the final print!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider this annihilation process\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nThe antiproton is slowly moving and $m_{A}c^{2}=300MeV$.\n\nWhat is the velocity of particle A?\n\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.91c\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>"
