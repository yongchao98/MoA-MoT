    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the supermassive black hole. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Given Values:** We'll start by defining the necessary physical constants (Gravitational constant `G`, speed of light `c`, Boltzmann constant `k_B`, reduced Planck constant `ħ`) and the given values from the problem (distance `d`, angular size `θ`). We also need conversion factors for parsecs to meters and degrees to radians.\n2.  **Unit Conversion:** The distance `d` is given in parsecs and the angular size `θ` is in degrees. We must convert them to standard SI units (meters and radians, respectively) for our calculations.\n3.  **Calculate the Black Hole's Radius:** Using the small angle approximation (`size ≈ distance × angle`), we can calculate the diameter of the event horizon. The radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (`r_s`), is half of this diameter.\n4.  **Calculate the Entropy:** We will use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. A convenient form of this formula is `S = (k_B * π * r_s^2 * c^3) / (ħ * G)`. We will plug in the calculated radius and the physical constants to find the entropy `S`.\n5.  **Determine the Order of Magnitude:** Finally, we will examine the calculated value of the entropy to determine its order of magnitude and match it with one of the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\n# Physical constants in SI units\nG = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nc = 299792458    # Speed of light (m/s)\nk_B = 1.380649e-23 # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34 # Reduced Planck constant (J·s)\n\n# Conversion factors\nparsec_to_m = 3.0857e16 # Meters per parsec\ndeg_to_rad = math.pi / 180 # Radians per degree\n\n# Given values from the problem\nd_parsecs = 10**10 # Distance in parsecs\ntheta_deg = 10**-17 # Angular size in degrees\n\n# Step 2: Convert units to SI\nd_m = d_parsecs * parsec_to_m       # Distance in meters\ntheta_rad = theta_deg * deg_to_rad  # Angular size in radians\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (r_s)\n# Using the small angle approximation, diameter = d * θ. Radius is diameter / 2.\nr_s = (d_m * theta_rad) / 2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S)\n# S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p^2), where A = 4 * π * r_s^2 and l_p^2 = (ħ * G) / c^3\n# This simplifies to S = (k_B * π * r_s^2 * c^3) / (ħ * G)\nentropy = (k_B * math.pi * (r_s**2) * (c**3)) / (h_bar * G)\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and determine the correct option\nprint(f\"The calculated entropy of the black hole is: {entropy:.2e} J/K\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 10^62 J/K\")\nprint(\"B) 10^59 J/K\")\nprint(\"C) 10^66 J/K\")\nprint(\"D) 10^65 J/K\")\n\n# The result is in the order of 10^62, which corresponds to option A.\nprint(\"\\nThe correct option is A.\")\n<<<A>>>\n```"
