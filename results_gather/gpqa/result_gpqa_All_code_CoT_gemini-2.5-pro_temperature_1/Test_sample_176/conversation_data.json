    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Laws:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`, where `L` is luminosity, `R` is the radius, `T` is the surface temperature, and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) is related to temperature by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_max = b / T`, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to Star_2 (L2).\n    `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)`\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`\n\n3.  **Determine the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so the ratio `R1/R2` is 1.5.\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (`λ_obs`) are the same for both stars.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity (`v`) due to the Doppler effect. The non-relativistic approximation is `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)`, where `λ_rest` is the wavelength in the star's own reference frame and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1, `v1 = 0`, so `λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1`.\n    *   For Star_2, `v2 = 700 km/s`, so `λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can say `λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   According to Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength (`T = b / λ_rest`). Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1`.\n    *   Substituting our finding, we get `T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / (λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c))`, which simplifies to `T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio equation and compute the final value. Note that the given mass information is not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants.\n# The ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2.\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s.\nv2 = 700.0\n\n# The speed of light in km/s.\nc = 299792.458\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2).\n# The observed peak wavelengths are the same. Due to the Doppler effect,\n# this means their rest-frame wavelengths are different.\n# lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)\n# Since T is proportional to 1/lambda_rest (Wien's Law), the temperature ratio is:\n# T1/T2 = lambda_rest_2 / lambda_rest_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\nv2_over_c = v2 / c\nT1_over_T2 = 1.0 / (1.0 + v2_over_c)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the luminosity ratio (L1/L2).\n# The luminosity ratio is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and compare with the given options.\nprint(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Radius ratio (R1/R2): {R1_over_R2}\")\nprint(f\"Temperature ratio (T1/T2): {T1_over_T2:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"Luminosity ratio (L1/L2) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = ({R1_over_R2})^2 * ({T1_over_T2:.6f})^4\")\nprint(f\"Calculated luminosity ratio L1/L2: {luminosity_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~2.35\")\nprint(\"B) ~2.23\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.25\")\nprint(\"D) ~2.32\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {luminosity_ratio:.2f} is closest to option B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
