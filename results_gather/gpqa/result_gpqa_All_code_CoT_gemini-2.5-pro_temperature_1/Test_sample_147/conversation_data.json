    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can set up an equation to find the atomic weight of Y (Ar(Y)) in terms of n (the number of fluorine atoms).\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    where Ar(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    By rearranging the formula, we get:\n    Ar(Y) = n * (19.00 * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196) ≈ n * 40.45\n\n2.  **Test Plausible Candidates for Y:** We will test small integer values for `n` to find an element Y whose atomic weight matches the calculated Ar(Y).\n    *   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (close to Ca, but CaF₂ has ɷF=48.7%)\n    *   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (close to Br, but bromine fluorides don't match ɷF)\n    *   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35. This is very close to Antimony (Sb), which has Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol. Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3 * 19) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   Other candidates (like Pu for n=6) fit the mass percentage but are eliminated by other clues. For instance, the problem states A4 is part of a \"colorless concentrated solution\". Plutonium fluorides are all colored, which rules out Pu as element Y.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify Y as Antimony (Sb) and A2 as SbF₃.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4:** The problem states that A4 is a binary compound of Y (Sb) and fluorine, and it forms a colorless solution. The common binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ (white/colorless solid) and SbF₅ (colorless solid/liquid). So, A4 must be one of these two.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights and Compare with Options:** We will calculate the molecular weights of our two candidates for A4 and see which one fits the given ranges.\n    *   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₃**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = Ar(Sb) + 3 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₅**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = Ar(Sb) + 5 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match with Given Ranges:**\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 160-180\n    *   D) 220-240\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range C (160-180). The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the ranges (it is close to, but outside of, range D).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the evidence, A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight falls in the range of 160-180. The other pieces of information in the problem (regarding substance A1 and the 1:1 reaction) seem to contain contradictions or refer to highly unusual chemistry, but the identification of A4 is robust based on the mass percentage and molecular weight options.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify element Y and substance A2\n# Let Ar_Y be the atomic weight of element Y, and Ar_F be the atomic weight of Fluorine.\n# Let n be the number of fluorine atoms in A2.\n# The mass percentage of Fluorine in A2 is 31.96% or 0.3196.\n# 0.3196 = (n * Ar_F) / (Ar_Y + n * Ar_F)\nAr_F = 19.00\nw_F = 0.3196\n\n# Rearranging the formula to solve for Ar_Y:\n# Ar_Y = n * Ar_F * (1 - w_F) / w_F\n# Let's calculate the factor for n\nfactor = Ar_F * (1 - w_F) / w_F\n\n# Let's test integer values for n\n# n = 1: Ar_Y = 1 * factor\n# n = 2: Ar_Y = 2 * factor\n# n = 3: Ar_Y = 3 * factor\nn = 3\nAr_Y_calculated = n * factor\n# This calculated atomic weight is very close to Antimony (Sb), Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol.\n# So we conclude Y = Sb and A2 = SbF3.\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Identify A4 and calculate molecular weights.\n# A4 is a colorless binary fluoride of Antimony.\n# The possibilities are SbF3 and SbF5.\nAr_Sb = 121.76\n\n# Calculate MW of SbF3\nmw_sbf3 = Ar_Sb + 3 * Ar_F\n\n# Calculate MW of SbF5\nmw_sbf5 = Ar_Sb + 5 * Ar_F\n\n# Step 5 & 6: Compare with options and conclude.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": (110, 130),\n    \"B\": (140, 160),\n    \"C\": (160, 180),\n    \"D\": (220, 240)\n}\n\nprint(f\"Based on mass percentage, element Y is likely Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated atomic weight for Y (with n=3) is {Ar_Y_calculated:.2f} g/mol, which is close to Ar(Sb) = {Ar_Sb} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nA4 is a colorless fluoride of Sb, so it could be SbF3 or SbF5.\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of SbF3 is {mw_sbf3:.2f} g/mol.\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of SbF5 is {mw_sbf5:.2f} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing these with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 110-130\")\nprint(f\"B) 140-160\")\nprint(f\"C) 160-180\")\nprint(f\"D) 220-240\")\n\n# Check which range fits\nfinal_choice = \"\"\nif options[\"A\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"A\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"A\"\nelif options[\"B\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"B\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"B\"\nelif options[\"C\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"C\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"C\"\nelif options[\"D\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"D\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"D\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe molecular weight of SbF3 ({mw_sbf3:.2f}) falls into range C.\")\n\nif options[\"A\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"A\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"B\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"B\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"C\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"C\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"D\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"D\"][1]:\n    pass\nelse:\n    print(f\"The molecular weight of SbF5 ({mw_sbf5:.2f}) does not fall neatly into any range.\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, A4 is most likely SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180.\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is {final_choice}.\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```"
