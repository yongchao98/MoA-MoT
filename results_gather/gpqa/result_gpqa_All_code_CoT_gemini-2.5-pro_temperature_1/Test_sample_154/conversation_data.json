    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$ for the given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$. The uncertainty is defined by the formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\nwhere $\\langle O \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|O|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of an operator $O$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Define the operator and state**: We will represent the operator $P_z$ and the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ as a matrix and a column vector, respectively, using the `numpy` library. We'll set the constant $\\hbar$ to 1 for the numerical calculation and reintroduce it in the final result.\n    -   $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    -   $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n2.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**: This is computed as the matrix product $\\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$, where $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**: First, we find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$ by squaring the matrix $P_z$. Then, we compute the expectation value $\\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n4.  **Calculate the uncertainty**: We substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula.\n5.  **Compare and select the answer**: We compare our calculated result with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct one.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_uncertainty():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the uncertainty of the P_z operator for a given quantum state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For numerical calculations, we can set hbar = 1 and add it back at the end.\n    hbar = 1.0\n\n    # The matrix form of the operator P_z.\n    P_z = hbar * np.array([\n        [1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, -1]\n    ], dtype=float)\n\n    # The state of the system is given by the column vector |psi>.\n    psi = np.array([\n        [-1/2],\n        [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n        [-1/2]\n    ], dtype=float)\n\n    # The bra vector <psi| is the conjugate transpose of the ket |psi>.\n    psi_bra = psi.conj().T\n\n    # Calculate the expectation value of P_z, <P_z> = <psi|P_z|psi>.\n    # The @ operator is used for matrix multiplication.\n    exp_Pz = (psi_bra @ P_z @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n    # Calculate the operator P_z^2.\n    P_z_sq = P_z @ P_z\n\n    # Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2, <P_z^2> = <psi|P_z^2|psi>.\n    exp_Pz_sq = (psi_bra @ P_z_sq @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n    # The variance is Var(P_z) = <P_z^2> - <P_z>^2.\n    variance_Pz = exp_Pz_sq - exp_Pz**2\n\n    # The uncertainty (standard deviation) is the square root of the variance.\n    delta_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n    # The options given are:\n    # A) sqrt(2)*hbar\n    # B) hbar/sqrt(2)\n    # C) hbar/2\n    # D) hbar\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": np.sqrt(2) * hbar,\n        \"B\": hbar / np.sqrt(2),\n        \"C\": hbar / 2,\n        \"D\": hbar\n    }\n\n    # Find which option matches the calculated uncertainty.\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        if np.isclose(delta_Pz, value):\n            final_choice = choice\n            break\n    \n    print(f\"The calculated uncertainty is Delta P_z = {delta_Pz:.4f} * hbar\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to hbar/sqrt(2).\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is {final_choice}.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n\nsolve_uncertainty()\n```"
