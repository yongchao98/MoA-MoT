    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first reaction is:\n`butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n\nThis reaction is a nucleophilic addition to a ketone, specifically a cyanohydrin formation.\n1.  **Reactants**: We start with butan-2-one (a ketone) and sodium cyanide (NaCN), which provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻) as a nucleophile.\n2.  **Mechanism**: The nucleophilic CN⁻ attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n3.  **Role of Reagent A**: The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product. Therefore, reagent A must be a source of protons, i.e., an acid. H₃O⁺ is a common and effective proton source for this step. NaHSO₃ is incorrect as it would lead to a different type of addition product (a bisulfite adduct).\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: Reagent A is H₃O⁺. This narrows down our choices to options A and B.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nThe second reaction is:\n`2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n\nThis reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n1.  **Transformation**: This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n2.  **Conditions**: Nitrile hydrolysis is typically carried out under strong acidic or basic conditions with heat. The reaction requires a catalyst to proceed effectively.\n3.  **Role of Reagent B**: Reagent B, along with water, must facilitate this hydrolysis.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze this reaction to completion.\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: Reagent B should be a strong acid like HCl.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results and select the correct option.**\n*   From Step 1, we determined that A = H₃O⁺.\n*   From Step 2, we determined that B = HCl.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\nA) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\nB) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\nC) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\nD) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n\nThe only option that fits both conclusions is B.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the correct reagents A and B for two chemical reactions.\n\n# Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A -> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n# This is a cyanohydrin formation. The cyanide ion (CN-) from NaCN attacks the ketone.\n# An alkoxide intermediate is formed, which needs to be protonated.\n# Reagent A must be a proton source (an acid).\n# H3O+ is a suitable proton source. NaHSO3 is not the standard reagent for this step.\n# So, A = H3O+. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n# Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) -> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n# This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile (-CN) group to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n# This hydrolysis is typically catalyzed by a strong acid or a strong base.\n# Reagent B must be the catalyst.\n# Between HCl (a strong acid) and CH3COOH (a weak acid), HCl is the more effective and standard catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n# So, B = HCl.\n\n# Combining the conclusions:\n# A = H3O+\n# B = HCl\n\n# Let's check the options:\n# A) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH (Incorrect, B is a weak acid)\n# B) A = H3O+, B = HCl (Correct)\n# C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl (Incorrect, A is wrong)\n# D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH (Incorrect, both A and B are wrong)\n\ncorrect_option = 'B'\nprint(f\"The correct option is {correct_option}.\")\nprint(\"Explanation:\")\nprint(\"In the first reaction, a cyanohydrin is formed. This requires a nucleophilic attack by CN- followed by protonation. H3O+ (A) is the acid source for this protonation.\")\nprint(\"In the second reaction, a nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. This reaction is catalyzed by a strong acid like HCl (B) in the presence of water.\")\n\nfinal_answer = 'B'\nprint(f'<<<B>>>')\n```"
