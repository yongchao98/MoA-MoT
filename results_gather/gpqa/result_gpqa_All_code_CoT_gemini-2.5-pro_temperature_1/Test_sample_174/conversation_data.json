    "This problem requires us to determine the angular and wavelength dependence of radiation from an oscillating charge distribution. We can model this system as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence:** The power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole with its axis along the z-axis is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle with the z-axis.\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    The maximum power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value of 1 (at `θ = 90°`). Therefore, `A = C * 1`, which means the constant `C` is equal to `A`.\n    So, the formula is `dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`.\n    We will calculate the value of this expression for `θ = 30°` to find the fraction of `A`.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence:** According to the Larmor formula, the total power radiated by an accelerating charge (and thus by an oscillating dipole) is proportional to the square of the acceleration. For sinusoidal oscillation, this leads to the power being proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴`.\n    `P ∝ ω⁴`\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `f` is the frequency.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n    `P ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n    Thus, the radiated power has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** We will combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the correct option among the choices. The code will perform the calculation for Step 1 and identify the correct option based on both criteria.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the angular dependence fraction\n# The radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# dP/dΩ = A * sin^2(theta), where A is the maximum power (at theta = 90 degrees).\n# We need to find the fraction of A at theta = 30 degrees.\n\ntheta_degrees = 30\n# Convert degrees to radians for Python's math functions\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# Calculate sin^2(theta)\nfraction = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\nprint(f\"The angle is {theta_degrees} degrees.\")\nprint(f\"The radiated power is proportional to sin^2({theta_degrees}°), which is {fraction:.2f}.\")\nprint(f\"So the fraction of maximum power A is {fraction:.2f}, or 1/4.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Determine the wavelength dependence\n# Radiated power is proportional to ω^4, where ω is the angular frequency.\n# Since ω = 2πc/λ, power is proportional to (1/λ)^4 or λ^(-4).\n# So the exponent for λ is -4.\nlambda_exponent = -4\nprint(\"The radiated power is proportional to λ^(-4).\")\nprint(f\"The exponent of λ is {lambda_exponent}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3: Match the results with the given options\noptions = {\n    'A': (1/4, -4),\n    'B': (3/4, -6),\n    'C': (1/2, -4),\n    'D': (1/4, -3)\n}\n\n# The calculated fraction is 1/4, and the exponent is -4.\ncalculated_result = (fraction, lambda_exponent)\n\n# Find the matching option\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option, values in options.items():\n    # Use math.isclose for floating point comparison\n    if math.isclose(values[0], calculated_result[0]) and values[1] == calculated_result[1]:\n        correct_option = option\n        break\n\nprint(\"Comparing our results with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) Fraction=1/4, Wavelength dependence=λ^(-4)\")\nprint(f\"B) Fraction=3/4, Wavelength dependence=λ^(-6)\")\nprint(f\"C) Fraction=1/2, Wavelength dependence=λ^(-4)\")\nprint(f\"D) Fraction=1/4, Wavelength dependence=λ^(-3)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Our calculated fraction is {fraction:.2f} and λ exponent is {lambda_exponent}.\")\nprint(f\"This matches option {correct_option}.\")\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(\"<<<A>>>\")\n```"
