    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Constraint:** The main limitation for observing astronomical objects from the ground is the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs most light in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n2.  **Determine the Observational Wavelength:** For an object to be detected by a ground-based optical telescope, its light must have a wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere. The \"optical window\" begins at the edge of the UV spectrum, at a wavelength of approximately 3500 Angstroms (Å). Therefore, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) of the Lyman-alpha line must be greater than this cutoff.\n3.  **Use the Redshift Formula:** The redshift `z` relates the wavelength of light at its source (rest wavelength, λ_rest) to the wavelength we observe (λ_obs) with the formula:\n    `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n4.  **Set up and Solve the Equation:** We are given the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line, `λ_rest ≈ 1216 Å`. We need to find the minimum redshift `z` that will shift this line to our minimum observable wavelength, `λ_obs ≈ 3500 Å`. We can rearrange the formula to solve for `z`:\n    `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`\n5.  **Calculate and Compare:** By plugging in the values, we can calculate the minimum redshift and compare it to the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_redshift_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha\n    absorption with ground-based optical telescopes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
