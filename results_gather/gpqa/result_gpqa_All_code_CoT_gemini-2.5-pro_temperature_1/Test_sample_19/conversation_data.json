    "My plan is to solve this physics question by carefully analyzing the definition of the \"impulse approximation\" and evaluating how each of the four given statements contributes to it.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concept:** The impulse approximation is a simplifying assumption used in nuclear and particle physics. Its central idea is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleon inside a nucleus happens so quickly that the nucleon can be treated as if it were a free particle, isolated from the other nucleons and the forces that bind it.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Statement:**\n    *   **Statement 1:** \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\" This is essential. The approximation breaks down if the interaction involves multiple nucleons simultaneously (e.g., via meson-exchange currents). The model must be based on a \"one-body\" interaction.\n    *   **Statement 2:** \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\" This is also a standard part of the approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). It assumes the incoming and outgoing particles do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons. This is necessary to treat the interaction as a clean event with a single, isolated nucleon.\n    *   **Statement 3:** \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\" This statement describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While this might be another approximation used in a calculation, it is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation concerns the nucleon's state and behavior *within the nucleus*, not its internal composition.\n    *   **Statement 4:** \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\" This is the very essence of the \"impulse.\" The interaction (e.g., absorbing a high-energy photon) is assumed to occur over a timescale much shorter than the timescale of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus. For that brief moment, the binding potential is negligible, and the nucleon acts as if it's free.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The impulse approximation is jointly defined by the assumptions that the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), this nucleon is not affected by the surrounding nuclear medium during the event (2), and the binding forces are negligible during the rapid interaction (4). Therefore, the correct assumptions are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\nI will now write a Python code snippet to represent this logic and print the final choice.\n\n```python\n# The goal is to identify the set of assumptions that define the impulse approximation.\n\n# Step 1: Define the core requirements for the impulse approximation based on its physical meaning.\n# - The interaction must be with a single nucleon.\n# - The influence of other nucleons (spectators) must be negligible.\n# - The binding forces must be negligible during the brief interaction.\nrequired_assumptions = {1, 2, 4}\n\n# Step 2: Define the choices provided in the question.\nchoices = {\n    \"A\": {1, 2, 4},\n    \"B\": {1, 2, 3},\n    \"C\": {2, 3, 4},\n    \"D\": {1, 3, 4}\n}\n\n# Step 3: Find the choice that matches the required set of assumptions.\ncorrect_choice = None\nfor option, assumption_set in choices.items():\n    if assumption_set == required_assumptions:\n        correct_choice = option\n        break\n\n# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer.\nprint(\"Analysis of the Impulse Approximation Assumptions:\")\nprint(\"1. 'Interaction with individual nucleons' is REQUIRED. This is the basis of the one-body current approach.\")\nprint(\"2. 'Nucleus is transparent' is REQUIRED. This neglects initial/final state interactions.\")\nprint(\"3. 'Quarks are non-relativistic' is NOT REQUIRED. This is an assumption about internal nucleon structure, not the impulse approximation itself.\")\nprint(\"4. 'No binding forces' is REQUIRED. This is the core 'impulse' concept - the interaction is too fast for the potential to act.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct set of assumptions is {1, 2, 4}.\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option: {correct_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
