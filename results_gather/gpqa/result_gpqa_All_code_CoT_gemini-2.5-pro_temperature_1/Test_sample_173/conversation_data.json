    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** Set up the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (M*c^2) in GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Masses:** Use the given relationships (m1 = 2*m2 and m1+m2 = 0.99*M) to determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (m1*c^2 and m2*c^2).\n3.  **Calculate Q-value:** The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):** Based on the conservation of momentum (p1 = p2) in classical mechanics (K = p^2 / 2m), the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass (K1/K2 = m2/m1). Use this ratio to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_classical) from the total kinetic energy (Q).\n5.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1):** Based on the conservation of momentum in relativistic mechanics (E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2), we can establish a relationship between the kinetic energies and rest-mass energies of the fragments. Solve for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1).\n6.  **Calculate the Difference:** Find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy (T1) and the classical kinetic energy (T1_classical).\n7.  **Select the Answer:** Convert the difference to MeV and compare it with the given options to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial values\n# E0_M is the rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus in GeV.\nE0_M = 300.0  # GeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\n# The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n# m1c2 + m2c2 = 0.99 * M*c^2\nm1c2_plus_m2c2 = 0.99 * E0_M\n\n# One fragment (m1) is 2 times more massive than the other (m2).\n# m1 = 2 * m2  => m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2\n# We have a system of two equations:\n# 1) m1c2 + m2c2 = m1c2_plus_m2c2\n# 2) m1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n# Substitute (2) into (1):\n# 2 * m2c2 + m2c2 = m1c2_plus_m2c2\n# 3 * m2c2 = m1c2_plus_m2c2\nm2c2 = m1c2_plus_m2c2 / 3.0\nm1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2\n\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1*c^2): {m1c2:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2*c^2): {m2c2:.2f} GeV\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\n# Q = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy\nQ = E0_M - m1c2_plus_m2c2\nprint(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q-value): {Q:.2f} GeV\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_classical)\n# In classical mechanics, from conservation of momentum (p1=p2), K = p^2/(2m).\n# This means K1/K2 = m2/m1.\n# Since K1 + K2 = Q, we have K1 + (m1/m2)*K1 = Q => K1 * (1 + m1/m2) = Q\n# T1_classical = Q / (1 + m1/m2) = Q / (1 + (2*m2)/m2) = Q / 3\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\nprint(f\"Classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_classical): {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1)\n# From conservation of momentum |p1|=|p2|, and E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, we get:\n# (pc)^2 = (K1 + m1c^2)^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = (K2 + m2c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2\n# K1^2 + 2*K1*m1c^2 = K2^2 + 2*K2*m2c^2\n# Substitute K2 = Q - K1 and solve for K1 (which is T1).\n# The solution is T1 = Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2) / (2 * (m1c^2 + m2c^2 + Q))\nT1 = Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2) / (2 * (m1c2_plus_m2c2 + Q))\nprint(f\"Relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1): {T1:.4f} GeV\")\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the difference\ndifference_GeV = T1 - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000 # Convert GeV to MeV\n\nprint(f\"\\nDifference (T1 - T1_classical): {difference_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference in MeV: {difference_MeV:.2f} MeV\")\n\n# Step 7: Select the answer\noptions = {'A': 10, 'B': 5, 'C': 20, 'D': 2}\nfinal_choice = ''\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if math.isclose(difference_MeV, value, rel_tol=1e-2):\n        final_choice = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated difference is approximately {round(difference_MeV)} MeV, which corresponds to option {final_choice}.\")\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(f'<<<{final_choice}>>>')\n```"
