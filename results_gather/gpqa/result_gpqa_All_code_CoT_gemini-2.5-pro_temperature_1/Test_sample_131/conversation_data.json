    "Here is a thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Identify two compounds from a list of four that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for all candidate compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio. This means the total number of protons contributed by each compound to the spectrum is equal.\n    *   **NMR Data (Aromatic Region):** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **NMR Data (Aliphatic Region):** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Candidate Compound's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The key is to determine the number of unique proton environments (which gives the number of signals) and the number of protons in each environment (which gives the integration). Symmetry is crucial here.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. Two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 2 protons (2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 12 protons (12H).\n        *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** No plane of symmetry that makes protons or methyl groups equivalent in the way needed.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) is different from the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, C1). So, **two aromatic singlets**, each for 1 proton (1H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. So, **four aliphatic singlets**, each for 3 protons (3H).\n        *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n    *   **Candidate 3: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 2 protons (2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This gives **two aliphatic singlets**, each for 6 protons (6H).\n        *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n    *   **Candidate 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n        *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups show spin-spin splitting. The CH2 protons will be a quartet and the CH3 protons will be a triplet.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not a possible component**. This immediately eliminates option C.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixture Options based on the combined spectra:**\n\n    *   **Observed Aromatic Spectrum:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute one singlet, and the number of protons for each singlet must be equal.\n    *   **Observed Aliphatic Spectrum:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals correspond to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, this is **two singlets**. Since both are 2H, the ratio is 1:1. **This matches.**\n        *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this is **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. **This matches.**\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n    *   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. The total is three aromatic singlets. **This does not match.**\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. The total is three aromatic singlets. **This does not match.**\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   Only option A correctly predicts the number and ratio of signals in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for mixtures of aromatic compounds to find the correct pair.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the predicted 1H NMR spectra for each candidate compound.\n    # The value is a dictionary containing lists of proton counts for each signal type.\n    # e.g., \"aromatic\": [2] means one aromatic singlet integrating to 2 protons.\n    # \"aliphatic\": [6, 6] means two aliphatic singlets, each integrating to 6 protons.\n    # \"notes\" are used to disqualify candidates based on splitting patterns.\n    compounds_data = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [2],\n            \"aliphatic\": [12],\n            \"notes\": \"All singlets\"\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [1, 1],\n            \"aliphatic\": [3, 3, 3, 3],\n            \"notes\": \"All singlets\"\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [2],\n            \"aliphatic\": [6, 6],\n            \"notes\": \"All singlets\"\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [4],\n            \"aliphatic\": [4, 6], # Proton counts for quartet and triplet\n            \"notes\": \"Contains non-singlet signals (quartet, triplet)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the options provided in the problem.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"B\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"C\": [\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"],\n        \"D\": [\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"]\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Define the observed spectral data from the problem description.\n    observed_aromatic_signals = 2\n    observed_aromatic_ratio = [1, 1] # Two signals of equal intensity\n    observed_aliphatic_signals = 3\n    observed_aliphatic_ratio = [2, 1, 1]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the problem based on predicted 1H NMR spectra...\\n\")\n\n    correct_option = None\n    # Step 4: Iterate through each option and test if it matches the observed data.\n    for option, pair in options.items():\n        print(f\"--- Checking Option {option}: {pair[0]} and {pair[1]} ---\")\n        \n        comp1_name, comp2_name = pair\n        comp1 = compounds_data[comp1_name]\n        comp2 = compounds_data[comp2_name]\n        \n        # Check for non-singlet disqualification\n        if \"non-singlet\" in comp1[\"notes\"] or \"non-singlet\" in comp2[\"notes\"]:\n            print(\"Result: Mismatch.
