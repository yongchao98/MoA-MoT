    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States**: The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) quantum numbers. The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" caused by an absorbed photon. In the context of roto-vibrational spectroscopy and considering the selection rules (Δv = +1, ΔJ = ±1 for absorption), the lowest energy transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) involves moving to the next vibrational level (v=1). The lowest energy rotational change allowed is from J=0 to J=1. Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**: The energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by E(v,J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + [ħ²/(2I)]*J(J+1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ω is the vibrational angular frequency, and I is the moment of inertia.\n    *   Initial energy: E_initial = E(0,0) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   Final energy: E_final = E(1,1) = (3/2)ħω + [ħ²/(2I)]*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n    *   The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference: ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + ħ²/I.\n\n3.  **Calculate Necessary Parameters**:\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ)**: For a diatomic molecule with masses Mx and My, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). We will convert the masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms.\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I)**: For a diatomic molecule, I = μR², where R is the bond length. We will convert the bond length from angstroms to meters.\n\n4.  **Calculate Photon Momentum (p)**: The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation ΔE = pc, where c is the speed of light. Therefore, the momentum is p = ΔE/c.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: We will implement these calculations in Python, using standard values for physical constants, to find the numerical value of the momentum and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\nh_bar = 1.0545718e-34\n# Speed of light (m/s)\nc = 2.99792458e8\n# Atomic mass unit to kg conversion\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27\n# Angstrom to meter conversion\nangstrom_to_m = 1.0e-10\n\n# --- Given Parameters ---\n# Mass of atom X (amu)\nMx_amu = 20\n# Mass of atom Y (amu)\nMy_amu = 2\n# Molecular bond length (angstroms)\nR_angstrom = 2\n# Angular frequency of vibration (rad/s)\nw = 4.0e14\n\n# --- Step 1: Convert units to SI ---\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate Reduced Mass (mu) ---\nmu_kg = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I) ---\nI = mu_kg * (R_m ** 2)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate Transition Energy (Delta_E) ---\n# The transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n# Delta_E = E_final - E_initial\n# Delta_E = ( (3/2)*h_bar*w + (h_bar**2 / I) ) - ( (1/2)*h_bar*w )\n# Delta_E = h_bar*w + (h_bar**2 / I)\n\n# Vibrational energy part of the transition\nE_vib_change = h_bar * w\n# Rotational energy part of the transition\nE_rot_change = (h_bar ** 2) / I\n# Total energy of the absorbed photon\nDelta_E = E_vib_change + E_rot_change\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate Photon Momentum (p) ---\np = Delta_E / c\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(f\"The calculated momentum of the photon is: {p:.2e} N*s\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) p = 1.9e-28 N*s\")\nprint(f\"B) p = 2.3e-27 N*s\")\nprint(f\"C) p = 1.1e-27 N*s\")\nprint(f\"D) p = 1.4e-28 N*s\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\noptions = {'A': 1.9e-28, 'B': 2.3e-27, 'C': 1.1e-27, 'D': 1.4e-28}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - p))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {p:.2e} N*s is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\nprint(f\"<<<{closest_option}>>>\")\n```"
