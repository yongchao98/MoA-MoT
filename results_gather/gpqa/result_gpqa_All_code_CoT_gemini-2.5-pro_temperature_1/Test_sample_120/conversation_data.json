    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Reaction Analysis**\n*   **Reactants:** The reaction is between a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and an organocuprate (Gilman reagent), Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The Gilman reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (CH3-).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity: Where does the nucleophile attack?**\n*   Organocuprates are \"soft\" nucleophiles and react with epoxides via an SN2-like mechanism. A key rule for this reaction is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The substrate `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   Let's examine the substitution at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** has a methyl group attached, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is a secondary carbon center.\n*   Comparing the tertiary C1 and the secondary C6, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity: What is the stereochemical outcome?**\n*   The SN2 reaction mechanism involves a backside attack, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The configurations of chiral centers not directly involved in the reaction are retained.\n*   Let's track the stereochemistry of each chiral center:\n    *   **Attack Site (C6):** The initial configuration at C6 is (S). Since the nucleophile attacks this carbon, its configuration will be inverted to **(R)**.\n    *   **Other Chiral Centers (C1, C3, C4):** These centers are not attacked. No bonds to these chiral atoms are broken or formed. Therefore, their configurations are retained.\n        *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C3 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming**\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring by adding a new methyl group to C6 and, after an aqueous workup, forming a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we prioritize the hydroxyl group. The carbon it's attached to (the original C1) becomes the new C1.\n*   We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (New C1 ← Old C1; New C2 ← Old C6; New C4 ← Old C4; New C5 ← Old C3). This gives the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Combining this with the stereochemistry determined in step 3:\n    *   New C1 (from old C1) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C2 (from old C6) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C4 (from old C4) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C5 (from old C3) is **(R)**.\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5.
