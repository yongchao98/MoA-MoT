    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\nThe problem relates the temperature of a star to the excitation of atoms within its photosphere. This relationship is described by the Boltzmann equation, which is valid under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (N_j and N_i):\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j / N_i` is the ratio of populations, which the problem refers to as \"excitation\".\n*   `g_j / g_i` is the ratio of statistical weights of the two levels (a constant for a given transition).\n*   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels (ΔE).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Set Up Equations for Both Stars**\nLet R(T) be the excitation at a given temperature T.\nFor star_1 (temperature T_1):\n`R_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]` (where C = g_j / g_i)\n\nFor star_2 (temperature T_2):\n`R_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n**3. Use the Given Relationship**\nThe problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2:\n`R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 2:\n`C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n**4. Simplify the Equation**\nFirst, cancel the constant `C` from both sides:\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nNow, isolate the '2' and rearrange the exponential terms:\n`2 = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nUsing the rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n`2 = exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n`2 = exp[(ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1))]`\n\n**5. Take the Natural Logarithm and Substitute Values**\nTake the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to remove the exponential:\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nThe problem gives `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`, and the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k ≈ 1`. Substituting this in:\n`ln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n**6. Final Algebraic Step**\nCombine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n`1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nSo, the final relationship is:\n`ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n```python\n# The problem is a derivation based on the Boltzmann equation.\n# The following steps outline the derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n# Step 1: Define the Boltzmann equation for the excitation ratio R at temperature T.\n# R(T) = C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T)), where C is a constant.\n\n# Step 2: Write the equations for star_1 and star_2.\n# R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_1))\n# R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_2))\n\n# Step 3: Use the given condition that R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n# C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_2))\n\n# Step 4: Simplify by canceling C and taking the natural log of both sides.\n# exp(-ΔE / (k*T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_2))\n# Taking the natural log (ln):\n# -ΔE / (k*T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k*T_2)\n\n# Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2).\n# ΔE / (k*T_2) - ΔE / (k*T_1) = ln(2)\n# (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n# Step 6: Use the given values: ΔE ≈ 1.38e-23 J and k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.\n# This makes the term (ΔE/k) approximately equal to 1.\n# 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n# Step 7: Combine the fractions.\n# (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) = ln(2)\n\n# This result matches option C.\ncorrect_option = 'C'\n\nprint(f\"The derivation shows that the relationship between the temperatures is:\")\nprint(f\"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2) ]\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {correct_option}.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
