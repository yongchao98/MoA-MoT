    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic physics problem involving time dilation from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nHere is my plan to solve it:\n1.  First, I need a crucial piece of information not given in the problem: the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud. I will use a commonly accepted approximate value for this distance, which is about 160,000 light-years. This round number works well with the provided options.\n2.  Next, I'll calculate how long the journey would take from the perspective of an observer on Earth. This is a simple `time = distance / speed` calculation.\n3.  Then, I'll use the time dilation formula to calculate the time that passes for the astronaut on the spacecraft (this is called \"proper time\"). The formula is: `t_astronaut = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`, where `v` is the spacecraft's speed and `c` is the speed of light.\n4.  Finally, I will compare the calculated time for the astronaut with the provided options to find the correct answer. I will also check if the astronaut, who is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 years, would survive the trip.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the constants ---\n# Speed of the spacecraft as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\nspeed_ratio = 0.99999987\n\n# Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud in light-years.\n# We'll use a standard approximation of 160,000 light-years.\ndistance_ly = 160000\n\n# Alien astronaut's details\nastronaut_age = 22\nlifespan = 150\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate travel time from Earth's perspective ---\n# time = distance / speed. Since distance is in light-years and speed is a fraction of c,\n# the time will be in years.\ntime_earth = distance_ly / speed_ratio\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate travel time from the astronaut's perspective (Time Dilation) ---\n# The formula is t_astronaut = t_earth * sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# where v/c is the speed_ratio.\nlorentz_factor_inv = math.sqrt(1 - speed_ratio**2)\ntime_astronaut = time_earth * lorentz_factor_inv\n\n# --- Step 4: Check if the astronaut survives and print the results ---\nremaining_lifespan = lifespan - astronaut_age\nsurvives = time_astronaut < remaining_lifespan\n\nprint(f\"Distance to Large Magellanic Cloud: {distance_ly} light-years\")\nprint(f\"Spacecraft speed: {speed_ratio * 100}% of the speed of light\")\nprint(f\"Time for the journey as measured from Earth: {time_earth:.2f} years\")\nprint(f\"Time for the journey as experienced by the astronaut: {time_astronaut:.2f} years\")\nprint(f\"The astronaut's remaining lifespan is {remaining_lifespan} years.\")\nprint(f\"Does the astronaut survive the journey? {'Yes' if survives else 'No'}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth. (This is {'incorrect' if survives else 'correct'})\")\nprint(f\"B) 77 years\")\nprint(f\"C) 81 years\")\nprint(f\"D) 72 years\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated time of approximately {round(time_astronaut)} years is closest to 81 years.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
