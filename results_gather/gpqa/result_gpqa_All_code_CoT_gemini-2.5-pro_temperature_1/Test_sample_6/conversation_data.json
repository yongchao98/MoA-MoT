    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** The problem describes the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pair. The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$.\n2.  **Apply relativistic kinematics:** To find the minimum (threshold) energy of the high-energy gamma-ray for this process to occur, we use the principle of conservation of four-momentum. The threshold energy is the energy required to create the electron and positron at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n3.  **Derive the threshold energy formula:** For a head-on collision, which provides the lowest possible threshold energy for the high-energy photon, the conservation of energy and momentum leads to the following simple relation:\n    $E_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\epsilon_{CMB} = (m_e c^2)^2$\n    where:\n    *   $E_{\\gamma}$ is the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n    *   $\\epsilon_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n    *   $m_e c^2$ is the rest-mass energy of an electron (which is the same as for a positron).\n4.  **Rearrange the formula:** We can solve for the unknown threshold energy, $E_{\\gamma}$:\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon_{CMB}}$\n5.  **Gather the constants:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n6.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the values into the formula to find $E_{\\gamma}$ in units of electron-volts (eV).\n7.  **Convert units:** The options are given in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). We will convert our result from eV to GeV using the conversion factor $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n8.  **Compare with options:** Match the calculated value to the given choices to find the correct answer.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gamma_ray_threshold_energy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray to annihilate\n    with a CMB photon, producing an electron-positron pair.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the known physical constants in the required units.\n    # Rest-mass energy of an electron (m_e*c^2) in electron-volts (eV).\n    # 0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 1e6 eV\n    m_e_c2_eV = 0.511 * 1e6\n\n    # Average energy of a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon in eV.\n    epsilon_cmb_eV = 1e-3\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the threshold energy of the gamma-ray using the derived formula.\n    # The formula is E_gamma = (m_e*c^2)^2 / epsilon_cmb\n    # The result will be in electron-volts (eV).\n    E_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / epsilon_cmb_eV\n\n    # Step 3: Convert the energy from electron-volts (eV) to Giga-electron-volts (GeV).\n    # 1 GeV = 1e9 eV\n    eV_to_GeV = 1e9\n    E_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / eV_to_GeV\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results and the given options.\n    print(\"Physical Constants Used:\")\n    print(f\"Electron rest-mass energy (m_e*c^2): {m_e_c2_eV / 1e6} MeV\")\n    print(f\"CMB photon energy (epsilon_CMB): {epsilon_cmb_eV} eV\\n\")\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Threshold gamma-ray energy (E_gamma) = (m_e*c^2)^2 / epsilon_CMB\")\n    print(f\"E_gamma = ({m_e_c2_eV:.3e} eV)^2 / {epsilon_cmb_eV:.1e} eV\")\n    print(f\"E_gamma = {E_gamma_eV:.3e} eV\")\n    print(f\"E_gamma = {E_gamma_GeV:.3e} GeV\\n\")\n\n    # Re-format the result to match the options for easier comparison.\n    # E.g., 2.61e5 GeV\n    exponent = math.floor(math.log10(E_gamma_GeV))\n    mantissa = E_gamma_GeV / (10**exponent)\n    \n    print(\"Calculated Threshold Energy:\")\n    print(f\"The threshold energy for the gamma-ray is approximately {mantissa:.1f} * 1e{exponent} GeV.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Comparing with the options:\")\n    print(\"A) 1.8*1e5 GeV\")\n    print(\"B) 9.5*1e4 GeV\")\n    print(\"C) 2.6*1e5 GeV\")\n    print(\"D) 3.9*1e5 GeV\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option C.\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_gamma_ray_threshold_energy()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
