    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Thinking Steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics Principle:** The problem is about distinguishing two quantum energy levels. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation: `ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2`. Here, `ΔE` is the uncertainty in the energy of a state (also called the natural linewidth), `Δt` is the lifetime of the state, and `ħ` (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   For each state, we can calculate its energy uncertainty (`ΔE`) using its given lifetime (`Δt`). We'll use the approximation `ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt`.\n    *   The state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty.\n    *   To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish the two energy levels, the difference in their energies (`|E1 - E2|`) must be significantly larger than the individual energy uncertainties. The larger uncertainty (broader line) is the limiting factor. Therefore, the condition is `|E1 - E2| > ΔE_larger`.\n    *   The state with the shorter lifetime (`t1 = 10^-9` sec) will have the larger energy width (`ΔE1`). We need to calculate this value.\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant (`ħ`) in units of electron-volt seconds (eV·s) is approximately `6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s`. This is the convenient unit to use since the options are in eV.\n\n3.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    *   Calculate `ΔE1 = ħ / t1 = (6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s) / (10^-9 s)`.\n    *   Calculate `ΔE2 = ħ / t2 = (6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s) / (10^-8 s)`.\n    *   `ΔE1` will be the larger value. The required energy difference must be greater than `ΔE1`.\n    *   Compare the calculated `ΔE1` with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the one that satisfies this condition.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the necessary constants and given values.\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\nt1 = 1e-9  # sec\nt2 = 1e-8  # sec\n\n# The options for the energy difference in eV\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-9,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time (ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2).\")\nprint(\"To clearly resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than their energy uncertainties (linewidths).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state.\n# We use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / t1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / t2\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 1 (t1): {t1:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 2 (t2): {t2:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Determine the condition for distinguishability.\n# The state with the shorter lifetime (state 1) has the larger energy width.\n# This larger width is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n# Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than ΔE1.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1\nprint(f\"To be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is {required_separation:.4e} eV.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Compare the options with the required separation.\nprint(\"Checking the options:\")\nvalid_option = None\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {choice}: {value:.1e} eV -> This is greater than {required_separation:.4e} eV.
