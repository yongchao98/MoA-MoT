    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the structure of the final product (4).**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH)**.\n    *   **Step 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **Step 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromine via an SN2 reaction. Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **Step 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   NaH, a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the -CN and -COOEt groups.\n        *   The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the brominated carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   Because NaH is in *excess*, it removes the remaining acidic proton from the alpha-carbon.\n        *   This second carbanion then performs an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to form a stable 6-membered ring.\n        *   The final product (4) is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of Product 4 for 1H NMR signals.**\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: 1) -CN, 2) -COOCH2CH3, 3) the rest of the ring via C2, and 4) the rest of the ring via C6. Therefore, C1 is a **chiral center**.\n    *   Because the molecule is chiral and has two different substituents on C1, there are no planes of symmetry or rotational axes that would make different positions on the ring equivalent.\n\n3.  **Count the distinct hydrogen signals.**\n    *   **Ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the -CH3 group are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the -OCH2- group are considered equivalent for counting purposes (though technically diastereotopic, they are typically observed as one complex signal). This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring protons:**\n        *   The ring has 5 methylene (-CH2-) groups (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6).\n        *   Due to the lack of symmetry, all five of these -CH2- groups are in chemically different environments.\n        *   Within each individual -CH2- group, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different spatial relationships to the substituents on the chiral center C1). Therefore, the two protons of each -CH2- group are chemically distinct and will produce separate signals.\n        *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 non-equivalent -CH2- groups Ã— 2 distinct protons per group = **10 signals**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of signals.**\n    *   Total Signals = (signals from ethyl group) + (signals from ring)\n    *   Total Signals = (1 + 1) + 10 = **12 signals**.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step-by-step derivation of the final product and analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n# Reaction Sequence Analysis:\n# 1.
