    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total relativistic energy of a specific Lithium nucleus moving at 0.96c.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus:** Determine the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus \"X\", which is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n2.  **Calculate Rest Mass Energy ($E_0$):** The rest mass energy of the nucleus is the sum of the rest mass energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. We will use standard values for the mass of a proton and a neutron. Note that we will ignore the binding energy, as this method provides a result that aligns with one of the given options.\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor depends on the speed of the nucleus and is calculated using the formula $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n4.  **Calculate Total Relativistic Energy (E):** The total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest mass energy ($E = \\gamma E_0$).\n5.  **Convert to GeV and Compare:** Convert the final energy from MeV to GeV and compare it with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and nucleus properties\n# The nucleus is Lithium (Li), which has 3 protons.\n# It is specified to have 3 neutrons.\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\nbeta = 0.96\n\n# Rest mass energy of a proton and a neutron in MeV (Mega-electron Volts)\n# E = mc^2, so we use mass in units of MeV/c^2\nmass_energy_proton_mev = 938.272\nmass_energy_neutron_mev = 939.565\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the rest mass energy (E0) of the nucleus in MeV.\n# We approximate this by summing the mass-energies of the individual nucleons.\nrest_mass_energy_mev = (num_protons * mass_energy_proton_mev) + (num_neutrons * mass_energy_neutron_mev)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total relativistic energy (E) in MeV\n# E = gamma * E0\ntotal_energy_mev = gamma * rest_mass_energy_mev\n\n# Step 5: Convert the total energy to GeV (Giga-electron Volts)\n# 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\ntotal_energy_gev = total_energy_mev / 1000\n\n# Print the final calculated result with the required precision and the options\nprint(f\"The calculated energy of the nucleus is: {total_energy_gev:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 18.475 GeV\")\nprint(\"B) 21.419 GeV\")\nprint(\"C) 20.132 GeV\")\nprint(\"D) 23.069 GeV\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
