    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Limiting Shape:** An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a`, as N approaches infinity, becomes a circle. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem, so `R = a`.\n2.  **Apply Diffraction Physics:** The problem is now about Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture. The resulting diffraction pattern is an Airy pattern, characterized by a central bright spot surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n3.  **Find the Minima:** The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`. For small angles, the condition for the n-th minimum is given by:\n    `theta_n = z_n * lambda / (2 * pi * R)`\n    where `lambda` is the wavelength, `R` is the radius of the aperture, and `z_n` is the n-th zero of the `J_1(x)` function.\n4.  **Use Specific Values:**\n    *   The radius of our aperture is `R = a`.\n    *   The first zero of `J_1(x)` is `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`. This corresponds to the first minimum at angle `theta_1`.\n    *   The second zero of `J_1(x)` is `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`. This corresponds to the second minimum at angle `theta_2`.\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n    `Δθ = (z_2 * lambda / (2 * pi * a)) - (z_1 * lambda / (2 * pi * a))`\n    `Δθ = ((z_2 - z_1) / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)`\n6.  **Compute the Coefficient:** We will now calculate the numerical coefficient `(z_2 - z_1) / (2 * pi)` to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima\n# for diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n# The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by theta_n = z_n * lambda / (2 * pi * a),\n# where z_n is the n-th zero of the Bessel function J1(x).\n\n# First zero of J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317\n\n# Second zero of J1(x)\nz2 = 7.0156\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1\n# delta_theta = (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\n\n# Let's calculate the coefficient for (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\n# The options are:\n# A) 0.506 lambda / a\n# B) 0.500 lambda / a\n# C) 1.220 lambda /a\n# D) 0.610 lambda / a\n\nprint(f\"The calculated coefficient is: {coefficient:.3f}\")\nprint(\"The angular distance is approximately {0:.3f} * lambda / a.\".format(coefficient))\nprint(\"Comparing this with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.506\")\nprint(\"B) 0.500\")\nprint(\"C) 1.220\")\nprint(\"D) 0.610\")\nprint(\"The calculated value matches option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
