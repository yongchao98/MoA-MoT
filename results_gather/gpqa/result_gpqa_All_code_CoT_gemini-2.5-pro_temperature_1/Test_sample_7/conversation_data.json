  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the data for Epistasis:** I will first analyze the double-mutant data to determine if any gene is epistatic to another. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant (e.g., g1g2) is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants (e.g., g2). This indicates that the epistatic gene (G2) acts upstream of the other gene (G1) in the same pathway.\n2.  **Identify the Transcription Factor:** The problem states that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Based on the epistasis analysis, the gene that is epistatic to the others is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor.\n3.  **Analyze the G1/G3 Interaction:** I will examine the phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant. If the phenotype is more severe than either single mutant, it suggests a synergistic interaction, which is a hallmark of gene redundancy (i.e., the genes have parallel or overlapping functions). If the phenotype matches one of the single mutants, it would indicate epistasis between them.\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** Finally, I will evaluate each multiple-choice option against the conclusions drawn from the data analysis to find the best fit. I will print out the reasoning for each step and the final choice.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Store the experimental results in a dictionary for easy access.\nresistance_data = {\n    'g1': 75,\n    'g2': 0,\n    'g3': 50,\n    'g1g2': 0,\n    'g1g3': 10,\n    'g2g3': 0\n}\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Analyzing the data to identify the upstream transcription factor via epistasis.\")\nprint(\"Epistasis is when one gene's phenotype masks another's.
