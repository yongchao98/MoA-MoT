    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will review the standard form of Maxwell's equations and explain what each one represents, particularly in terms of divergence (flux) and curl (circulation).\n2.  I will then introduce the hypothetical concept of a magnetic monopole, which is an isolated magnetic charge (like an isolated North or South pole).\n3.  I will analyze how the existence of magnetic monopoles would alter Maxwell's equations by drawing a parallel to how electric charges affect the equations.\n4.  Specifically, Gauss's Law for Magnetism, which states the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ ⋅ **B** = 0), would have to be modified to include a magnetic charge density term.\n5.  By symmetry, Faraday's Law of Induction, which describes the curl of the electric field (∇ × **E**), would also be modified to include a magnetic current term (moving magnetic charges).\n6.  Finally, I will compare these changes to the given multiple-choice options to identify the correct answer and write a Python script to print the explanation and the final choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maxwell_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes how Maxwell's equations change with the existence of magnetic monopoles\n    and prints the correct multiple-choice answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the core concepts\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nMaxwell's equations are a set of fundamental equations that govern electric and magnetic fields. In their standard form, they assume that magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) do not exist.\n\nLet's look at the two equations that would change if magnetic monopoles were discovered:\n\n1.  Gauss's Law for Magnetism:\n    - Standard Form: ∇ ⋅ B = 0\n    - Meaning: The divergence of the magnetic field (B) is zero. This mathematically states that there are no magnetic 'charges' (monopoles) from which field lines can emerge or terminate. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n    - With Monopoles: If a magnetic monopole (a magnetic charge) existed, it would be a source for the magnetic field, just like an electric charge is for the electric field. The equation would change to ∇ ⋅ B ≠ 0, becoming proportional to the magnetic charge density. This equation is directly related to the 'divergence of the magnetic field'.\n\n2.  Faraday's Law of Induction:\n    - Standard Form: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t\n    - Meaning: The curl (or circulation) of the electric field (E) is determined by the rate of change of the magnetic field.\n    - With Monopoles: By symmetry with the Ampère-Maxwell law (which includes electric current), a moving magnetic monopole would constitute a 'magnetic current'. This magnetic current would create a circulating electric field, adding a new term to Faraday's law. Therefore, the equation for the 'circulation of the electric field' would also change.\n\nConclusion:\nThe two equations that would be different are Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of B) and Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of E). This directly corresponds to option D.\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Print the detailed explanation\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(explanation)\n\n    # Print the options provided by the user\n    print(\"--- Question ---\")\n    print(\"In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different.
