    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Establish the relationship between impact parameter and orbital period.** For two planets orbiting the same star in the same plane, their impact parameters (`b`) are related to their semi-major axes (`a`) by `b₂ / b₁ = a₂ / a₁`.\n2.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.** For planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states `P² ∝ a³`, which means the ratio of their semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of their orbital periods (`P`) as `a₂ / a₁ = (P₂ / P₁)⅔`.\n3.  **Combine these relationships.** By substituting the expression from Kepler's Law into the first relationship, we get a direct link between the impact parameters and orbital periods: `b₂ = b₁ * (P₂ / P₁)⅔`.\n4.  **Determine the condition for the maximum period.** The maximum orbital period for the second planet (`P₂_max`) corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter (`b₂_max`) that still allows for a transit. A transit event occurs if the center of the planet passes over the stellar disk. The limiting case is when the planet's center grazes the edge of the star, which corresponds to an impact parameter of `b₂_max = 1`. The information about the planet radii is not needed under this standard simplifying assumption, which leads to one of the provided answers.\n5.  **Solve for the maximum period.** We set `b₂ = 1` in our combined equation and solve for `P₂`:\n    `1 = b₁ * (P₂_max / P₁)⅔`\n    `P₂_max = P₁ * (1 / b₁)^(³⁄₂)`\n6.  **Calculate the final value.** Substitute the known values for the first planet (`P₁ = 3` days, `b₁ = 0.2`) into the formula to find `P₂_max`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_orbital_period():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum orbital period for a second planet to transit a star,\n    given information about a first transiting planet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given data for the first planet\n    p1 = 3.0  # Orbital period in days\n    b1 = 0.2  # Transit impact parameter\n\n    # The condition for the second planet to transit is that its impact parameter, b2,\n    # must be less than or equal to 1 (meaning its center passes over the star's disk).\n    # The maximum period corresponds to the maximum allowed impact parameter, b2_max = 1.\n    b2_max = 1.0\n\n    # We can relate the properties of the two planets.\n    # The relationship between impact parameter (b), period (P), and semi-major axis (a) is:\n    # b is proportional to a (since inclination and stellar radius are constant).\n    # From Kepler's 3rd Law, a is proportional to P^(2/3).\n    # Therefore, b is proportional to P^(2/3).\n    # This gives us the relation: b2 / b1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3).\n\n    # To find the maximum period P2_max, we set b2 = b2_max = 1 and solve for P2:\n    # 1 / b1 = (P2_max / p1)^(2/3)\n    # (1 / b1)^(3/2) = P2_max / p1\n    # P2_max = p1 * (1 / b1)^(3/2)\n\n    # Calculate the maximum period for the second planet\n    p2_max = p1 * (1 / b1)**(1.5)\n\n    print(\"The maximum orbital period of the second planet is:\")\n    print(f\"~ {p2_max:.1f} days\")\n    print(\"\\nThe multiple-choice options are:\")\n    print(\"A) ~ 37.5\")\n    print(\"B) ~ 33.5\")\n    print(\"C) ~ 12.5\")\n    print(\"D) ~ 7.5\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated result corresponds to option B.\")\n\nsolve_orbital_period()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
