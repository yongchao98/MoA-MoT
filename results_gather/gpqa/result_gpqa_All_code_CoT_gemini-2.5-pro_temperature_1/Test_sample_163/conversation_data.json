    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law.** For a spectroscopic binary system that is also eclipsing, the total mass (M) of the system can be related to the orbital period (P) and the sum of the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars (K_total = K_a + K_b). The relationship is `M ∝ P * (K_total)³`. The eclipsing nature of the systems is crucial because it tells us the orbital inclination is near 90 degrees (edge-on), which simplifies the mass calculation formula. All other constants of proportionality will cancel out when we take the ratio of the two systems' masses.\n\n2.  **Assign the given values to variables.** I will create variables for the periods and radial velocity amplitudes for both `system_1` and `system_2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total radial velocity amplitude for each system.** For each system, I'll sum the velocity amplitudes of its two stars.\n    *   `K1_total = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   `K2_total = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the masses.** Using the proportionality from step 1, I will compute the ratio `M1 / M2` as `(P1 * (K1_total)³) / (P2 * (K2_total)³)`.\n\n5.  **Print the result.** The final output will be the calculated numerical factor. I will also compare this factor to the given options to determine the correct choice.\n\n```python\n# Define the observed properties for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # Orbital period in years\nK1a = 10.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 1a in km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # Radial velocity amplitude of star 1b in km/s\n\n# Define the observed properties for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # Orbital period in years\nK2a = 15.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 2a in km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 2b in km/s\n\n# For an eclipsing spectroscopic binary, the total mass M is proportional to P * (K_a + K_b)^3.\n# We want to find the ratio M1 / M2.
