    "The Mott-Gurney equation is a fundamental model for describing space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in insulators and semiconductors. Let's analyze the conditions under which this equation is valid by examining each option.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mott-Gurney Equation's Assumptions:** The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law, $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$, relies on several key assumptions about the device and the charge transport mechanism.\n2.  **Evaluate Option A:** Check if \"negligible drift current\" is a valid assumption.\n3.  **Evaluate Option B:** Check if the model applies to \"two-carrier\" devices.\n4.  **Evaluate Option C:** Check if a \"Schottky contact\" is compatible with the SCLC regime.\n5.  **Evaluate Option D:** Check if all conditions mentioned (\"trap-free\", \"single-carrier\", \"no injection barrier\", \"negligible diffusion\") are consistent with the model's derivation.\n6.  **Identify the Correct Statement:** Based on the analysis, determine which statement accurately describes the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation.\n7.  **Construct the Python Code:** Write a Python script to print the analysis and the final correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_mott_gurney():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation and identifies the correct statement.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime.

The Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC) is fundamentally a drift current driven by the electric field.

The basic Mott-Gurney law is derived for a single-carrier device, where only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current.\",\n        'C': \"Incorrect.

This statement accurately lists the key assumptions for the classic Mott-Gurney law: (1) The material is trap-free. (2) Conduction is dominated by a single type of carrier.
