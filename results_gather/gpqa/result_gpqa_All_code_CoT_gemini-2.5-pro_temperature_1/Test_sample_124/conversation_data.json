    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the system:** The potential `V(r) = 1/2 m ω^2 r^2` describes a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n2.  **Recall the energy eigenvalues:** The energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n    `E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω`\n    where `N = n_x + n_y + n_z` is the principal quantum number (`n_x, n_y, n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...`).\n3.  **Identify the state:**\n    *   The ground state corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for `N=0`.\n    *   The first excited state corresponds to `N=1`.\n    *   The second excited state corresponds to `N=2`.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to `N=3`.\n4.  **Calculate the energy of the third excited state:** We substitute `N=3` into the energy formula:\n    `E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (6/2 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω`\n5.  **Recall the degeneracy formula:** The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level `E_N` (its degeneracy, `g_N`) is the number of ways the non-negative integers `n_x, n_y, n_z` can sum to `N`. The formula for this degeneracy is:\n    `g_N = (N + 1)(N + 2) / 2`\n6.  **Calculate the degeneracy for the third excited state:** We substitute `N=3` into the degeneracy formula:\n    `g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10`\n7.  **Compare results with options:** The calculated energy is `(9/2)ħω` and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option D.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbolic variables for clarity, although they are not strictly needed for the calculation\n# of the coefficients.\nh_bar = sympy.Symbol('hbar')\nomega = sympy.Symbol('omega')\n\n# The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state.\n# For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n# Ground state: N = 0\n# First excited state: N = 1\n# Second excited state: N = 2\n# Third excited state: N = 3\nN = 3\n\n# Calculate the energy of the state N.\n# The formula is E_N = (N + 3/2) * h_bar * omega.\nenergy_coefficient = sympy.Rational(N + 3/2)\nenergy = energy_coefficient * h_bar * omega\n\n# Calculate the degeneracy of the state N.\n# The formula is g_N = (N + 1) * (N + 2) / 2.\ndegeneracy = (N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"The energy of the third excited state (N={N}) is: {energy}\")\nprint(f\"The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for this energy is: {degeneracy}\")\n\n# Compare with the options:\n# A) 11 pi^2 h_bar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n# B) (9/2) h_bar * omega, 3\n# C) 11 pi^2 h_bar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n# D) (9/2) h_bar * omega, 10\n# Our result matches option D.\nprint(\"\\nComparing the results with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) Incorrect energy form.
