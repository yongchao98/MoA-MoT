    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This tells us the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes is 156 amu.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158, which is about 32% of the height of the M+ peak (100%). A M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (since the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75% and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options (using C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35):\n        *   A) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   B) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   C) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n        *   D) C₇H₅ClO₂: (7\\*12) + (5\\*1) + (35) + (2\\*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. (Matches)\n    *   All options have the correct molecular formula and weight. The MS data confirms the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid carbonyl.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the molecule is a carboxylic acid. This rules out option A (aldehyde/phenol) and option D (phenyl chloroformate, which is an acyl chloride/ester hybrid and would lack the broad O-H peak).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical region for a carboxylic acid proton. The integration of 1H (one proton) and its multiplicity as a singlet (s, no adjacent protons) confirms the -COOH group.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The remaining signals are in the aromatic region. We have a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H). The benzene ring must be di-substituted.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern shows two doublets (d), each representing two protons. This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   This NMR data points directly to a para-substituted structure.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom at the para (4) position. This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n        *   MS: Correct molecular weight and has one Cl.\n        *   IR: Has a carboxylic acid group.\n        *   ¹H NMR: Has a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted ring pattern.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted molecule. While it's a carboxylic acid, its four aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the combined spectral evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    # M+ peak at m/z=156 indicates a molecular weight of 156.\n    # The M+2 peak at m/z=158 with 32% intensity (a ~3:1 ratio with M+) is a classic sign of one Chlorine atom.\n    # All four options have the formula C7H5ClO2 and a molecular weight of 156, so all are initially possible.\n\n    # IR Spectroscopy Analysis\n    # A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    # A strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    # This evidence strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid, which rules out:\n    # A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde)\n    # D) Phenyl chloroformate (an acyl chloride/ester)\n\n    # 1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n    # The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    # The signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H) are in the aromatic region.\n    # The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, indicates a symmetrically 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    # Let's check the remaining options against this NMR data:\n    # B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a para-substituted benzoic acid.

This does not match.\n\n    # Final Conclusion\n    # All pieces of evidence (MS, IR, and NMR) point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n    final_choice = 'B'\n    print(f\"The analysis of the spectral data is as follows:\")\n    print(\"1.
