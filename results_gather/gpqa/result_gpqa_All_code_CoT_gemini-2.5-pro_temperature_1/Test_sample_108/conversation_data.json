    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will deconstruct the problem to identify the key principles and quantum numbers involved. The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. It decays into a final NN state and a particle X with intrinsic parity -1.\n2.  I will establish the rules that must be satisfied for a transition to be permitted, based on the information given in the prompt:\n    *   **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state:** The prompt provides a specific rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = (S_f + L_f + 1) % 2`, which means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity before and after the decay must be the same. The initial parity is `P_i = P(NN_i) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`. The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_x`, where `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`, `P(X) = -1` (given), and `l_x` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X. For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`. This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_x) = -1`, meaning `L_f + l_x` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state `1S0` has total angular momentum `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f(NN)`) and the angular momentum of particle X (`j_x`). For `J_f` to be 0, `J_f(NN)` and `j_x` must be coupled to zero, which requires them to have equal magnitudes. We will assume particle X is spinless, so its total angular momentum `j_x` is just its orbital angular momentum `l_x`. Therefore, the condition is `J_f(NN) = l_x`.\n3.  Next, I will write a Python script to systematically check each of the four options (A, B, C, D) against these three rules.\n4.  For each option, the script will:\n    *   Parse the term symbols (`(2S+1)L(J)`) to extract the final spin `S_f`, final orbital angular momentum `L_f`, and final total angular momentum `J_f` for the NN state.\n    *   Determine the orbital angular momentum `l_x` of particle X from its spectroscopic letter.\n    *   Apply the three checks (Pauli, Parity, Angular Momentum).\n5.  Finally, the script will print a detailed analysis for each option, indicating whether it is permitted or not, and will output the single option that is not permitted according to these rules. The option `D) 7D1` contains a spin `S=3` (`2S+1=7`), which is impossible for a two-nucleon system. While this makes the state physically impossible, my analysis will focus on the conservation laws and rules explicitly mentioned in the prompt, as this is the standard way to approach such problems.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef solve_physics_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes nucleon decay channels to find the one that is not permitted.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Helper function to parse spectroscopic notation for angular momentum L\n    def parse_L(L_char):\n        mapping = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3}\n        return mapping.get(L_char.upper(), -1)\n\n    # The four options for the decay channel: 1S0 -> NN_final + X\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\"NN_final\": \"3P0\", \"X_l_char\": \"s\"},\n        \"B\": {\"NN_final\": \"3D3\", \"X_l_char\": \"f\"},\n        \"C\": {\"NN_final\": \"3S1\", \"X_l_char\": \"p\"},\n        \"D\": {\"NN_final\": \"7D1\", \"X_l_char\": \"p\"},\n    }\n\n    # Isospin of the final NN state is given as T_f = 0\n    T_f = 0\n\n    print(\"Analyzing decay channels based on the following rules:\")\n    print(\"1.
