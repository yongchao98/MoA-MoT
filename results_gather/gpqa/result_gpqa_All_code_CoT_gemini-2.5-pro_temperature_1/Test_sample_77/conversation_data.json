    "The problem asks for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` generated by a moving point charge `q`. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n*   A charge `q` is moving along a path `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the potentials at a specific point `r` and time `t`.\n*   Electromagnetic fields travel at the speed of light `c`. This means the field we observe at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time `tr`.\n*   The signal travels a distance `d = |r - s(tr)|` in the time interval `t - tr`. Therefore, `t - tr = d / c`.\n*   The vector `d` is defined as `r - s(tr)`, pointing from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = v(tr)`.\n\n**2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given by:\nScalar Potential (V):\n$$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$$\nVector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):\n$$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$$\nwhere all quantities on the right side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**3. Matching with the Options**\nLet's rearrange the denominator to match the format given in the options:\n$$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\nFor `V`:\n$$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$$\nFor `A`:\n$$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$$\n\n**4. Comparing with the Choices**\n*   A) `V` and `A` have `(dc + d·v)` in the denominator. Incorrect sign.\n*   B) `V` and `A` have `(dc - d·v)` in the denominator. This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n*   C) The expression for `V` is the static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` holds for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the formula for `V` itself is wrong.\n*   D) The expression for `V` is incorrect, and the relation for `A` is dimensionally wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbols used in the problem\nq, c, epsilon_o, mu_o = sp.symbols('q c epsilon_o mu_o')\n# d_vec and v_vec are vectors, d is the magnitude of d_vec\nd_vec = sp.Symbol('d_vec', commutative=False)\nv_vec = sp.Symbol('v_vec', commutative=False)\nd = sp.Symbol('d')\n\n# The standard form of the Lienard-Wiechert potentials\n# We use a placeholder 'R' for the denominator term for clarity\nR = d - (sp.Dot(d_vec, v_vec) / c)\n\n# Scalar Potential V\nV_standard = (1 / (4 * sp.pi * epsilon_o)) * (q / R)\n\n# Vector Potential A\nA_standard = (mu_o / (4 * sp.pi)) * (q * v_vec / R)\n\n# Now, let's re-arrange the denominator to match the options\n# The denominator is R = d - (d_vec . v_vec)/c = (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)/c\ndenominator_rearranged = (d*c - sp.Dot(d_vec, v_vec))\n\n# Substitute the rearranged denominator back into V and A\nV_rearranged = (1 / (4 * sp.pi * epsilon_o)) * (q / (denominator_rearranged / c))\nV_final = sp.simplify(V_rearranged)\n\nA_rearranged = (mu_o / (4 * sp.pi)) * (q * v_vec / (denominator_rearranged / c))\n# Sympy's simplify doesn't handle non-commutative products well in this form,\n# so we manually perform the simplification.\nA_final_numerator = mu_o * q * c * v_vec\nA_final_denominator = 4 * sp.pi * denominator_rearranged\n# A_final would be A_final_numerator / A_final_denominator\n\n# Let's represent the options for comparison\n# Option B\nV_B = (q*c) / (4*sp.pi*epsilon_o * (d*c - sp.Dot(d_vec, v_vec)))\nA_B_num = mu_o * q * c * v_vec\nA_B_den = 4 * sp.pi * (d*c - sp.Dot(d_vec, v_vec))\n\n# The derived expressions match option B.\n# V_final is equal to V_B.\n# A_final (numerator and denominator) matches A_B.\n\n# The correct choice is B.\ncorrect_choice = 'B'\n\nprint(f\"The problem asks for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\")\nprint(f\"The standard textbook formulas are:\")\nprint(f\"V(r, t) = (1 / (4*pi*epsilon_o)) * [q / (d - d.v/c)]\")\nprint(f\"A(r, t) = (mu_o / (4*pi)) * [q*v / (d - d.v/c)]\")\nprint(f\"where d is the distance |r - s(tr)| and d.v is the dot product.\")\nprint(\"\\nRearranging the denominator term gives:\")\nprint(f\"d - d.v/c = (d*c - d.v) / c\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting this back into the potential expressions yields:\")\nprint(f\"V(r,t) = (qc) / (4*pi*epsilon_o * (d*c - d.v))\")\nprint(f\"A(r,t) = (mu_o * q*c * v) / (4*pi * (d*c - d.v))\")\nprint(\"\\nThese expressions match option B.\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<B>>>\")\n```"
