    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N0 * exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `N0` is the initial number of particles and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime when at rest (its proper lifetime `τ`). This is described by the equation `τ_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Relativistic Travel Time:** The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel a distance `d` (the detector radius) is `t = d / v ≈ d / c`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** We can combine these concepts. The fraction of particles reaching the detector is `N/N0`.\n    *   `N/N0 = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    *   Substitute `t = d/c` and `τ_lab = γ * τ`:\n    *   `N/N0 = exp(-(d/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-d / (γ * τ * c))`\n    *   The term `τ * c` is a constant for this type of particle, representing its proper lifetime multiplied by the speed of light. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    *   So, the main equation is: `Fraction = exp(-d / (γ * K))`\n\n3.  **Use the First Case to Find the Constant `K`:**\n    *   We are given: `d = 30` m, `γ1 = 20`, and `Fraction1 = 1/3`.\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * K))`\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we can solve for `K`.\n    *   `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * K)`\n    *   `-ln(3) = -1.5 / K`\n    *   `K = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Use the Second Case to Find the New Lorentz Factor `γ2`:**\n    *   Now we want to find `γ2` when `Fraction2 = 2/3`. We use the same equation and the value of `K` we just found.\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ2 * K))`\n    *   `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ2 * K)`\n    *   `γ2 = -30 / (K * ln(2/3))`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K`:\n    *   `γ2 = -30 / ((1.5 / ln(3)) * ln(2/3))`\n    *   `γ2 = (-30 / 1.5) * (ln(3) / ln(2/3))`\n    *   `γ2 = -20 * (ln(3) / (ln(2) - ln(3)))`\n    *   `γ2 = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n    *   Alternatively, using `ln(2/3) = -ln(1.5)`:\n    *   `γ2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n    *   We will calculate this value using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\n# Case 1\ngamma1 = 20\nfraction1 = 1/3\n\n# Case 2\nfraction2 = 2/3\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The survival fraction equation is: fraction = exp(-d / (gamma * tau_c))\n# where d is distance, gamma is Lorentz factor, and tau_c is a constant (proper lifetime * c).\n# Rearranging the formula: ln(fraction) = -d / (gamma * tau_c)\n# We can form a ratio to eliminate the unknown constants d and tau_c:\n# ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2) = [-d / (gamma1 * tau_c)] / [-d / (gamma2 * tau_c)]\n# ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2) = gamma2 / gamma1\n# So, gamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2))\n\n# Substitute the values\n# Note: log(1/3) is -log(3) and log(2/3) is -log(1.5)\n# The negative signs cancel out.\ngamma2 = gamma1 * (math.log(3) / math.log(1.5))\n\n\n# --- Output the result and the choices ---\nprint(f\"The Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector is: {gamma2:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 28\")\nprint(\"B) 54\")\nprint(\"C) 40\")\nprint(\"D) 68\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19, which corresponds to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
