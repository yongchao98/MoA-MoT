    "My plan is to analyze the phrase \"on top of each other\" from the perspective of a synthetic organic chemist. This phrase is common lab jargon. I will evaluate what common laboratory procedures it might refer to and which physical property of the compounds would lead to this situation.\n\n1.  **Identify the Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. Key activities here include running chemical reactions and then purifying the resulting mixtures.\n2.  **Analyze the Jargon:** \"On top of each other\" is a visual description. It most commonly refers to results from chromatography, specifically Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography. In TLC, compounds appear as spots; if they don't separate, the spots overlap, appearing \"on top of each other.\" In column chromatography, compounds are collected in fractions as they exit the column; if they don't separate, their elution profiles overlap.\n3.  **Relate to Physical Properties:** Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This partitioning is primarily governed by **polarity**. Compounds with similar polarities will behave similarly in a chromatography system and will be very difficult to separate.\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) Non-covalent interactions are the basis of polarity, but \"similar polarities\" is the more direct and specific cause of a failed separation.\n    *   B) Similar polarities directly explain why compounds would fail to separate during chromatography, leading them to be \"on top of each other.\" This is the strongest explanation.\n    *   C) Similar boiling points would be a problem for separation by distillation. While a valid purification challenge, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more characteristic of chromatography.\n    *   D) Optical rotation is a property for characterization, not typically for separation. Compounds are separated based on other properties first, and then their optical rotation might be measured.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The chemist is almost certainly referring to a failed chromatographic separation because the compounds have similar polarities. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. I will now write a python script to present this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_chemistry_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a common piece of organic chemistry lab jargon to determine the correct multiple-choice answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"You overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab.

It works by separating molecules based on their polarity.\n    2.  **How it works:** Compounds are passed through a medium (like silica gel). Less polar compounds travel faster, and more polar compounds travel slower, leading to separation.\n    3.  **The Problem:** If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same speed through the chromatography system. On a TLC plate, their spots will overlap (appear 'on top of each other'). In a column, they will exit at the same time and cannot be collected separately.\n\n    Therefore, the chemist's statement is a complaint that their compounds could not be separated because they have very similar polarities.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    correct_answer_choice = 'B'\n\n    print(question)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    for choice, text in options.items():\n        print(f\"{choice}) {text}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The most likely reason is B: {options[correct_answer_choice]}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice:\")\n    print(correct_answer_choice)\n\nsolve_chemistry_riddle()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
