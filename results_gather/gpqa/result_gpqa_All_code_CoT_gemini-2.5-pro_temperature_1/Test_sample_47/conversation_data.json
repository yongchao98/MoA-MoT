    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to know the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in a final product (Product 4) which is formed through a four-step chemical synthesis. I need to determine the structure of each intermediate product to correctly identify Product 4. Then, I must analyze the structure of Product 4 to count its unique hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in a proton NMR spectrum. Finally, I need to present this logic and the answer in a Python code block.\n\n2.  **Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.**\n        *   This is a classic alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so bromination occurs at one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons next to the C=O group).\n        *   Product 1 is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heat) → Product 2.**\n        *   This involves an α-halo ketone and a base. There are two main possibilities: E2 elimination or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n        *   *Path A (Elimination):* The base could remove the other alpha-proton (at C6) to form an enone (cyclohex-2-en-1-one). If we follow this path, the final product is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which has 4 types of distinct hydrogens (this is not an option).\n        *   *Path B (Favorskii Rearrangement):* This is a very common reaction for α-halo ketones that have a proton on the other α-carbon. The base (OH⁻) removes the proton at C6. The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The nucleophilic base (OH⁻) then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the three-membered ring opens to form the most stable carbanion, resulting in ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n        *   The product is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n        *   Product 2 is **sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate**. Given the options, this pathway is the intended one.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) + Pyridine → Product 3.**\n        *   Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids (or their salts) into acid chlorides. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n        *   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4.**\n        *   LiAl(OtBu)₃H is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without over-reducing them to alcohols.\n        *   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Product's Structure:**\n    *   The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Its structure is a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Now, I need to count the \"chemically distinct\" hydrogen atoms. This means finding all hydrogens that are in a unique chemical environment. We can use symmetry to help.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H-O) and the carbon of the ring it's attached to (C1). This plane bisects the ring through the C3-C4 bond.\n    *   Let's count the unique proton environments:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon connecting the ring to the aldehyde. It's also unique. (1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These are the carbons adjacent to C1. Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 is equivalent to C5. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. Since C1 is a stereocenter, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are diastereotopic, meaning they are not equivalent to each other. So, we have one set of \"cis\" protons (on C2 and C5) and one set of \"trans\" protons (on C2 and C5). This gives 2 more types of hydrogens.\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These are the remaining two carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry. Like C2/C5, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives another 2 types of hydrogens.\n    *   **Total Count:** 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** The calculated number is 6. This matches option D. The logic is sound and follows standard organic chemistry principles. I am ready to write the code. The code will not execute chemical simulations but will print out the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in a final product\n# resulting from a series of reactions.\n# My plan is to determine the structure of the final product and then analyze its symmetry\n# to count the number of unique hydrogen environments.\n\n# Step 1: Define the reaction sequence and identify each product.\n# Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 -> Product 1\n# This is an alpha-bromination of a ketone.
