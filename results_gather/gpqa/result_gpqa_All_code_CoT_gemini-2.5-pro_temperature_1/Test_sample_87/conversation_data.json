    "The scenario describes an active immune response taking place in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) after exposure to an antigen (rotavirus proteins). The key finding is the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells. Let's analyze the options to determine which process this corresponds to.\n\n1.  **Antigen Encounter:** Rotavirus proteins are delivered orally and reach the Peyer's patches, which are key sites for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n2.  **Cell Proliferation:** The presence of proliferating cells indicates that lymphocytes (likely B cells) have recognized the antigen and have become activated.\n3.  **Genetic Change:** The sequenced genes of these cells show \"high variability\" specifically in the \"variable heavy chain gene.\" This region is responsible for binding to the antigen.\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a system of proteins in the blood that enhances the immune response but does not involve mutating the genes of lymphocytes.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of antigen receptors in developing B cells within the bone marrow, *before* they encounter an antigen. The scenario describes a process happening *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which determines the antibody's isotype (e.g., IgM, IgG, IgA). It does not affect the *variable* region, which is where the high variability was observed.\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. SHM intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes. This creates variants of the original B cell receptor, and cells with higher-affinity receptors are selected for survival. This process, known as affinity maturation, directly accounts for the \"high variability\" seen in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\nBased on this analysis, the observed process is somatic hypermutation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_immunology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided scenario to identify the correct immunological process.\n\n    The scenario describes:\n    1. An antigen (rotavirus protein) is introduced to the gut.\n    2. An immune response is initiated in the Peyer's patches (a secondary lymphoid organ).\n    3. Cells involved in the response are proliferating.\n    4. Sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these cells.\n\n    Let's evaluate the options:\n    A) Complement activation: A humoral process that doesn't alter B cell genes.\n    B) VDJ recombination: Occurs in the bone marrow *before* antigen encounter to create initial diversity.\n    C) Class switching recombination: Alters the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region.\n    D) Somatic hypermutation: Introduces numerous point mutations into the *variable* region of immunoglobulin genes in activated, proliferating B cells in secondary lymphoid organs. This perfectly matches the observation of \"high variability.\"\n\n    Therefore, the correct process is Somatic Hypermutation.\n    \"\"\"\n    correct_choice = \"D\"\n    print(\"The scenario describes an active immune response in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure.\")\n    print(\"The key observation is 'high variability' in the 'variable heavy chain gene' of proliferating cells.\")\n    print(\"This process, where point mutations are introduced into the variable region of B cell receptor genes after antigen activation, is known as somatic hypermutation.\")\n    print(\"The correct choice is D.\")\n\nsolve_immunology_question()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
