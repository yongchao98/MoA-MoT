    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical laws:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from its star, the semi-major axis (a). Kepler's Third Law connects the orbital period (P) of a planet to its semi-major axis (a).\n2.  **Establish the relationship between temperature and period:**\n    *   The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states `P² ∝ a³`, which can be rewritten as `a ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n    *   By substituting the expression for 'a' into the temperature relation, we get `T_eq ∝ 1/√(P^(2/3))`, which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ 1/P^(1/3)` or `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n3.  **Formulate the ratio:** The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 can be expressed as:\n    `T_4 / T_2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3)`.\n4.  **Extract the period values from the problem statement:** The orbital period ratios are given as `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. This means the period of Planet_2 (`P_2`) is 2 (in some arbitrary units) and the period of Planet_4 (`P_4`) is 3.5 (in the same units).\n5.  **Calculate the final ratio:** We will use Python to compute `(3.5 / 2)^(-1/3)` and match the result to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the orbital period ratios for Planet 2 and Planet 4 from the given data.\n# The ratio is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5\nperiod_ratio_p2 = 2.0\nperiod_ratio_p4 = 3.5\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 4 to Planet 2.\np4_over_p2 = period_ratio_p4 / period_ratio_p2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n# The relationship is T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, T4 / T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3).\ntemperature_ratio = p4_over_p2 ** (-1/3)\n\n# Step 4: Print the calculated ratio and the given options to find the correct choice.\nprint(f\"The ratio of the orbital periods (P4/P2) is: {p4_over_p2}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T4/T2) is: {temperature_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~0.57\")\nprint(f\"B) ~0.83\")\nprint(f\"C) ~0.69\")\nprint(f\"D) ~0.75\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value ~0.83 matches option B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
