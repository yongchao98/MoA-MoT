    # The total potential energy U_total is the sum of two components:
    # 1. U_interaction: Energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges.
    #    U_interaction = N_sphere * (k * q^2 / R)
    # 2. U_sphere: Mutual energy of the 12 shell charges. For minimum energy, they form an icosahedron.
    #    The energy is given by the solution to the Thomson problem: U_sphere = E_12 * (k * q^2 / R)
    
    # The total energy is the sum of these two components:
    # U_total = U_interaction + U_sphere
    # U_total = (N_sphere * k * q**2 / R) + (E_12 * k * q**2 / R)
