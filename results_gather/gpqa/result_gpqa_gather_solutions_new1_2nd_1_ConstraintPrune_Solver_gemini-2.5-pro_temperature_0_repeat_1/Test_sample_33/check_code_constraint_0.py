    # Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # - Carbocation forms at C4 (tertiary & benzylic, more stable than tertiary C3).
    # - Ethyl group on C3 has higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # - Correct Product A: 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one
    #
    # Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # - Carbocation forms at C3 (stabilized by electron-donating 4-hydroxyphenyl, more stable than C2 stabilized by phenyl).
    # - Phenyl group on C2 has higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # - Correct Product B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one
    #
    # Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
    # - Carbocation forms at C1 (stabilized by two electron-donating anisyl groups, more stable than C2).
    # - Anisyl group on C2 has higher migratory aptitude than phenyl (more electron-rich).
    # - Correct Product C: 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one
