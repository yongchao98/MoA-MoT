    Checks the correctness of the answer for the drug discovery workflow question.

    The question asks for the MOST crucial step BEFORE in silico docking for a complex molecule.
    The key constraints are:
    1.  Workflow Sequence: Steps must be in a logical order.
    2.  Scientific Validity: Assumptions must be sound.
    3.  Cruciality: The step must address the biggest risk or provide the most value.
