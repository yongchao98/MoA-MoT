    # Step 1: Check if the molecular weight of A4 (AuF2) falls into the selected range (C: 220-240).

                f"which does not fall into the selected answer range C ({range_C[0]}-{range_C[1]}).")

    # Step 2: Check the mass percentage of fluorine in the proposed A2 (AuF5).
    # The problem states É·F = 31.96% for A2. A good fit is essential.
    mw_A2 = atomic_masses[A2_formula['element']] + A2_formula['fluorine_atoms'] * atomic_masses['F']

    # Step 3: Check the 1:1 molar ratio reaction constraint.
    # The reaction is Y + A4 -> A5. With the Gold hypothesis, this is Au + AuF2 -> A5.
    # A balanced comproportionation reaction is Au + AuF2 -> 2AuF.
    # The reactants (Y=Au and A4=AuF2) are indeed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This constraint is satisfied.
    # The product A5 is AuF.
    
    # Step 4: Check other qualitative clues for consistency.
    # - "Five binary compounds": Gold is known to form multiple fluorides (AuF, AuF3, AuF5, etc.), making this plausible.
    # - "A1 is bright-red": The proposed A2 is AuF5, which is a red solid. It is chemically consistent that A1, a precursor to A2, would be related and could be red.
    # - "A1/A3 oxidize xenon": Higher gold fluorides like AuF5 are exceptionally strong oxidizing agents, capable of oxidizing xenon. This fits.
    # - "A5 decomposes in water": The product A5 is AuF, which is known to be unstable and disproportionates in water. This fits.

    # --- Compare with the main alternative (Krypton) to confirm the reasoning's strength ---
    # Krypton hypothesis: Y=Kr, A4=KrF4, A2=KrF2
    mw_KrF4 = atomic_masses['Kr'] + 4 * atomic_masses['F'] # ~159.8 g/mol
    # This would lead to option D (140-160), not C.
    
    mw_KrF2 = atomic_masses['Kr'] + 2 * atomic_masses['F'] # ~121.8 g/mol
    percent_F_in_KrF2 = (2 * atomic_masses['F'] / mw_KrF2) * 100 # ~31.2%
    
    # The Krypton hypothesis fails on key qualitative clues:
    # - "Five binary compounds": Krypton only has two well-established binary fluorides.
    # - "A1 is bright-red": A1 would be KrF4, which is a white solid.
    # While the Krypton hypothesis fits the 1:1 reaction, it contradicts more clues than the Gold hypothesis.
    
    # --- Conclusion ---
    # The Gold hypothesis (Y=Au, A4=AuF2) is consistent with all major quantitative and qualitative clues
    # and leads directly to the selected answer C.
