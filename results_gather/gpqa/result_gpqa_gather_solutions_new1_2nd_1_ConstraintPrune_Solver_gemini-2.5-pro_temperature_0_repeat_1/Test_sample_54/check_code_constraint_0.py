Based on the provided answers and a step-by-step analysis of the problem, here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the final answer.

### Step-by-step Analysis

The core of this task is to correctly interpret the provided 1H NMR data. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers is overwhelmingly consistent and correct, even if their final letter choices are not.

**Step 1: Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration)**
This is the first and most effective constraint to apply.
*   The signals in the spectrum integrate to: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = **8 protons**.
*   We check the proton count for the candidate molecules:
    *   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂): Has 8 protons. (Possible)
    *   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂): Has 10 protons. (Not possible)
*   **Conclusion:** This immediately eliminates both butenyl acetate options. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.

**Step 2: Analyze the Coupling Constant (J-value) to Determine Stereochemistry**
This is the most decisive piece of data for distinguishing the remaining two candidates.
*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This coupling arises from the interaction between the two protons on the double bond.
*   The magnitude of this J-coupling is a well-known indicator of alkene geometry:
    *   A **trans** configuration shows a large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.
    *   A **cis** configuration shows a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.
*   **Conclusion:** The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely and unambiguously in the *trans* range. This eliminates the *cis* isomer.

**Step 3: Confirm the Structure with All Signals**
With the compound identified as Trans-propenyl acetate, we verify that all signals are consistent with its structure: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.
*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet for the acetate methyl group (`-C(=O)-CH₃`), which has no adjacent protons. This is a perfect match.
*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet for the terminal methyl group (`=CH-CH₃`), which is split by the single adjacent vinylic proton. This is a perfect match.
*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A doublet of quartets for the vinylic proton next to the methyl group (`=CH-CH₃`). It is split into a doublet by the other *trans* vinylic proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group. This complex pattern is a perfect match.
*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A doublet for the vinylic proton next to the oxygen (`-O-CH=`), split by the other vinylic proton in a *trans* arrangement. This is a perfect match.

### Careful Points
1.  **Proton Count is a Powerful First Filter:** The simple act of summing the integrations (1+1+3+3=8) immediately reduces the possible answers from four to two, significantly pruning the search space.
2.  **The J-Coupling is Decisive:** The coupling constant of 16.0 Hz is the single most important piece of data. It is a classic textbook value for a *trans* relationship between vinylic protons and reliably distinguishes it from a *cis* relationship.
3.  **Inconsistency in Candidate Answers:** The chemical reasoning across all provided answers is sound and converges on the same conclusion: Trans-propenyl acetate. However, the final letter choices (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, `<<<D>>>`) are contradictory. This indicates that the agents were likely working from different or scrambled option lists. Therefore, the final decision must rely on the correct chemical analysis, not the inconsistent letter choices from the agents.
4.  **Final Mapping:** The correct chemical name, **Trans-propenyl acetate**, must be mapped to the specific option list provided in the question.

**Mapping to the Provided Options:**
A) Cis-propenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-butenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

The correct structure, Trans-propenyl acetate, corresponds to option B.
