    Checks the correctness of the selected answer for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.
    
    The function verifies the answer against three key physical constraints:
    1. Retardation: The potential must depend on the retarded distance 'd', not the static distance 'r'.
    2. Doppler Factor Sign: The denominator must have the form (dc - d.v), with a negative sign.
    3. Consistency: The vector potential A must be consistent with the scalar potential V, following the relation A = (v/c^2)V.
