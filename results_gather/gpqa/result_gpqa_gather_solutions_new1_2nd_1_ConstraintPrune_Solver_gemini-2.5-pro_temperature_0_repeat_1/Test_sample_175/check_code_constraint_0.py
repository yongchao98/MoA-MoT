    This function verifies the solution to the quantum mechanics problem.
    It follows the standard procedure for calculating the probability of sequential measurements:
    1. Normalize the initial state vector.
    2. Find the eigenvector for the first measurement outcome (P=0).
    3. Calculate the probability of the first measurement and determine the collapsed state.
    4. Find the eigenvector for the second measurement outcome (Q=-1).
    5. Calculate the probability of the second measurement on the collapsed state.
    6. Multiply the probabilities to get the final joint probability.
    7. Compare the result with the given answer 'A' (1/6).
