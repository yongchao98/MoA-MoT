    Based on an analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and a list of careful points to consider.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    The problem requires a two-part calculation: first, determining the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating spotted star, and second, finding the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce a transit signal of the same amplitude.

    **1. Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Starspots**

    The brightness (or flux, F) of a star's surface is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (F ∝ T⁴).

    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power: `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`, where `T_eff = 6000 K`.
    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. The flux is a weighted average of the unspotted part (80% of the area) and the spotted part (20% of the area). The spot temperature is `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`. The flux is `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`, where `f = 0.20`.
    *   **Amplitude Calculation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux, which simplifies to the formula:
        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`
    *   **Plugging in the values:**
        `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`
        `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`
        `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`
        `Amplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296) ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`
        `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`

    **2. Relate Amplitude to Exoplanet Transit Depth**

    The dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.

    *   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`

    **3. Equate the Signals and Solve for the Relative Radius**

    To produce the same signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude from the starspots.

    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`
    *   To find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we must take the square root of the amplitude:
        `R_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218`

    **4. Compare with Options**

    The calculated value of `~0.3218` is closest to `~0.32`. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:
    *   **A) ~0.32**
    *   B) ~0.11
    *   C) ~0.07
    *   D) ~0.39

    The calculated result matches option A.

    ### Careful Points

    1.  **Radius Ratio vs. Area Ratio (The Square Root Trap):** This is the most critical pitfall. The calculated amplitude (`~0.104`) is the *area* ratio, `(R_pl/R_star)²`. The question asks for the *radius* ratio, `R_pl/R_star`, which requires taking the square root. Option B (`~0.11`) is a distractor that corresponds to the amplitude itself.
    2.  **Flux and Temperature Relationship:** The calculation relies on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where flux is proportional to `T⁴`. Using any other power (e.g., a linear relationship with T) would lead to an incorrect result.
    3.  **Correct Temperature Values:** The spot temperature must be correctly calculated as `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`, not just the temperature difference of 1000 K.
    4.  **Extraneous Information:** The fact that the star's radius is equal to the Sun's is irrelevant to the problem, which asks for a *relative* radius ratio.
    5.  **Inconsistent Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers almost unanimously arrive at the correct numerical result (`~0.32`), but their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent. This is because the options were likely randomized for each agent. The correct approach, taken here, is to trust the robust calculation and map it to the specific options provided in the original prompt.
