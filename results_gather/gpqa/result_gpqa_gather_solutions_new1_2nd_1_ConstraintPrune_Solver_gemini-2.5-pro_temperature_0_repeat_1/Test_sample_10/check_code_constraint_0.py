The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.",
        'B': "SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2... This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.",
        'C': "SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.",
        'D': "The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates."
