Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final, correct answer.

### Step 1: Understand the Core Physical Principle

The question asks to identify which particle is *not* associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry (SSB). The key physical principle connecting particles to SSB is **Goldstone's Theorem**. This theorem states that for every continuous global symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a massless (or very low-mass) particle, called a **Goldstone boson**, must emerge.

Therefore, the question can be rephrased as: "Which of the following particles is not a Goldstone boson (or pseudo-Goldstone boson)?"

### Step 2: Analyze the Consensus Reasoning from Candidate Answers

All 15 candidate answers, despite having different option orderings and occasional errors in their final letter choice, are in **unanimous agreement** on the physical nature of each particle:

*   **Phonon:** Consistently identified as the Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of **continuous translational symmetry** when a crystal lattice forms from free space.
*   **Magnon:** Consistently identified as the Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of **continuous rotational symmetry** when spins align in a ferromagnet.
*   **Pion:** Consistently identified as a **pseudo-Goldstone boson** resulting from the spontaneous breaking of an approximate **chiral symmetry** in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
*   **Skyrmion:** Consistently identified as a **topological soliton**, a fundamentally different class of object from a Goldstone boson.

### Step 3: Identify Careful Points and Nuances

1.  **The Meaning of "Associated With":** The most crucial point is the distinction between being *the result of* SSB versus simply *existing in a system with* SSB. Phonons, magnons, and pions are the direct particle consequences of SSB as described by Goldstone's theorem. A skyrmion, while it can be formed from fields of Goldstone bosons (like pions), is not the Goldstone boson itself. It is a more complex, massive, non-linear excitation.

2.  **Pion as a "Pseudo"-Goldstone Boson:** The pion is not strictly massless. This is because the chiral symmetry it originates from is only approximateâ€”it is also explicitly broken by the small masses of quarks. This makes the pion a *pseudo*-Goldstone boson. However, its existence and relatively low mass are still a direct consequence of SSB, so it is correctly categorized with the others.

3.  **Skyrmion as a Topological Soliton:** This is the key differentiator. A skyrmion is a stable, particle-like "knot" or "twist" in a field. Its stability is guaranteed by a topological property (its "winding number"), not by Goldstone's theorem. It is a non-perturbative object, unlike Goldstone bosons which describe the low-energy, perturbative fluctuations of the system.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude

The unanimous physical reasoning from all candidate answers leads to a clear conclusion: Phonons, Magnons, and Pions are all examples of Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons. Their existence is a direct manifestation of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries.

The **Skyrmion** is the outlier. It is a topological soliton, not a Goldstone boson. Therefore, it is the particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the sense of being its direct particle consequence.

To determine the final answer, we refer to the option list provided in the user's original question:
A) Skyrmion
B) Phonon
C) Magnon
D) Pion

The correct particle is the Skyrmion, which corresponds to option A.
