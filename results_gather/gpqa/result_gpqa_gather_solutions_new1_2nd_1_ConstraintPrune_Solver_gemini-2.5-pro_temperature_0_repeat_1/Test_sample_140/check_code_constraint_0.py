    # --- Step 1: Define the problem constraints and reaction logic ---

    # The strong base (NH2-) abstracts a proton/deuteron from a position ortho to the bromine.
    # The starting material has two distinct ortho positions:
    # - C6 with a Hydrogen (H)
    # - C2 with a Deuterium (D)
    # This leads to two possible benzyne intermediates.

    # (C-H bond is weaker than C-D). The resulting intermediate retains the deuterium at C2.
    # We can represent this as "3-deutero-benzyne".
    intermediates.add("3-deutero-benzyne")
