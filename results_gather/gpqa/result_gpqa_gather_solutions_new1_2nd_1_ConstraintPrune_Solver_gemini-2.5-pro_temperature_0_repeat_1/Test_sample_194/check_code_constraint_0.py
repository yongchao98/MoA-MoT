    # 1. Determine the limiting condition for the second planet's transit.
    # For the maximum period, the planet must be at the maximum orbital radius
    # that still allows a transit. The standard definition for this limit is a
    # grazing transit where the planet's center passes over the star's limb.
    # This corresponds to a maximum impact parameter of 1.

    # 2. Relate the orbits of the two planets.
    # Since both planets share the same orbital plane (same inclination 'i') and
    # orbit the same star (same radius 'R_s'), the ratio of their semi-major axes (a)
    # is equal to the ratio of their impact parameters (b).
    # a2 / a1 = b2 / b1
