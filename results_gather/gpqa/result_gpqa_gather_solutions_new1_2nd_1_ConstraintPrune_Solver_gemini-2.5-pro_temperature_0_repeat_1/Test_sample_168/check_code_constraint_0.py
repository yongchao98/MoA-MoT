Based on a step-by-step analysis of the physics and a review of the candidate answers, here is the definitive solution.

### Step 1: Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)

The first part of the question is to determine if the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous or becomes discrete.

*   **Physical Principle:** In particle decay, the energy spectrum of a decay product is **discrete** (a sharp energy line) only if there are exactly two particles in the final state. If there are three or more particles in the final state, the total decay energy can be shared among them in a continuous range of ways, resulting in a **continuous** energy spectrum for each product.
*   **Original Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`):** The final state consists of the daughter nucleus (2B), two E particles, and two V particles. This is a multi-body final state, which is why the problem correctly states the E particle spectrum is continuous.
*   **Variant Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + M`):** The final state consists of the daughter nucleus (2B), two E particles, and one M particle. This is also a multi-body final state. The total decay energy is shared among these three (or more, if 2B is not a single particle) components.
*   **Conclusion:** Because the variant decay still results in a multi-body final state, the energy spectrum of the E particles must **remain continuous**. This immediately eliminates options A and B.

### Step 2: Analyze the Endpoint of the Spectrum (Increases vs. Decreases)

The second part is to determine if the endpoint of this continuous spectrum increases or decreases.

*   **Physical Principle:** The endpoint of the spectrum represents the maximum possible kinetic energy available to the particles of interest (the two E particles). This maximum kinetic energy is determined by the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value), which is the initial rest mass energy minus the total final rest mass energy, according to `E = mc²`.
*   **Energy Calculation:** Let `Q_nuc = (m_2A - m_2B)c²` be the energy released by the nuclear transition itself. This value is identical for both decays. This energy is then converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the emitted light particles.
    *   **Original Decay Endpoint (Q):** The total kinetic energy available is `Q_nuc` minus the energy needed to create the rest mass of the new light particles.
        `Q = Q_nuc - (2m_E c² + 2m_V c²)`
    *   **Variant Decay Endpoint (Q'):**
        `Q' = Q_nuc - (2m_E c² + m_M c²)`
*   **Comparison:** The problem states that V is a "lighter particle" (implying `m_V > 0`) and M is **massless** (`m_M = 0`). Substituting these values:
    *   `Q = Q_nuc - 2m_E c² - 2m_V c²`
    *   `Q' = Q_nuc - 2m_E c² - 0`
*   **Conclusion:** By direct comparison, `Q'` is greater than `Q` by an amount `2m_V c²`. Since `m_V` is a positive mass, `Q' > Q`. More energy is available as kinetic energy in the variant decay because no energy is "spent" creating the rest mass of the V particles. Therefore, the endpoint of the spectrum **increases**.

### Final Decision

1.  The spectrum **remains continuous**.
2.  The endpoint **increases**.

Combining these two correct deductions, the only matching option is D.

A review of the candidate answers shows that nearly all of them correctly deduce these two physical facts. However, many make a simple logical error when matching their conclusion to the provided options, leading to incorrect final answers despite sound reasoning. The physical analysis is unambiguous.
