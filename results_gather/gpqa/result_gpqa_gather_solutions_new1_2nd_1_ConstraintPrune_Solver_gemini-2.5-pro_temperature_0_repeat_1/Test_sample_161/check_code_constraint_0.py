    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the pseudosphere area problem.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1.  Verifies the logical constraints on the answer options.
    2.  Calculates the area by symbolic integration using SymPy.
    3.  Compares the calculated result with the expected answer (+infinity).
    4.  Confirms that the chosen option 'A' corresponds to this result.

    # The area of a surface must be a single scalar value.
    # Options B and D are functions of coordinates x and y, so they are invalid.

    # for the domain x^2 + y^2 < 4. Integrating a positive function over a
    # non-zero area must yield a positive result, so option C (0) is invalid.
