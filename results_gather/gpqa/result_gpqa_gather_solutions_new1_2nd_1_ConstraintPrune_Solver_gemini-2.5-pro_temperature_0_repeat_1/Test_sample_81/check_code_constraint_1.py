def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer by applying chemical principles
    to the provided options.

    The logic follows a two-step elimination process:
    1.  Check the stereochemistry of the diester group. It must be 'cis' because the reaction
        starts with maleic anhydride (a cis-dienophile). This is determined by parsing the
        stereodescriptors (R/S) at positions 10 and 11 in the IUPAC name. A 'trans'
        configuration (R,R or S,S) is incorrect.
    2.  Check the stereochemistry of the second Diels-Alder addition. The major product results
        from the sterically favored 'anti' addition of cyclopentadiene. The 'syn' addition
        is disfavored. This property is assigned to each candidate based on the consensus
        analysis from the provided LLM answers, as it's difficult to determine from the
        name alone without advanced tools.
