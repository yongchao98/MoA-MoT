    # 2. Perform a step-by-step chemical analysis to find the correct number of stereoisomers.

    # Step 2a: Identify chiral centers (asymmetric carbons).
    # A carbon is chiral if it is bonded to four different groups.
    # Structure: CH3-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3
    # C2: Bonded to two identical methyl groups. Not chiral.
    # C5: Bonded to H, -OH, the group towards C1, and the group towards C11. All four are different. Chiral.
    # C6: Bonded to H, -Cl, the group towards C1, and the group towards C11. All four are different. Chiral.
    # C9: Bonded to H, an ethyl substituent, and the C10-C11 part of the chain (which is also an ethyl group). Not chiral.
    num_chiral_centers = 2

    # Step 2b: Identify stereogenic double bonds (capable of E/Z isomerism).
    # A double bond is stereogenic if each carbon in the bond is attached to two different groups.
    # C3=C4: C3 has H and an isopropyl group. C4 has H and the rest of the chain. Stereogenic.
    # C7=C8: C7 has H and the rest of the chain. C8 has H and a 3-pentyl group. Stereogenic.
    num_stereogenic_double_bonds = 2

    # Step 2c: Check for molecular symmetry.
    # The molecule is asymmetric (e.g., an isopropyl group on one end and a 3-pentyl group on the other).
    # Therefore, no meso compounds are possible, and the 2^n formula is applicable.
    is_symmetric = False

    # 3. Calculate the total number of stereoisomers.
    total_stereocenters = num_chiral_centers + num_stereogenic_double_bonds

        # Since the molecule is asymmetric, we use 2^n.
        correct_number_of_isomers = 2 ** total_stereocenters
