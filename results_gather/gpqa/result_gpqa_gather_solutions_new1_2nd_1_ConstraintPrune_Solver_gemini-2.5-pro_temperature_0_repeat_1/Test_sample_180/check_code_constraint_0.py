    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the solar neutrino flux question.

    This function models the physical scenario described in the question:
    1. The pp-III branch stops, so the Boron-8 (8B) neutrino flux is zero.
    2. The remaining relevant fluxes are from the Beryllium-7 (7Be) line and the CNO cycle.
    3. It calculates the ratio of fluxes in two energy bands based on their known relative magnitudes.

    # --- Step 1: Define the physical model and assumptions ---
    # Based on the problem description and standard solar model data, we can establish
    # the relative contributions to the flux. We can normalize the CNO flux in a 100 keV
    # window to 1 arbitrary unit.
    
    # Let F_CNO_100keV be the flux from the CNO cycle in a 100 keV window.
    # We can set this to a base unit for our calculation.
    F_CNO_100keV = 1.0  # Arbitrary units

    # The problem's solution hinges on the fact that the mono-energetic 7Be line flux
    # is about two orders of magnitude (100x) greater than the CNO flux in a 100 keV band.

    band_2 = (800, 900)  # keV
    energy_7Be = 861  # keV

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the flux in each band ---

    # Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV)
    # The 7Be line at 861 keV is outside this band.
    # The 8B flux is zero.
    # Therefore, only the CNO cycle contributes.
    flux_band_1 = F_CNO_100keV

    # Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV)
    # The 7Be line at 861 keV is inside this band.
    # The 8B flux is zero.
    # The CNO cycle also contributes.
    flux_band_2 = F_7Be_line + F_CNO_100keV
