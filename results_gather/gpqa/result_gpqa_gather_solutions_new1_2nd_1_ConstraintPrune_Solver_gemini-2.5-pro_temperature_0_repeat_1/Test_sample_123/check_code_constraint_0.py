    Checks the correctness of the final answer based on the physics of the problem.
    
    The survival fraction 'f' is related to the Lorentz factor 'gamma' by:
    f = exp(-K / gamma), where K is a constant.
    
    From this, we can derive the relationship between two states (1 and 2):
    ln(f1) = -K / gamma1
    ln(f2) = -K / gamma2
    
    Dividing the two equations gives:
    ln(f1) / ln(f2) = gamma2 / gamma1
    
    So, gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(f1) / ln(f2)
