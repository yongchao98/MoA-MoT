    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the Lyman-alpha redshift problem.

    The function verifies the answer by:
    1. Defining the physical constants: Lyman-alpha rest wavelength and the atmospheric cutoff for ground-based telescopes.
    2. Defining the given options for the redshift 'z'.
    3. Identifying the proposed answer from the LLM.
    4. Calculating which of the options are physically detectable (i.e., result in an observed wavelength above the atmospheric cutoff).
    5. Determining the true "lower limit" by finding the minimum redshift among the detectable options.
    6. Comparing the proposed answer with the calculated correct answer.
