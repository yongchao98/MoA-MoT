    # --- Calculation ---
    # For a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is:
    # 1/d^2 = [ (h^2+k^2+l^2)sin^2(a) + 2(hk+kl+lh)(cos^2(a)-cos(a)) ] / [ a^2(1-3cos^2(a)+2cos^3(a)) ]
    # As noted in the provided analysis, for the specific (111) plane, this simplifies to:
    # 1/d^2 = 3 / [ a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(a)) ]
    # This simplified formula is less prone to calculation errors.
