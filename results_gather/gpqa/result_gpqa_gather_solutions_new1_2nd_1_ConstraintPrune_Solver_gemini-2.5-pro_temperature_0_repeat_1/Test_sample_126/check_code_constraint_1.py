    # 2. Applying the Cope rearrangement mechanism to the reactant '5-butylnona-2,6-diene' involves:
    #    - Breaking the C4-C5 sigma bond.
    #    - Forming a new C2-C7 sigma bond.
    #    - Shifting the pi bonds to C3=C4 and C5=C6.
    # 3. Naming the resulting structure via IUPAC rules yields the following product name. This is the primary constraint.
