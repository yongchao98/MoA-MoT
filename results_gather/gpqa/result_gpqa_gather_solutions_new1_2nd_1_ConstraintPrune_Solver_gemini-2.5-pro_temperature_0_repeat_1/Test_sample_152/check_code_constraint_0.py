    # 1. Define the correct names for products A, B, and reactant C based on chemical principles.
    
    # Reaction A: Michael addition of dimethyl malonate to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.
    # The nucleophile (malonate enolate) attacks the beta-carbon (attached to p-tolyl).
    # The resulting structure is (MeOOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOMe.
    # Naming this as a propane derivative places the p-tolyl group on C2.
    correct_A = "trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate"

    # Reaction B: Stork enamine synthesis followed by acidic workup.
    # The enamine of cyclohexanone attacks but-2-enenitrile. Acidic workup hydrolyzes the
    # intermediate back to a ketone. The keto form is the major, thermodynamically stable product.
    correct_B = "3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile"

    # Reaction C: Retrosynthesis. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
    # The "3-oxobutyl" group comes from the acceptor, but-3-en-2-one.
    # It's attached to C2 of the other reactant. The protons at C2 of a 1,3-dione are highly acidic,
    # so the base deprotonates this position. The reactant C is the stable dione.
