    # 2. Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2).
    # This requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler Effect.
    # Wien's Law: T is proportional to 1/λ_rest => T1/T2 = λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1
    # Doppler Effect: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) for v << c.
    # We are given λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.
    # For Star 1 (v1=0): λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1
    # For Star 2 (v2=700): λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)
    # Therefore: λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)
    # Rearranging for the ratio we need: λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
    # So, the temperature ratio T1/T2 is:
    temperature_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2 / c)

    # 3. Calculate the temperature component of the luminosity ratio.
    # From the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, L is proportional to T^4.
    # So, the temperature component of the ratio L1/L2 is (T1/T2)^4.
    temperature_component = temperature_ratio ** 4
