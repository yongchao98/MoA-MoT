def check_chemistry_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given organic chemistry problem.

    The verification is based on two key chemical principles:
    1.  Reaction 1 (Anionic Oxy-Cope Rearrangement): This is an isomerization, so the product's
        molecular formula must match the starting material's formula.
    2.  Reaction 2 (Ireland-Claisen Rearrangement): The product's state (acid vs. salt) depends
        on the reaction workup. Without a specified acidic workup, the product remains a salt.
