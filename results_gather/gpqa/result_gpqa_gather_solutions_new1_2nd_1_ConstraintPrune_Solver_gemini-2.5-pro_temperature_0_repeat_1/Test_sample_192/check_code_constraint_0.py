    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the astronomy problem.

    The problem involves transforming a number density from parallax space to distance space.
    1.  Given: The number of stars per unit parallax, dN/d(plx), is proportional to 1/plx^5.
    2.  Relationship: Distance r = 1/plx.
    3.  Goal: Find the proportionality for the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr.
    4.  Method: Use the chain rule for densities: dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|.
