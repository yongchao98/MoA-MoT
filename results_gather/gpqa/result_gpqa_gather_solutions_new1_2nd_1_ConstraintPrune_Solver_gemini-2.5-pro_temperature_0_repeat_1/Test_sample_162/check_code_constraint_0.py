    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the Fe(OH)3 dissolution problem.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 from the given mass.
    2. Calculate the moles of H+ required for the stoichiometric reaction.
    3. For each option (A, B, C, D), calculate the total moles of H+ that would be
       theoretically required to both complete the reaction and establish the given pH.
    4. Convert this required mole amount back into a required volume of 0.1 M acid.
    5. Compare this calculated volume with the volume given in the option.
    6. The correct option is the one where the given volume and calculated volume match.
