def check_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the RHIC energy problem.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the problem parameters (speed, options) and physical constants.
    2. Calculates the Lorentz factor (gamma) for the given speed.
    3. Calculates the rest energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus using the simplified model
       (sum of constituent nucleon masses), as this is the method intended for
       this type of multiple-choice question.
    4. Calculates the total relativistic energy.
    5. Compares the calculated energy to the given options to find the best fit.
    6. Checks if the provided answer matches the best-fit option.
    7. Verifies that the difference between the calculated value and the chosen option
       is small enough to be attributable to variations in physical constants.
