The script correctly identified this as the final choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Chemical Reactions**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the stereochemical outcome of the two-step reaction sequence (mCPBA followed by aqueous acid) on two different starting stereoisomers. This sequence is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n\n**1. Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n*   **Transformation:** The alkene undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n*   **Transformation:** The alkene undergoes the same anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is critical:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds.\n\n### **Analysis of the Chromatograms**\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The meso-diol will have a different polarity and size profile than the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, eluting as a distinct peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own distinct peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Key Chemical Principle:** The problem hinges on knowing the stereochemical outcomes of anti-dihydroxylation on cis and trans alkenes.\n*   **Key Analytical Principle:** The core of the analysis is understanding that standard HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers, while chiral HPLC separates both.\n*   **Final Tally:** The analysis consistently leads to the conclusion of 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n*   **Candidate Answer Review:** A review of the provided candidate answers shows that while most of them contain the correct chemical reasoning, several make an error in selecting the final multiple-choice letter that corresponds to their own analysis. The correct reasoning aligns only with option C.\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Reactions**\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand the stereochemical outcome of the two-step reaction sequence: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water. This sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical, achiral *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetrical *trans*-alkene yields a **meso compound**.\n*   **Product:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: meso-octane-4,5-diol. This compound has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical, achiral *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetrical *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two chiral compounds that are mirror images of each other: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the Chromatographic Observations**\n\n**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Diastereomers (like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and a second for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The chiral column can distinguish between all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   The meso-diol will give one peak.\n    *   The (4R,5R)-enantiomer will give a second peak.\n    *   The (4S,5S)-enantiomer will give a third peak.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The reaction sequence (mCPBA then HâOâº) must be correctly identified as an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   The stereochemical rules for addition reactions to cis and trans alkenes must be applied correctly (Trans + Anti â Meso; Cis + Anti â Racemic).\n*   The fundamental difference between achiral and chiral chromatography must be understood: achiral columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers, while chiral columns separate both.\n*   The final count of peaks must be carefully matched to the given multiple-choice options.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, highlighting the key points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Overall Reaction**\nThe process involves two steps:\n1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid), which is an epoxidation reaction. This is a **syn-addition** of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (HâOâº), which causes an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an **anti-addition** of a hydroxyl group (from water).\n\nThe combination of a syn-epoxidation followed by an anti-ring-opening results in an overall **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene (the two -OH groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Product of Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Product of Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the other two, while the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\n**A. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and a second peak for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   It can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will resolve all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture. This will result in **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows there will be 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Reaction Stereochemistry:** It is critical to correctly identify the overall reaction as an anti-dihydroxylation and apply the proper stereochemical rules (trans-alkene + anti-addition â meso; cis-alkene + anti-addition â racemic).\n*   **Mixture Composition:** The final mixture contains three stereoisomers, not two or four. It is composed of one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers.\n*   **HPLC Separation Principles:** One must clearly distinguish between the capabilities of achiral and chiral chromatography. Achiral columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers. Chiral columns separate both.\n*   **Matching Analysis to Options:** After determining the outcome (2 peaks and 3 peaks), it is essential to select the correct corresponding option from the list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction 1.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening with aqueous acid (HâOâº). This sequence is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-known stereochemical rule for this type of reaction: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction 2.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. It is also a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same, so the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is: the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture.**\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions.

(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the outcome of the standard (achiral) HPLC.**\n*   A standard HPLC column uses an achiral stationary phase.

The net result of this sequence is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product of Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n*   **Product 1:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product of Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product 2:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is crucial:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers**.\n*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Separation of Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot** be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Separation of Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties. Therefore, they **can** be separated and will elute at different times.\n*   **Prediction:** The racemic pair ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the pair, will have different properties and will elute as a second, separate peak.\n*   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed.\n\n**Step 6: Predict the Chromatogram for Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n*   **Separation:** A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers from one another. It separates diastereomers and also resolves enantiomers.\n*   **Prediction:** All three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.

    "Based on an analysis of the candidate answers, there is a strong consensus on the underlying chemical principles, but significant confusion in matching the correct reasoning to the final multiple-choice letter. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to resolve the task.\n\n### **Constraint Modeling**\n\nThe problem can be modeled by applying a series of constraints derived from stereochemistry and analytical chemistry principles. Each constraint will prune the set of possible answers {A, B, C, D}.\n\n**Constraint 1: Identify the products of each reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) undergoes *anti*-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a **meso** compound.\n    *   Product 1: A single, achiral compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n*   **Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) undergoes *anti*-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 pair of enantiomers).\n    *   Product 2: A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Constraint 2: Characterize the final product mixture.**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers: one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n**Constraint 3: Predict the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram.**\n\nA standard HPLC column separates molecules based on differences in physical properties.\n*   **Principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n*   **Application:** The meso-diol (diastereomer) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed.\n\n*   **Pruning:** This constraint eliminates options A (4 peaks) and C (3 peaks). The remaining candidates are B and D.\n\n**Constraint 4: Predict the chiral HPLC chromatogram.**\n\nA chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment.\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Application:** All three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n*   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed.\n\n*   **Pruning:** This constraint eliminates option D (2 peaks). The only remaining candidate is B.\n\n### **Final Check and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Reaction Stereochemistry:** The reaction sequence (mCPBA then HâOâº) must be correctly identified as an *anti*-dihydroxylation. The rules *trans* + *anti* â *meso* and *cis* + *anti* â *racemic* are critical.\n*   **Mixture Composition:** The final mixture contains exactly three stereoisomers: one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Chromatography Principles:** The distinction between achiral and chiral chromatography is fundamental. Achiral separates diastereomers; chiral separates both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Matching Conclusion to Options:** The derived conclusion is **2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**. This must be carefully matched to the provided options.\n    *   A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n    *   B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\n    *   C) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n    *   D) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe analysis perfectly matches option B. Many of the candidate answers derived the correct number of peaks but failed at this final matching step.\n\n### **Constraint Pass/Fail Summary**\n\n*   **Candidate A:** Fails Constraint 3 (predicts 4 standard peaks, should be 2).\n*   **Candidate B:** **PASSES** all constraints.\n*   **Candidate C:** Fails Constraint 3 (predicts 3 standard peaks, should be 2).\n*   **Candidate D:** Fails Constraint 4 (predicts 2 chiral peaks, should be 3).\n\n<<<B>>>"

This sequence is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n\n**1. Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n*   **Transformation:** The alkene undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n*   **Transformation:** The alkene undergoes the same anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is critical:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds.\n\n### **Analysis of the Chromatograms**\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The meso-diol will have a different polarity and size profile than the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, eluting as a distinct peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own distinct peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Key Chemical Principle:** The problem hinges on knowing the stereochemical outcomes of anti-dihydroxylation on cis and trans alkenes.\n*   **Key Analytical Principle:** The core of the analysis is understanding that standard HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers, while chiral HPLC separates both.\n*   **Final Tally:** The analysis consistently leads to the conclusion of 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n*   **Candidate Answer Review:** A review of the provided candidate answers shows that while most of them contain the correct chemical reasoning, several make an error in selecting the final multiple-choice letter that corresponds to their own analysis.

This sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical, achiral *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetrical *trans*-alkene yields a **meso compound**.\n*   **Product:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: meso-octane-4,5-diol. This compound has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical, achiral *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetrical *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two chiral compounds that are mirror images of each other: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the Chromatographic Observations**\n\n**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.

It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The chiral column can distinguish between all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   The meso-diol will give one peak.\n    *   The (4R,5R)-enantiomer will give a second peak.\n    *   The (4S,5S)-enantiomer will give a third peak.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.

Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid), which is an epoxidation reaction. This is a **syn-addition** of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (HâOâº), which causes an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an **anti-addition** of a hydroxyl group (from water).\n\nThe combination of a syn-epoxidation followed by an anti-ring-opening results in an overall **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene (the two -OH groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Product of Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Product of Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the other two, while the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\n**A. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.

This will result in **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows there will be 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.

It is composed of one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers.\n*   **HPLC Separation Principles:** One must clearly distinguish between the capabilities of achiral and chiral chromatography.

Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).\n2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (HâOâº).\n\nThis sequence achieves the dihydroxylation of an alkene. The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn*-addition. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water, is an *anti*-addition. The net result of this sequence is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product of Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n*   **Product 1:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product of Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n*   **Product 2:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions.

Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two compounds.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will co-elute.\n*   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and a second peak for the unresolved enantiomeric pair.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:** All three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n*   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Summary:** The analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n*   **Matching the Option:** This result corresponds directly to option A.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  Correctly identify the overall reaction as an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    2.  Apply the correct stereochemical rules: *trans*-alkene + anti-addition â *meso* compound; *cis*-alkene + anti-addition â *racemic* mixture.\n    3.  Understand the composition of the final mixture: one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers.\n    4.  Know the separation capabilities of HPLC: standard (achiral) columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers, while chiral columns separate both.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Overall Transformation:** The question describes a two-step reaction sequence:\n    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is an epoxidation reaction, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (HâOâº). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide, which is an *anti*-addition of water (the -OH group).\n    The net result of this sequence is the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene (the addition of two -OH groups, one on each side of the original double bond).\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A key rule in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (assuming the alkene is symmetrically substituted, which it is). A helpful mnemonic is **T**rans + **A**nti â **M**eso (TAM).\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding rule is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers. A helpful mnemonic is **C**is + **A**nti â **R**acemic (CAR).\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n5.  **Predict the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Chromatogram**\n    *   **Principle:** A standard HPLC column uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different physical properties (like polarity), but it cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   **Application:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two compounds. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n    *   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   **Application:** The chiral column will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture. The meso-diol will have its own peak, and the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated into two additional distinct peaks.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the final product mixture will produce **2 peaks** in a standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** in a chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
