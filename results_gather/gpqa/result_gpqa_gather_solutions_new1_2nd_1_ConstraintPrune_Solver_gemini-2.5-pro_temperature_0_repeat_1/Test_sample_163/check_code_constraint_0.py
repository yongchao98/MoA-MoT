    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, modeling the task as a series of constraints to prune the search space and arrive at a definitive answer.

    ### Step 1: Define Constraints from the Problem Statement

    1.  **Physical System:** The problem describes two double-lined spectroscopic binary star systems.
    2.  **Key Observation:** Both systems are "eclipsing". This is a critical constraint, as it implies the orbital inclination angle (`i`) is approximately 90 degrees.
    3.  **Goal:** Calculate the ratio of the total mass of system 1 to the total mass of system 2 (`M_sys1 / M_sys2`).
    4.  **Data for System 1:** Period `P1 = 2` years. Radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s.
    5.  **Data for System 2:** Period `P2 = 1` year. Radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s.
    6.  **Answer Format:** The final answer must be one of the provided options: A) ~0.4, B) ~1.2, C) ~0.6, D) ~0.7.

    ### Step 2: Pruning the Search Space with Physical Laws

    The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is given by the formula:
    `M_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)`

    The "eclipsing" constraint (Constraint 2) simplifies this significantly. For an eclipsing binary, `i ≈ 90°`, which means `sin(i) ≈ 1` and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This prunes away the complexity of the unknown inclination angle.

    When calculating the ratio `M_sys1 / M_sys2`, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` and the `sin³(i)` term (which is ~1 for both) cancel out. This leaves a simple proportionality:

    `M_total ∝ P * (K_sum)³`

    This proportionality is the only model needed to solve the problem.

    ### Step 3: Iteration with Tighter Constraints (Code Verification)

    ```python
    # Constraint 1: Define system parameters from the problem statement.
    P1 = 2.0  # Period of system 1 in years
    K1_sum = 10.0 + 5.0  # Sum of RV amplitudes for system 1 in km/s

    P2 = 1.0  # Period of system 2 in years
    K2_sum = 15.0 + 10.0  # Sum of RV amplitudes for system 2 in km/s

    print("--- Data Extraction ---")
    print(f"System 1: P1 = {P1}, K_sum1 = {K1_sum}")
    print("Pass/Fail: Pass\n")
    print(f"System 2: P2 = {P2}, K_sum2 = {K2_sum}")
    print("Pass/Fail: Pass\n")

    # Constraint 2: Apply the derived physical model.
    # M_ratio = (P1 * K1_sum^3) / (P2 * K2_sum^3)
    # This is based on the simplification for eclipsing binaries where sin(i) ~ 1.
    theoretical_ratio = (P1 * (K1_sum**3)) / (P2 * (K2_sum**3))

    print("--- Model Calculation ---")
    print(f"Calculated Mass Ratio (M1/M2): {theoretical_ratio:.4f}")
    print("Pass/Fail: Pass\n")

    # Constraint 3: Check the candidate answers against the calculated ratio.
    # The options from the prompt are A) ~0.4, B) ~1.2, C) ~0.6, D) ~0.7
    options = {
        "A": 0.4,
        "B": 1.2,
        "C": 0.6,
        "D": 0.7
    }

    print("--- Candidate Verification ---")
    # Find the option with the minimum absolute difference from the theoretical value.
    closest_option_label = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - theoretical_ratio))

    for option, value in options.items():
        status = "Pass" if option == closest_option_label else "Fail"
        print(f"Candidate {option} ({value}): {status}")

    print(f"\nFinal Conclusion: The calculated ratio {theoretical_ratio:.4f} is closest to option {closest_option_label} ({options[closest_option_label]}).")
    ```

    ### Analysis and Final Answer

    1.  **Consensus in Calculation:** All provided candidate answers correctly identify the physical principles and perform the calculation, arriving at the numerical result of **0.432**.
    2.  **Source of Discrepancy:** The differences in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers are due to randomized ordering of the options in their respective prompts.
    3.  **Definitive Result:** The calculation `(2 * 15³) / (1 * 25³)` unambiguously yields `0.432`.
    4.  **Matching to Options:** Comparing this result to the options provided in the question (`A) ~ 0.4`, `B) ~ 1.2`, `C) ~ 0.6`, `D) ~ 0.7`), the value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.

    Therefore, the correct option is A.
