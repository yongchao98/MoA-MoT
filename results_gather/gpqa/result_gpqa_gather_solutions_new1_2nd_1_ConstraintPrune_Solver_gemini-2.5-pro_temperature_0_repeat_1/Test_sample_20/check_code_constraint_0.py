    Here is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer, incorporating careful points observed from the candidate answers.

    ### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Task into Constraints**

    The task requires identifying two compounds, (A) and (B), based on two separate chemical properties.

    *   **Constraint 1 (for Compound A):** The compound must **not** show tautomerism. The candidates are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.
    *   **Constraint 2 (for Compound B):** The compound **must** show optical isomerism. The candidates are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

    ### **Step 2: Apply Constraint 1 (Tautomerism)**

    This step will determine Compound A and prune the available options.

    *   **Principle:** Keto-enol tautomerism requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen), typically on an sp³-hybridized carbon.
    *   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and have no attached hydrogens. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.
    *   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a saturated ring with three C=O groups. The carbons between the carbonyls are -CH₂- groups. These are sp³-hybridized carbons with two α-hydrogens each. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.

    **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

    **Pruning:** This result eliminates options A and B, as they incorrectly identify compound A.
    *   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate -> **Fail**
    *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate -> **Fail**
    *   C) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate -> **Pass**
    *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate -> **Pass**

    ### **Step 3: Apply Constraint 2 (Optical Isomerism)**

    This step will determine Compound B and prune the remaining options.

    *   **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups.
    *   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: (-H), (-OH), (-CH₃), and (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.
    *   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (trans isomer). This molecule is planar and has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.

    **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    **Pruning:** This result eliminates option D from the remaining candidates.
    *   C) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate -> **Pass**
    *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate -> **Fail**

    ### **Step 4: Final Decision and Careful Points**

    The only option that satisfies both constraints is C.

    *   **Final Answer Pair:** A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
    *   **Matching Option:** This pair corresponds exactly to option C.

    **Careful Points from Analysis:**
    1.  **Tautomerism vs. Redox:** The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (change in molecular formula), not tautomerism (which is an isomerization).
    2.  **Chirality:** Optical isomerism requires chirality. Dimethyl fumarate is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), but it is not an optical isomer because it is achiral.
    3.  **Mapping Error:** A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical analysis was almost universally correct, many agents failed to correctly map their conclusion (A=benzoquinone, B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) to the corresponding lettered option. This clerical error is the main source of disagreement among the candidates' final outputs.
