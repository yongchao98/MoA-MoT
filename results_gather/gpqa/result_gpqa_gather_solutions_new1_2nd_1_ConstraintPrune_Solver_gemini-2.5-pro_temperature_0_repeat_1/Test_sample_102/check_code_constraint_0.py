    This function programmatically checks the chemical validity of proposed synthesis routes

    It simulates each reaction step based on fundamental rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution:
    1.  Directing effects of substituents (ortho, para vs. meta).
    2.  Activating/deactivating nature of substituents.
    3.  Known reaction constraints (e.g., Friedel-Crafts reaction failures).
