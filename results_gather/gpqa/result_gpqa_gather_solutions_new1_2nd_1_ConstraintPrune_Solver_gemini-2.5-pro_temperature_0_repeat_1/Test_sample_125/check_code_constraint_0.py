    # --- Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I ---
    # Reactant: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It has one pre-existing stereocenter (C5).
    # Reaction: Reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter.
    # Products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
    # Relationship: These are diastereomers.
    # Conclusion: Reaction I produces 2 distinct stereoisomers.

    # Products: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.
    # Relationship: (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers. (2R, 4S) is a meso compound.
