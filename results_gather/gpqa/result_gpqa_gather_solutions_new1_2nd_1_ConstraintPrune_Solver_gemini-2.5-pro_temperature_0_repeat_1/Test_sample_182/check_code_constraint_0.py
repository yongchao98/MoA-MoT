    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question about the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: Deconstruct the name "2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid" to find all sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds).
        - 'cyclohex-': 1 ring.
        - '-3-ene': 1 C=C pi bond.
        - 'vinyl': 1 C=C pi bond.
        - 'formyl': 1 C=O pi bond.
        - 'carboxylic acid': 1 C=O pi bond.
    2.  **Analyze the Reaction**: The reagent "red phosphorus and excess of HI" is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces all pi bonds (C=C and C=O) to single bonds but does not break stable cycloalkane rings.
    3.  **Calculate the Product's IHD**: Based on the reaction, the product will have 0 pi bonds, but the single ring will remain. The final IHD is the sum of rings and pi bonds in the product.
    4.  **Verify the Answer**: Compare the calculated IHD with the value from the selected option.
