### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence

1.  **Step 1: Diene Generation.** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is a reductive elimination. This process generates a highly reactive diene *in situ*. The most plausible product is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**, an isomer of C₈H₈ commonly known as **o-quinodimethane** or **o-xylylene**. This step is correctly identified by most candidate answers.

2.  **Step 2: Double Diels-Alder Reaction.** The generated o-quinodimethane (diene) reacts with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (dienophile). The use of **2 equivalents** of the diene precursor is a critical piece of information, indicating that a **double Diels-Alder reaction** occurs. Two molecules of the diene add across the two double bonds of the norbornadiene core, forming a large, polycyclic bis-adduct, **Product 1**.

3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether, converting the `-OtBu` group to a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group, yielding **Product 2**.

4.  **Step 4: Oxidation.** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃•pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol of Product 2 into a ketone (`C=O`), yielding **Product 3**.

5.  **Step 5: Thermal Fragmentation and Subsequent Reactions.** This is the most complex and decisive step.
    *   **Retro-Diels-Alder:** Heating Product 3 to 150°C induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, causing the molecule to fragment into its constituent parts.
    *   **Initial Fragments:** The fragmentation regenerates two molecules of the diene (**o-quinodimethane**) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile (**bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**, also known as 7-oxonorbornadiene).
    *   **Fate of Fragments:** Both fragments are highly reactive and are not the final, stable product.
        *   **7-oxonorbornadiene** is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**. This is a key, irreversible step that drives the overall fragmentation.
        *   **o-quinodimethane** is also extremely reactive and cannot be isolated. The two molecules generated will rapidly react further.

### Analysis of Final Product 4 and its Symmetry

The question asks for the analysis of the "final product 4". Since benzene and CO are byproducts, "Product 4" must be the stable molecule formed from the reactive o-quinodimethane intermediate. There are several chemically plausible pathways for this transformation, and a careful analysis reveals they converge on the same answer.

*   **Pathway A: Dimerization.** The most common fate for o-quinodimethane generated under these conditions is dimerization. The major product is **dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene**, formed via a [4+4] cycloaddition.
    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule adopts a stable, puckered "tub" conformation with **C₂ symmetry**.
    *   **Hydrogen Count:** The C₂ axis relates the two halves of the molecule. This results in 4 distinct aromatic hydrogen environments and 4 distinct aliphatic hydrogen environments. Total = **8 distinct hydrogen atoms**.

*   **Pathway B: Trapping.** It is also plausible that one molecule of o-quinodimethane (diene) "traps" the 7-oxonorbornadiene (dienophile) in a new Diels-Alder reaction before the latter can decompose.
    *   **Symmetry:** The resulting adduct possesses a **Cₛ plane of symmetry**.
    *   **Hydrogen Count:** Analysis of this Cₛ-symmetric structure also reveals a total of **8 distinct hydrogen atoms**, as correctly reasoned in answers like 4 and 6.

*   **Pathway C: Rearrangement.** A reactive C₈H₈ isomer like o-quinodimethane could also rearrange to a more stable isomer, such as **2-vinylfulvene**.
    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no symmetry elements (**C₁ symmetry**).
    *   **Hydrogen Count:** A molecule with no symmetry has all of its atoms in unique environments. Since it has 8 hydrogen atoms, it would have **8 distinct hydrogen atoms**.

### Conclusion

The overwhelming majority of candidate answers (13 out of 15) correctly deduce that the final product has 8 distinct hydrogen atoms. This conclusion is exceptionally robust because multiple, independent, and chemically plausible pathways for the final reaction step all converge on a product with **8** distinct hydrogen environments. The minority answers suggesting 4 distinct hydrogens rely on either prematurely stopping the reaction at a reactive intermediate or an incorrect symmetry analysis of the final product.

Therefore, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product 4 is 8. This corresponds to option D.
