    # --- Step 1: Define physical principles ---

    # Principle 1: Relative Motion Factor (√2)
    # The ratio λ2/λ1 contains a √2 factor because λ1 (gas-gas) accounts for
    # relative motion of all particles, while λ2 (electron-gas) does not, as
    # gas molecules are effectively stationary targets for high-energy electrons.
    # λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg
    relative_motion_factor = math.sqrt(2)

    # Principle 2: Cross-Section Ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg)
    # The kinetic cross-section for two molecules (σ_gg) is significantly LARGER
    # than the scattering cross-section for a highly penetrating 1000 keV electron (σ_eg).
    # Therefore, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a value greater than 1.
    # We represent this as a logical condition.

    # --- Step 2: Derive the final relationship ---

    # The ratio λ2 / λ1 = relative_motion_factor * (σ_gg / σ_eg)
    # Since (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1, the minimum possible value for the ratio λ2 / λ1
    # is just greater than the relative_motion_factor itself.
    # So, λ2 / λ1 > √2 ≈ 1.414
    min_ratio_lambda2_to_lambda1 = relative_motion_factor

    # --- Step 3: Evaluate the options from the question ---

    # Option A: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  =>  1 < λ2/λ1 < 1.22
