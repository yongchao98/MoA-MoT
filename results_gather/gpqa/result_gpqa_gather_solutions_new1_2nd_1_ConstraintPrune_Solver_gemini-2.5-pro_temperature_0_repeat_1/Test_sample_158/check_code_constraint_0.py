    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the cosmology question.

    1. Calculates the redshift (z) based on the observed and rest wavelengths of the Lyman-alpha line.
    2. Defines the integrand for the comoving distance calculation in a flat Lambda-CDM universe.
    3. Numerically integrates to find the comoving distance using the given cosmological parameters.
