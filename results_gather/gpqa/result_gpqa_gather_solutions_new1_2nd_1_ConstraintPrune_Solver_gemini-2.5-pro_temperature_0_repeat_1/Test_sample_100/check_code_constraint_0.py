    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # The reaction is an enamine synthesis from a secondary amine and a carbonyl.
    # 3-methylpyrrolidine (secondary amine) + A (carbonyl) --(B, Heat)--> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine (enamine)

    # --- Chemical Knowledge and Constraints ---
    # Constraint 1: The reaction is an enamine synthesis, which requires a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone) as reagent A.
    # 'vinylcyclohexane' is an alkene, not a carbonyl compound.
    # 'cyclohexanecarbaldehyde' is an aldehyde, a carbonyl compound.
    
    # Constraint 2: The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration. A strong acid is more effective and standard for this transformation than a weak acid, especially with heating.
    # 'TsOH' (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid.
    # 'Acetic acid' is a weak acid.
