  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H10O2\nB) C6H10O\nC) C6H12O2\nD) C6H12O\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nBased on the logic that would be executed by the Python script:\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script begins by considering all four provided chemical formulas as potential candidates: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.\n\n2.  **Constraint 1: Presence of a Carboxylic Acid:**\n    *   The FTIR data (very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹) and the Mass Spectrometry data (fragment at m/z = 45) provide strong, converging evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This constraint filters out any formulas with only one oxygen atom.\n    *   **Eliminated:** C6H12O, C6H10O.\n    *   **Surviving Candidates:** C6H10O2, C6H12O2.\n\n3.  **Constraint 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The FTIR data (peak at 1650 cm⁻¹) and the 1H NMR data (vinyl hydrogens) confirm the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The molecule must therefore contain at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n    *   The script calculates the DoU for the remaining candidates:\n        *   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is insufficient to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond. This candidate is eliminated.\n        *   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This perfectly matches the two degrees of unsaturation required by the evidence.\n\n4.  **Final Choice:**\n    *   After applying all constraints, only one candidate survives: **C6H10O2**.\n    *   This corresponds to option D in the original question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe first step is to interpret what each piece of spectroscopic data tells us about the unknown compound's functional groups.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it reinforces the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This directly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total=45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Findings and Establish Requirements\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown molecule must have the following features:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means it must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C), which is a double bond.\n3.  The carboxylic acid's carbonyl group (C=O) is also a double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the four options against the requirements established in Step 2.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Must have two oxygen atoms.**\n    *   C6H12O (D) and C6H10O (C) only have one oxygen atom. They are eliminated.\n    *   The remaining candidates are **C6H10O2 (A)** and **C6H12O2 (B)**.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Must account for two double bonds.**\n    To check this, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or double/triple bonds in a molecule. Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Since our molecule has one C=C and one C=O, it must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\n    The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (A):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        This formula has the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (B):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This formula only has one degree of unsaturation, which could account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, but not the additional C=C bond. It is therefore eliminated.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group and an alkene group. This corresponds to option A.\n\nA careful review of the candidate answers shows that while most of them perform the correct chemical analysis and deduce that C6H10O2 is the correct formula, many of them incorrectly select the final letter. The chemical reasoning, however, is overwhelmingly in favor of C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, along with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic diagnostic peak for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 2*16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options\n\nThe combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques consistently indicates that the unknown compound has two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH)\n2.  An **alkene** (C=C)\n\nBased on these findings, we can establish two critical requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen atom, namely C6H10O (B) and C6H12O (C). We are left with C6H12O2 (A) and C6H10O2 (D).\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The identified functional groups require:\n    *   One degree of unsaturation for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n    *   One degree of unsaturation for the C=C double bond in the alkene.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining two options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n\n*   For **C6H12O2 (A)**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient as it can only account for the C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond.\n*   For **C6H10O2 (D)**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly the molecular formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all the constraints derived from the spectroscopic data: it contains two oxygen atoms to form a carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and a careful review of the chemical data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic diagnostic peak for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Options\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count.** The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The molecule must have enough \"degrees of unsaturation\" to account for all double bonds and rings.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Calculating DoU for the Remaining Options.** We can now check the two remaining formulas, C6H12O2 and C6H10O2, using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only has one degree of unsaturation, which can account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond.\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has exactly two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all the constraints from the spectroscopic data is C6H10O2. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group. This corresponds to option D. The majority of the candidate answers reached this same conclusion through sound reasoning, even if some made clerical errors in selecting the final letter.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n*   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond).\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as (1 × 12 for C) + (2 × 16 for O) + (1 × 1 for H) = 45. This provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Functional Group Requirements:** The combined evidence points to a molecule that has both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n*   **Oxygen Atom Count:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   A C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=C double bond (from the alkene) accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n*   **Calculate DoU for the remaining options:** The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has the correct number of oxygens and the correct DoU to accommodate both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only has one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot also contain the C=C double bond identified by the FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence (presence of a carboxylic acid and an alkene) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and highly characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Synthesis and Evaluation of Chemical Formulas\n\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single conclusion: the unknown compound is a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi (double/triple) bonds in a molecule. The identified functional groups require a specific DoU:\n    *   One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C double bond (the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a **total of 2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the remaining options based on their DoU, using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This formula only has one degree of unsaturation. It can account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This formula has exactly two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence—the presence of two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation for both a carbonyl and an alkene—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the most characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules, which form dimers.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. When observed along with the very broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. The mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as (1 × 12 for Carbon) + (2 × 16 for Oxygen) + (1 × 1 for Hydrogen) = 45. This fragment provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have established two key facts about the unknown molecule:\n1.  It contains a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  It contains an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given molecular formulas based on these facts.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms**\nA carboxylic acid functional group contains two oxygen atoms. This requirement immediately eliminates any options with only one oxygen atom.\n*   B) C6H10O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n*   C) C6H12O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: **A) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n*   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match our requirement, as it only accounts for one double bond (e.g., the C=O of the acid) but not the additional C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOnly the molecular formula **C6H10O2** has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the required two degrees of unsaturation to account for both a carbonyl (C=O) and an alkene (C=C) double bond. This formula is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1.

Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of vinyl hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond) in the NMR spectrum provides definitive confirmation of the alkene functional group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n**4. Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options**\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques points to a molecule that contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these two structural requirements:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Presence of a Carboxylic Acid (-COOH)**\n    A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Presence of both C=O and C=C bonds**\n    A molecule's structure is related to its Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which represents the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement perfectly.\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (Option D):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—containing two oxygen atoms and having two degrees of unsaturation to account for both a carboxylic acid and an alkene—is **C6H10O2**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Evidence\nThe core of the problem is interpreting the provided spectroscopic data. A consistent interpretation emerges across almost all the detailed answers (e.g., Answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15).\n\n*   **FTIR (Infrared Spectroscopy):**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This indicates a carbonyl (C=O) double bond. Combined with the O-H peak, it reinforces the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the molecule is an **alkene**.\n*   **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance):**\n    *   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of these protons confirms the existence of the C=C double bond identified in the FTIR.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; total=45).\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** The unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options\nBased on the conclusion from Step 1, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must contain **two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n2.  It must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O bond in the acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on these criteria. The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated with the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Contains **2 oxygens**. (✓)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (✓)\n    *   This formula is fully consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Contains **2 oxygens**. (✓)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. (✗)\n    *   This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, meaning the molecule would be saturated (no C=C bond), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   Contains only **1 oxygen**. (✗)\n    *   This cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O:**\n    *   Contains only **1 oxygen**. (✗)\n    *   This cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\nThe chemical reasoning is unambiguous. The only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. This corresponds to option A.\n\nIt is important to note that while many of the candidate answers arrive at the correct chemical reasoning, several of them select the wrong final letter (e.g., Answer 1 selects D, Answer 2 selects B). This appears to be an error in mapping their correct conclusion (the formula C6H10O2) back to the original options. The analysis itself, however, is overwhelmingly in favor of C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, along with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### **4. Integration of Data and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points conclusively to a molecule that contains:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  An **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given molecular formulas based on these required features.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Presence of a Carboxylic Acid**\n    A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), as they only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The \"Degree of Unsaturation\" (DoU) represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining two options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This formula has the required two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option D):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This formula only has one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot also contain the C=C double bond identified by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and, combined with the broad O-H peak, further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass ≈ 12 for C + 32 for two O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### Synthesis and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas\n\n1.  **Functional Group Requirements:** The combined data unequivocally indicates the presence of two key functional groups: a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** and an **alkene (C=C)**.\n\n2.  **Oxygen Atom Count:** A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options with only one oxygen:\n    *   B) C6H12O\n    *   C) C6H10O\n\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. We can use it to distinguish between the remaining options.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n4.  **Calculating DoU for the remaining options:** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all the evidence from the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry is **C6H10O2**. It contains the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and has the two degrees of unsaturation needed to account for both the carbonyl group and the alkene group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and, when paired with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.

A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**, which means the formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  A **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\nThese two features also dictate the required **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   One C=O double bond (from the acid) = 1 DoU\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n*   **Total required DoU = 2**\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Contains **two oxygen atoms** (consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This formula matches all requirements.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU is insufficient to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   Contains only **one oxygen atom**, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Contains only **one oxygen atom**, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to accommodate both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the most characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an **alkene**.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.

This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n*   **Constraint 2 (Degrees of Unsaturation):** The molecule contains one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation (DoU). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the remaining options against the DoU constraint using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Contains two oxygen atoms (satisfies Constraint 1).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This satisfies Constraint 2.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Contains two oxygen atoms (satisfies Constraint 1).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not satisfy Constraint 2, as it only accounts for one double bond (the C=O), not the additional C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in systematically interpreting each piece of spectroscopic evidence and using it to build a set of constraints that the correct molecular formula must satisfy.\n\n**1. FTIR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence alongside the broad O-H peak is strong confirmation of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The combination of these three peaks strongly suggests the molecule is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n**2. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This observation provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the **alkene (C=C) functional group** suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Mass Spectrometry Analysis**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This mass-to-charge ratio corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺.

This functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This constraint immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen.\n    *   A) C6H12O (1 oxygen) -> Eliminated\n    *   C) C6H10O (1 oxygen) -> Eliminated\n    *   We are left with **B) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining candidates using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n        *   For **B) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   For **D) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is insufficient, as it can only account for the C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all the constraints derived from the experimental data: it contains two oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid) and has two degrees of unsaturation (for the C=O and C=C bonds).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the task is to interpret a set of spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1H NMR, Mass Spectrometry) to identify the correct molecular formula for an unknown compound from a list of four options.\n\n1.  **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is a hallmark of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

This provides a third, independent piece of evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Synthesis and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas\n\nBased on the combined data, the unknown compound must have two key features:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**, which means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nThis allows us to evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) C6H10O: Has only one oxygen. Incorrect.\n*   B) C6H12O: Has only one oxygen. Incorrect.\n*   C) C6H12O2: Has two oxygens, but we must check its **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**.\n*   D) C6H10O2: Has two oxygens, so it remains a possibility.\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The identified functional groups require a specific DoU:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n*   **Total required DoU = 2**\n\nNow, we calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n\n*   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C bond. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that contains the necessary two oxygen atoms and has the required two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2. A vast majority of the candidate answers reached this same conclusion in their reasoning, even if some had errors in their final letter choice.

This perfectly matches the two degrees of unsaturation required by the evidence.\n\n4.  **Final Choice:**\n    *   After applying all constraints, only one candidate survives: **C6H10O2**.\n    *   This corresponds to option D in the original question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe first step is to interpret what each piece of spectroscopic data tells us about the unknown compound's functional groups.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it reinforces the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This directly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total=45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Findings and Establish Requirements\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown molecule must have the following features:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means it must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C), which is a double bond.\n3.  The carboxylic acid's carbonyl group (C=O) is also a double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the four options against the requirements established in Step 2.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Must have two oxygen atoms.**\n    *   C6H12O (D) and C6H10O (C) only have one oxygen atom. They are eliminated.\n    *   The remaining candidates are **C6H10O2 (A)** and **C6H12O2 (B)**.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Must account for two double bonds.**\n    To check this, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or double/triple bonds in a molecule. Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Since our molecule has one C=C and one C=O, it must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\n    The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (A):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        This formula has the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (B):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This formula only has one degree of unsaturation, which could account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, but not the additional C=C bond. It is therefore eliminated.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group and an alkene group. This corresponds to option A.\n\nA careful review of the candidate answers shows that while most of them perform the correct chemical analysis and deduce that C6H10O2 is the correct formula, many of them incorrectly select the final letter. The chemical reasoning, however, is overwhelmingly in favor of C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, along with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic diagnostic peak for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 2*16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options\n\nThe combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques consistently indicates that the unknown compound has two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH)\n2.  An **alkene** (C=C)\n\nBased on these findings, we can establish two critical requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen atom, namely C6H10O (B) and C6H12O (C). We are left with C6H12O2 (A) and C6H10O2 (D).\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The identified functional groups require:\n    *   One degree of unsaturation for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n    *   One degree of unsaturation for the C=C double bond in the alkene.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining two options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n\n*   For **C6H12O2 (A)**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient as it can only account for the C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond.\n*   For **C6H10O2 (D)**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly the molecular formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all the constraints derived from the spectroscopic data: it contains two oxygen atoms to form a carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and a careful review of the chemical data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic diagnostic peak for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Options\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count.** The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The molecule must have enough \"degrees of unsaturation\" to account for all double bonds and rings.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Calculating DoU for the Remaining Options.** We can now check the two remaining formulas, C6H12O2 and C6H10O2, using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only has one degree of unsaturation, which can account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond.\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has exactly two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all the constraints from the spectroscopic data is C6H10O2. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group. This corresponds to option D. The majority of the candidate answers reached this same conclusion through sound reasoning, even if some made clerical errors in selecting the final letter.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1.

The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi (double/triple) bonds in a molecule. The identified functional groups require a specific DoU:\n    *   One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C double bond (the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a **total of 2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the remaining options based on their DoU, using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This formula only has one degree of unsaturation.

The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules, which form dimers.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. When observed along with the very broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. The mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as (1 × 12 for Carbon) + (2 × 16 for Oxygen) + (1 × 1 for Hydrogen) = 45. This fragment provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have established two key facts about the unknown molecule:\n1.  It contains a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  It contains an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given molecular formulas based on these facts.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms**\nA carboxylic acid functional group contains two oxygen atoms. This requirement immediately eliminates any options with only one oxygen atom.\n*   B) C6H10O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n*   C) C6H12O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: **A) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n*   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.

Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options**\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques points to a molecule that contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these two structural requirements:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Presence of a Carboxylic Acid (-COOH)**\n    A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Presence of both C=O and C=C bonds**\n    A molecule's structure is related to its Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which represents the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement perfectly.\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (Option D):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—containing two oxygen atoms and having two degrees of unsaturation to account for both a carboxylic acid and an alkene—is **C6H10O2**.

A consistent interpretation emerges across almost all the detailed answers (e.g., Answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15).\n\n*   **FTIR (Infrared Spectroscopy):**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This indicates a carbonyl (C=O) double bond. Combined with the O-H peak, it reinforces the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the molecule is an **alkene**.\n*   **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance):**\n    *   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The presence of these protons confirms the existence of the C=C double bond identified in the FTIR.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; total=45).\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** The unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options\nBased on the conclusion from Step 1, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must contain **two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n2.  It must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O bond in the acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on these criteria. The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated with the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Contains **2 oxygens**. (✓)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.

(✗)\n    *   This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, meaning the molecule would be saturated (no C=C bond), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   Contains only **1 oxygen**.

(✗)\n    *   This cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\nThe chemical reasoning is unambiguous. The only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. This corresponds to option A.\n\nIt is important to note that while many of the candidate answers arrive at the correct chemical reasoning, several of them select the wrong final letter (e.g., Answer 1 selects D, Answer 2 selects B). This appears to be an error in mapping their correct conclusion (the formula C6H10O2) back to the original options. The analysis itself, however, is overwhelmingly in favor of C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, along with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum provides direct confirmation of the alkene functional group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### **4. Integration of Data and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points conclusively to a molecule that contains:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  An **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given molecular formulas based on these required features.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Presence of a Carboxylic Acid**\n    A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), as they only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The \"Degree of Unsaturation\" (DoU) represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining two options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This formula has the required two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option D):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This formula only has one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot also contain the C=C double bond identified by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and, combined with the broad O-H peak, further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass ≈ 12 for C + 32 for two O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### Synthesis and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas\n\n1.  **Functional Group Requirements:** The combined data unequivocally indicates the presence of two key functional groups: a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** and an **alkene (C=C)**.\n\n2.  **Oxygen Atom Count:** A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options with only one oxygen:\n    *   B) C6H12O\n    *   C) C6H10O\n\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. We can use it to distinguish between the remaining options.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n4.  **Calculating DoU for the remaining options:** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all the evidence from the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry is **C6H10O2**. It contains the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and has the two degrees of unsaturation needed to account for both the carbonyl group and the alkene group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region and, when paired with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.

A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**, which means the formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  A **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\nThese two features also dictate the required **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   One C=O double bond (from the acid) = 1 DoU\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n*   **Total required DoU = 2**\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Contains **two oxygen atoms** (consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This formula matches all requirements.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU is insufficient to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   Contains only **one oxygen atom**, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Contains only **one oxygen atom**, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to accommodate both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the most characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an **alkene**.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.

This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n*   **Constraint 2 (Degrees of Unsaturation):** The molecule contains one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation (DoU). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the remaining options against the DoU constraint using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Contains two oxygen atoms (satisfies Constraint 1).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This satisfies Constraint 2.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Contains two oxygen atoms (satisfies Constraint 1).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not satisfy Constraint 2, as it only accounts for one double bond (the C=O), not the additional C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both a carbonyl group and an alkene group. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in systematically interpreting each piece of spectroscopic evidence and using it to build a set of constraints that the correct molecular formula must satisfy.\n\n**1. FTIR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence alongside the broad O-H peak is strong confirmation of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The combination of these three peaks strongly suggests the molecule is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n**2. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This observation provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the **alkene (C=C) functional group** suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Mass Spectrometry Analysis**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This mass-to-charge ratio corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n*   **Careful Point 3:** This is a diagnostic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids and provides a third, independent piece of evidence for the **-COOH functional group**.\n\n### Evaluating the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we use the conclusions from the spectral analysis to test the given molecular formulas.\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Oxygen Count**\n    The evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) is overwhelming. This functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This constraint immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen.\n    *   A) C6H12O (1 oxygen) -> Eliminated\n    *   C) C6H10O (1 oxygen) -> Eliminated\n    *   We are left with **B) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining candidates using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n        *   For **B) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   For **D) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is insufficient, as it can only account for the C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all the constraints derived from the experimental data: it contains two oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid) and has two degrees of unsaturation (for the C=O and C=C bonds).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the task is to interpret a set of spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1H NMR, Mass Spectrometry) to identify the correct molecular formula for an unknown compound from a list of four options.\n\n1.  **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is a hallmark of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides a third, independent piece of evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Synthesis and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas\n\nBased on the combined data, the unknown compound must have two key features:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**, which means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nThis allows us to evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) C6H10O: Has only one oxygen. Incorrect.\n*   B) C6H12O: Has only one oxygen. Incorrect.\n*   C) C6H12O2: Has two oxygens, but we must check its **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**.\n*   D) C6H10O2: Has two oxygens, so it remains a possibility.\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The identified functional groups require a specific DoU:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n*   **Total required DoU = 2**\n\nNow, we calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n\n*   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, but not the additional C=C bond. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that contains the necessary two oxygen atoms and has the required two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2. A vast majority of the candidate answers reached this same conclusion in their reasoning, even if some had errors in their final letter choice. The correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
