    Checks the correctness of the chosen synthetic pathway for converting
    ethynylcyclohexane to 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

    The overall strategy is:
    1. Alkylation of the terminal alkyne.
    2. Partial reduction of the internal alkyne to an alkene.
    3. Reductive ozonolysis of the alkene to form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    4. Base-catalyzed self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
