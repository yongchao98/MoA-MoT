    # --- Step 1: Verify the structure of Product 1 ---
    # Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH, 240C -> Product 1
    # Data: IR at 1720 cm-1 (ketone), 14 protons (C10H14O formula).
    # Chemical principle: Harsh basic conditions on dihaloadamantanes cause skeletal rearrangement.
    # Conclusion: The most plausible structure for Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one.

    # --- Step 2: Verify the structure of Product 2 ---
    # Reaction: Product 1 + Al(OiPr)3, heat -> Product 2
    # Chemical principle: The next step is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. The reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction (ketone -> alcohol) followed by heat-induced dehydration (alcohol -> alkene).

    # --- Step 3: Verify the structure of Product 3 ---
    # Reaction: Product 2 + O3, then DMS -> Product 3
    # Chemical principle: Reductive ozonolysis of an alkene. The double bond in protoadamantene is a -CH=CH- unit (disubstituted). Cleavage of this unit yields two aldehyde groups.

    # Neighbors: An axial proton is coupled to 4 neighbors on the adjacent CH2 groups: 2 equivalent axial protons and 2 equivalent equatorial protons.
