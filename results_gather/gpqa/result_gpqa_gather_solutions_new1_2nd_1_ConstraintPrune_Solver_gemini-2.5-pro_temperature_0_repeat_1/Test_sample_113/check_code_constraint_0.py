Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.

**1. Analyze Reaction 1 to Determine Reagent A**

*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`
*   **Reaction Type:** This is a **cyanohydrin formation**. A ketone (butan-2-one) is converted into a cyanohydrin, which has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitrile (-CN) group on the same carbon atom.
*   **Mechanism:** The reaction involves two key steps. First, the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This forms a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate. Second, this intermediate must be protonated to form the final, stable hydroxyl group.
*   **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction.
    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution and is the standard reagent used to provide protons for this step.
    *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is used in a different type of carbonyl addition reaction and is not the correct reagent for cyanohydrin formation.
*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options A and B.

**2. Analyze Reaction 2 to Determine Reagent B**

*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`
*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a **nitrile hydrolysis**.
*   **Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires vigorous conditions, typically heating with water and a strong catalyst, which can be either a strong acid or a strong base.
*   **Identifying Reagent B:** Reagent B is the catalyst for this hydrolysis. We must choose between the remaining options, `HCl` and `CH₃COOH`.
    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a **strong acid** and is a standard, effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles.
    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a **weak acid**. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this reaction to completion under typical laboratory conditions.
*   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B must be HCl**. This eliminates option D.

**3. Final Conclusion**

*   The analysis of Reaction 1 shows that **A = H₃O⁺**.
*   The analysis of Reaction 2 shows that **B = HCl**.
*   The only option that matches both of these requirements is C.

**Careful Points to Consider:**

*   **Reaction 1:** It is crucial to recognize this as cyanohydrin formation and understand that the final step is the protonation of an alkoxide intermediate, for which an acid source (`H₃O⁺`) is required.
*   **Reaction 2:** It is crucial to recognize this as nitrile hydrolysis and understand that it requires a strong catalyst. Differentiating between the catalytic ability of a strong acid (`HCl`) and a weak acid (`CH₃COOH`) is key to selecting the correct reagent.
*   **Mapping:** A significant number of the provided candidate answers reached the correct chemical conclusion (A=H₃O⁺, B=HCl) but failed to map it to the correct lettered option from the original prompt. It is essential to carefully check the final conclusion against the provided list of options.

Based on the chemical principles, the correct combination is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option C.
