    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the task based on the provided candidate answers.

    ### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Physics Concept

    The question asks for the set of assumptions that jointly define the "impulse approximation." The central idea of this approximation is to simplify a complex interaction between a probe (e.g., an electron) and a nucleus. It treats this many-body problem as a sum of simple, one-body interactions. The name "impulse" implies a very rapid, high-energy collision, suggesting that the struck nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle for the brief moment of interaction.

    ### Step 2: Analyze Each Assumption

    A careful analysis of the physical meaning of each assumption, which is reflected in the reasoning of nearly all the candidate answers, leads to the following conclusions:

    *   **Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational principle. It allows the problem to be broken down from a complex many-body interaction into a sum of one-body interactions. It explicitly ignores effects where the probe interacts with multiple nucleons at once. **This assumption is essential.**

    *   **Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption deals with the environment of the collision. For the struck nucleon to behave as if it were "free," it and the probe must not be interfered with by the other nucleons. This means ignoring initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI). This is a key part of the simplified picture. **This assumption is essential.**

    *   **Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, which is a different physical scale. The impulse approximation treats nucleons as the fundamental particles of the interaction. The internal dynamics of the nucleon's constituent quarks are a separate physical model and not a defining feature of the impulse approximation. In fact, for the high-energy interactions where this approximation is most valid, the quarks are highly relativistic. **This assumption is not part of the impulse approximation and serves as a distractor.**

    *   **Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the essence of the "impulse" in the approximation's name. It assumes the interaction is so sudden and energetic that the relatively weak nuclear binding forces are negligible *during* the brief moment of the collision. This allows the calculation to use the kinematics of a free particle for the interaction itself. **This assumption is essential.**

    ### Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Identify Careful Points

    1.  **Correct Combination:** The physical analysis consistently shows that the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**.

    2.  **Consensus in Reasoning:** A review of all 15 candidate answers reveals an overwhelming consensus in their step-by-step reasoning. Almost every answer correctly identifies that assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are necessary, and that assumption 3 is an irrelevant distractor.

    3.  **Common Error Source:** The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the physics analysis but in a simple clerical step: mapping the correct set of numbers {1, 2, 4} to the corresponding multiple-choice letter.
        *   A) 1, 2, 3
        *   B) 2, 3, 4
        *   C) 1, 3, 4
        *   **D) 1, 2, 4**

    4.  **Final Verification:** The set {1, 2, 4} correctly corresponds to option **D**. The candidate answers that are internally consistent (where the final letter matches the conclusion of the reasoning) all arrive at D (e.g., answers 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15). The answers that conclude with A, B, or C do so despite their own reasoning pointing to the set {1, 2, 4}.

    ### Conclusion

    Based on a thorough analysis of the underlying physics and a meta-analysis of the provided candidate answers, the correct set of assumptions is {1, 2, 4}. This corresponds to option D.
