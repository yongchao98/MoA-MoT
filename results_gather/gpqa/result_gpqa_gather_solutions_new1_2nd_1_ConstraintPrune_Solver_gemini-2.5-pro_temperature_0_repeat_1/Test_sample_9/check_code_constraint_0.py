    # --- Step 1: Verify the Physical Reasoning ---
    # The core principle is gravitational compression: for planets of the same composition,
    # higher mass leads to stronger gravity, which compresses the material and increases density.

    # We can represent the densities qualitatively. Let's use Earth's density as a baseline.
    # Earth's average density is ~5.51 g/cm^3.
    density_earth = 5.51

    # Planet a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. This is the baseline.
    density_a = density_earth

    # Planet b: 2 Earth masses, density explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm^3.
    density_b = 5.50

    # Planet d: Same composition as Earth, half the mass. Less mass -> less compression -> lower density.
    # For a rough estimate, R ∝ M^0.28 for rocky planets.
    # V ∝ R^3 ∝ (M^0.28)^3 = M^0.84. Density ρ = M/V ∝ M / M^0.84 = M^0.16.
    # So, density_d ≈ density_earth * (0.5)^0.16 ≈ 5.51 * 0.89 ≈ 4.9 g/cm^3.
    # The key is that density_d < density_earth.
    density_d = density_earth * math.pow(0.5, 0.16)

    # Planet c: Same composition as Earth, 5 times the mass. More mass -> more compression -> higher density.
    # Using the same relation: density_c ≈ density_earth * (5)^0.16 ≈ 5.51 * 1.29 ≈ 7.1 g/cm^3.
    # The key is that density_c > density_earth.
    density_c = density_earth * math.pow(5, 0.16)

    densities = {
        'a': density_a,
        'b': density_b,
        'c': density_c,
        'd': density_d
    }

    # Determine which planet description corresponds to the highest density.
    correct_description = max(densities, key=densities.get)

    if correct_description != 'c':
        return (f"Incorrect: The physical reasoning is flawed. The code determined that planet '{correct_description}' "
                f"is the densest, not 'c'. The principle of gravitational compression dictates that the 5-Earth-mass "
                f"planet ('c') should be the densest. Calculated densities: {densities}")

    # --- Step 2: Verify the Mapping and Final Choice ---
    # The provided final answer acknowledges the mapping is ambiguous and resolves it by
    # siding with the plurality of candidate answers that explicitly stated their mapping.
    # The final answer's reasoning is:
    # 1. Planet 'c' is the densest. (Verified above).
    # 2. The most plausible mapping based on candidate analysis is A=c.
    # 3. Therefore, the final choice is 'A'.

    final_choice_to_check = 'A'
    
    # The mapping assumed by the final answer to justify its choice.
    assumed_mapping = {'A': 'c'}

    # Check if the final choice is consistent with the correct description under the assumed mapping.
    if assumed_mapping.get(final_choice_to_check) == correct_description:
        return "Correct"
    else:
        return (f"Incorrect: There is a logical inconsistency in the final answer. "
                f"It correctly identifies planet '{correct_description}' as the densest. "
                f"However, it chose '{final_choice_to_check}' as the final answer, which does not correspond to "
