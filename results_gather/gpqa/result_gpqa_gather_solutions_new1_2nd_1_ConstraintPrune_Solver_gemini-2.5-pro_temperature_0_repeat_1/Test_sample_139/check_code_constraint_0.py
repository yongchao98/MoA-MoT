Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the chemical puzzle, the following conclusion is reached.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1.  **Consensus on Chemical Identities**: All detailed candidate answers correctly deduce the identities of the key substances through a logical application of constraints.
    *   **Substance B**: The melting point of ~277 K (3.85 °C) is a near-perfect match for heavy water, **D₂O** (melting point 3.82 °C). This is the foundational clue that introduces the deuterium isotope.
    *   **Gas W**: A molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons, in a reaction involving deuterium, is unambiguously **D₂** gas (2 protons, 2 neutrons).
    *   **Substance X**: The clues converge on **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.
        *   It contains the heavy isotope Deuterium (D).
        *   Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.
        *   It reacts violently with heavy water (Y = D₂O) to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃).
        *   The precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) decomposes upon heating to release B (D₂O).
        *   As a strong reducing agent, it reduces a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to a diol (containing 2 oxygen atoms), satisfying the final constraint.

2.  **Verification of the Calculation**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).
    *   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄
    *   **Elements by Atomic Number**: Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), Aluminum (Z=13).
    *   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen.
    *   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminum.
    *   **Calculation Rule**: Sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We use integer mass numbers for the relevant isotopes.
        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of D is 2.
            *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.
        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.
            *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.
        *   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.

3.  **Final Decision and Evaluation of Candidates**:
    *   The chemical analysis and the subsequent calculation consistently and correctly yield the numerical answer **35**.
    *   The options provided in the original question are: A) 31, B) 25, C) 35, D) 29.
    *   The calculated value of 35 directly corresponds to option **C**.
    *   A review of the candidate answers reveals that while the underlying logic and calculation are almost universally correct, many answers contain a clerical error, incorrectly matching the number 35 to the wrong letter option (e.g., A, B, or D). This appears to be due to scrambled option lists in their respective generation processes. However, the core deduction that the answer is 35 is the overwhelming consensus.
