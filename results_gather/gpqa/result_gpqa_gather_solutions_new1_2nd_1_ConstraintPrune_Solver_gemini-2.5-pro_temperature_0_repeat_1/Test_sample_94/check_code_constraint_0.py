This task requires a detailed, step-by-step analysis of a two-step organic synthesis problem to determine which of the provided options is a valid product.

### **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**

**Step 1: Epoxidation of the Starting Material**

1.  **Starting Material:** The reactant is `3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one`.
    *   **Structure:** `CH₂(1)=CH(2)—C(3)(CH₃)₂—C(4)(=O)—CH(5)=C(6)(CH₃)—CH₃(7)`
    *   This molecule has two distinct double bonds:
        *   A monosubstituted, **isolated** double bond at C1=C2.
        *   A trisubstituted, **conjugated** double bond at C5=C6 (part of an α,β-unsaturated ketone system).

2.  **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with 1 equivalent of m-CPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid), a reagent for epoxidation.
    *   **Reactivity:** The reactivity of a double bond towards m-CPBA is increased by electron-donating alkyl groups (favoring the more substituted C5=C6 bond) but decreased by conjugation to an electron-withdrawing ketone (disfavoring the C5=C6 bond).
    *   **Key Constraint:** The problem explicitly states, "**Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.**" This is a critical instruction. It means we must not assume one pathway is dominant; instead, we must consider that epoxidation occurs at both sites, producing a mixture of two intermediates.
        *   **Intermediate A (from C1=C2 epoxidation):** `1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhepta-5-en-4-one`.
        *   **Intermediate B (from C5=C6 epoxidation):** `5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-1-en-4-one`.

**Step 2: Reaction with Gilman Reagent**

1.  **Reagent:** The mixture of intermediates is treated with an **excess** of a Gilman reagent, lithium dimethylcuprate ((CH₃)₂CuLi), formed from methyllithium and copper(I) iodide.
2.  **Reactivity of Gilman Reagent:** Gilman reagents are soft nucleophiles known for:
    *   Performing 1,4-conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones.
    *   Opening epoxide rings, typically at the less sterically hindered carbon.
    *   **Crucially, they do not reduce ketones to alcohols.**

### **Evaluating the Options**

First, we can prune the options based on the fundamental reactivity of the Gilman reagent.

*   **Constraint 1: The ketone is not reduced.** The final product must retain the ketone functional group. Options A and D are diols (containing two alcohol groups and no ketone), which would require the reduction of the C4 ketone. This is not a reaction that Gilman reagents perform.
    *   A) 2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol -> **Eliminated**.
    *   B) 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one -> Plausible (keto-alcohol).
    *   C) 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one -> Plausible (keto-alcohol).
    *   D) 4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol -> **Eliminated**.

The correct answer must be either B or C. Now we must trace the reaction pathways from our two intermediates to see if they lead to these products.

**Pathway from Intermediate A (leading to Option C)**

1.  **Substrate:** `1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhepta-5-en-4-one`. This molecule has two sites that react with a Gilman reagent: the α,β-unsaturated ketone and the epoxide.
2.  **Key Constraint:** The reagent is in **excess**, meaning it will react with both sites.
3.  **Reactions:**
    *   **1,4-Conjugate Addition:** A methyl group adds to the β-carbon (C6) of the unsaturated ketone system.
    *   **Epoxide Opening:** A second methyl group attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide (the primary carbon, C1), opening the ring to form an alcohol at C2.
4.  **Final Product Structure:** `CH₃—CH₂—CH(OH)—C(CH₃)₂—C(=O)—CH₂—C(CH₃)₂—CH₃`
5.  **IUPAC Name:** The longest carbon chain containing the ketone is an 8-carbon chain (octane). Numbering from the right gives the ketone the C4 position. The substituents are a hydroxyl at C6 and four methyl groups at C2, C2, C5, and C5. The name is **6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one**.
6.  **Conclusion:** This name perfectly matches **Option C**. This pathway is a direct and complete consequence of the stated reaction conditions.

**Pathway from Intermediate B (leading to Option B)**

1.  **Substrate:** `5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-1-en-4-one`. This is an α,β-epoxy ketone.
2.  **Reaction:** Gilman reagents open α,β-epoxy ketones via a 1,4-conjugate style attack at the β-carbon (C6). The methyl group adds to C6, and the epoxide opens to form an alcohol at C5. The isolated double bond at C1=C2 does not react.
3.  **Final Product Structure:** `CH₂=CH—C(CH₃)₂—C(=O)—CH(OH)—C(CH₃)₂—CH₃`
4.  **IUPAC Name:** The parent chain is a 7-carbon chain containing a double bond and a ketone (`hept-1-en-4-one`). The substituents are a hydroxyl at C5 and four methyl groups at C3, C3, C6, and C6. The name is **5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one**.
5.  **Conclusion:** This name perfectly matches **Option B**.

### **Final Decision**

The problem states that a 1:1 mixture of intermediates is formed, and this mixture is treated with an excess of Gilman reagent. Our analysis shows that this will produce a final mixture containing both the product in Option B and the product in Option C. Since the question asks to name *one* product that will be formed, both B and C are chemically correct answers derived from the problem statement.

However, in a multiple-choice question, we must select the best possible answer. The pathway leading to **Option C** is a more complete illustration of the reaction conditions. The "excess" reagent condition is essential for the two sequential additions to occur on Intermediate A, making the formation of C a robust and comprehensive outcome that utilizes all the information provided.

*   **Constraint Check:**
    *   Starting material and reagents are correctly identified. **Pass**
    *   The "1:1 mixture" clue correctly leads to two intermediates (A and B). **Pass**
    *   The "Gilman does not reduce ketones" constraint correctly eliminates options A and D. **Pass**
    *   The "excess reagent" clue is fully utilized in the pathway from Intermediate A to Product C, which involves two additions. **Pass**
    *   Both pathways from A and B lead to valid options (C and B, respectively). **Pass**
    *   The pathway to C is a more complete chemical consequence of the stated conditions. **Final Decision**
