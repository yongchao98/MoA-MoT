Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, taking into account the provided candidate answers.

### Step 1: Analyze the Thermodynamic Aspect

The first part of the statement is: "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions."

1.  **Core Principle:** The thermodynamic strength of an oxidizing agent is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.
2.  **Analysis:** We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in a basic solution to its potential in an acidic solution. There is a complete consensus among all candidate answers on the relevant data:
    *   **In acidic solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l), with **E° = +1.23 V**
    *   **In basic solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq), with **E° = +0.40 V**
3.  **Conclusion:** Since the reduction potential in basic solution (+0.40 V) is significantly lower than in acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This part of the analysis is undisputed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Kinetic Aspect

The second part of the statement is: "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions."

1.  **Core Principle:** Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction, which is governed by its activation energy. A high activation energy results in a slow reaction rate.
2.  **Analysis:** The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is a famously complex and slow process. It requires breaking a very strong O=O double bond and involves multiple electron transfer steps. This results in a high activation energy, a phenomenon known in electrochemistry as "sluggish kinetics" or a high "overpotential." Furthermore, as noted by many of the candidate answers, the reaction is generally even more sluggish (slower) in acidic media than in alkaline (basic) media.
3.  **Conclusion:** Whether interpreted as an inherent characteristic or in direct comparison to basic media, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions. This conclusion is also universally agreed upon in the reasoning of the candidate answers.

### Step 3: Combine the Findings and Select the Final Answer

*   From the thermodynamic analysis, the first word is **weaker**.
*   From the kinetic analysis, the second word is **slower**.

The correct combination is **weaker - slower**.

Now, we match this combination to the options provided in the original question prompt:
A) weaker - slower
B) stronger – slower
C) stronger – faster
D) weaker – faster

The combination "weaker - slower" corresponds directly to option A.

### Careful Points to Note

1.  **Thermodynamics vs. Kinetics:** This question is a classic test of the crucial distinction between thermodynamic favorability (what *can* happen, measured by E°) and kinetic rate (how *fast* it happens, related to activation energy). Oxygen is a textbook example of a substance that is a strong oxidant thermodynamically but a slow reactant kinetically.
2.  **Basis of Comparison:** The terms "weaker" and "slower" are comparative. "Weaker" compares the oxidizing strength in basic solution to that in acidic solution. "Slower" describes the reaction rate in acidic solution, which is slow both in absolute terms (due to high activation energy) and relative to its rate in basic solution.
3.  **Critical Error in Candidate Answers:** The most significant finding from analyzing the candidate answers is not a disagreement on the science, but a widespread failure in mapping their correct conclusion to the multiple-choice options. Nearly every candidate correctly reasoned that the answer is "weaker - slower," but they arrived at different final letters (A, B, C, and D) because they were apparently working from different, inconsistent lists of options. This reinforces the confidence in the scientific conclusion ("weaker - slower") while highlighting the unreliability of their final letter choices. The correct approach is to trust the consistent scientific reasoning and map it to the canonical options provided in the problem description.
