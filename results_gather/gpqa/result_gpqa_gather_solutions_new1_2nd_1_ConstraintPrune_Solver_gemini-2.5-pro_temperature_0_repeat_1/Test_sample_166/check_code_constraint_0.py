def check_non_gaussianity_calculation():
    """
    Checks the calculation of non-Gaussianity (nG) for a Schrödinger cat state.

    The problem asks for the nG of the state:
    |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N
    with parameters alpha = 0.5 and phi = -pi/4.

    The non-Gaussianity measure is the relative entropy:
    del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)
    where S is the von Neumann entropy.

    For a pure state like |psi>, its entropy S(rho) is 0.
    So, nG = S(tau).

    The reference Gaussian state tau has the same first and second moments as rho.
    For the given parameters (an "odd cat state"):
    - First moment <a> = 0.
    - Second moments:
        - m = <a^2> = alpha^2
        - n = <n> = <a†a> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)

    The entropy of the reference Gaussian state S(tau) is calculated from its
    symplectic eigenvalue nu:
    - nu^2 = (n + 1/2)^2 - |m|^2
    - S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)

    This function re-performs the calculation and compares it to the provided answer.
