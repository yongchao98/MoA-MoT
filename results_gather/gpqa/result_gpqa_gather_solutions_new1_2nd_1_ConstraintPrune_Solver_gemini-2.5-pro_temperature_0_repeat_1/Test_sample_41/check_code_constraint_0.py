    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the exoplanet problem.
    
    It verifies the calculation based on the physical principles of equilibrium temperature
    and Kepler's Third Law.
    
    The key relationships are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) vs. Orbital Distance (a): T_eq ∝ 1/√a
    2. Kepler's Third Law: Period (P) vs. Orbital Distance (a): P² ∝ a³
    
    From these, a direct relationship can be derived: P ∝ T_eq⁻³
