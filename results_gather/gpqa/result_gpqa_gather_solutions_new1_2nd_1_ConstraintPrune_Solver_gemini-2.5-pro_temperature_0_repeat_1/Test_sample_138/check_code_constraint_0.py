    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer for the given chemistry question.

    The question asks to identify the starting materials A and B for two separate reactions
    that produce specific diketones. The reaction conditions (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) indicate
    an alpha-oxidation of a ketone.

    Constraints:
    1. The reaction is an alpha-oxidation, which converts a ketone into a 1,2-diketone.
       Therefore, both starting materials A and B must be ketones.
    2. Reaction A: A -> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. The starting material must be
       4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one.
    3. Reaction B: B -> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. The starting material must be
       5-methylhexan-2-one.
