All sound analyses converge on the same logical pathway.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\nThe most logical approach is to work backward from the most defined substance, Z, to the unknown mixture, X.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe identity of Z is the foundation for solving the entire problem. It can be deduced from three key pieces of information.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Decoding the Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction.**\n    Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y` → `6y = 12x` → `y = 2x`.\n    *   This shows that the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Importance of Saturation.**\n    A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which is the definitive clue that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Common Carbon Skeleton and Identity.**\n    The fact that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z is a critical clue. It implies that all precursor compounds share the same carbon skeleton. Given that Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the reaction context involves a disproportionation likely forming an aromatic ring, a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton. The C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which fits all the given criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Since the hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   For this second component to not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\nThis step connects the starting material (X) to the product (Y) to find the answer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms.**\n    The most direct and elegant way to solve the problem is by using the law of conservation of atoms. An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. The overall reaction for one molecule of each component is:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    The law dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Verification of Chemical Plausibility**\nTo ensure the entire scenario is consistent, we can check if a plausible mixture X could exist.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: The \"No Conjugated Multiple Bonds\" Constraint.**\n    The components of mixture X must be C₆ unsaturated ring compounds that decolorize bromine water, but they cannot have conjugated double bonds. Their total hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n*   A plausible composition for Mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen Sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-Conjugated Bonds:** Crucially, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the constraint. This explicitly rules out its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which is conjugated.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer (disproportionation), confirming the scenario is chemically sound.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the original problem statement, a clear and consistent logical path emerges. All sound reasoning converges on the same numerical result by following these steps.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of substance Z is determined by systematically combining the given clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction.** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7. For any hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. By setting this equal to 1/7, we solve the equation: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and ultimately `y = 2x`. This shows that Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Clue 2: Saturation.** The problem states that Z is a final hydrogenation product that \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a fully saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Clue 3: Structure and Identity.** We are told that all compounds in the reaction scheme are converted to *only* Z upon hydrogenation, which implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. The nature of the disproportionation reaction (which involves dehydrogenation) strongly suggests a six-membered ring system, which allows for the formation of a stable aromatic ring. Combined with the clue that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. It is a common solvent, a C₆ cycloalkane, and fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, the composition of mixture Y can be determined.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Properties of Mixture Y.** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We are told Z (**cyclohexane**) is one component. The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like cyclohexane) or aromatic.\n*   **Clue 2: Hydrogenation Product.** The hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. Since one component is already cyclohexane, the other component must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. This confirms it has a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   **Deduction:** We are looking for a C₆ ring compound that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water. A cycloalkene is ruled out. The only substance that fits these criteria is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation via the Law of Conservation of Atoms**\nThis is the most direct method to answer the question.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y. We can write the overall transformation for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Law:** The Law of Conservation of Atoms states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" Based on the conservation principle, this total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one C₆H₁₂ molecule) + (H atoms in one C₆H₆ molecule)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Mass:** The most critical logical step is applying the law of conservation of mass. This allows the problem to be solved without definitively identifying the components of mixture X.\n2.  **The \"No Conjugated Bonds\" Rule:** To ensure the scenario is chemically plausible, we must check that a mixture X fitting all descriptions can exist. A key constraint is that it has no *conjugated* multiple bonds. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly.\n    *   The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Crucially, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated, satisfying the specific rule. The conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is thus excluded.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n3.  **Final Answer Consistency:** The robust reasoning from all steps consistently leads to the conclusion that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This matches option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided answers and the original problem statement, the solution can be derived through a clear, multi-step process. All sound analyses converge on the same logic and numerical answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of substance Z is deduced from three key pieces of information:\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 and solving gives `12x = 6y`, which simplifies to the relationship `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene with the same formula is unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n*   **Specific Identity:** We are told that Z is the *sole* product of hydrogenating all other compounds, which implies they all share its carbon skeleton. The nature of the reaction (disproportionation) and Z's use as a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly suggest a six-membered ring system. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is a widely used solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity perfectly fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y:\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We are also told Z is a constituent of Y.\n*   **Known Component:** One component is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Unknown Component:** The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (since Z is the only final product). For this component to not decolorize bromine water but be hydrogenated, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical identity for a C₆-ring compound that fits these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the reaction that connects mixture X and mixture Y.\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this organic chemistry context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall stoichiometry for the equimolar mixtures is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Governing Principle:** A fundamental principle of chemistry is the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**, which states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n*   **The Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". Based on the conservation principle, this must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Verification**\nA thorough analysis includes checking for consistency with all given constraints, which solidifies the conclusion.\n\n*   **Conservation Law:** The most crucial point is that the problem is solved most efficiently by applying the law of conservation of atoms, which bypasses the need to identify the exact structures of the components of mixture X.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** To confirm the scenario is chemically sound, we can verify that a valid mixture X could exist. The components must be C₆ unsaturated rings that have **no conjugated multiple bonds**.\n    *   A plausible composition for mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Check 1 (Hydrogen Count):** The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which matches our calculation.\n    *   **Check 2 (Unsaturation):** Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Check 3 (Conjugation):** The problem explicitly states \"no conjugated multiple bonds.\" This constraint is critical. The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying this rule, whereas its isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded. The existence of this valid pair confirms the answer derived from the conservation law is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating all the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution. The reasoning across the provided candidate answers is highly consistent and logically sound, leading to a single robust conclusion.\n\n### **Systematic Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the final product, Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step for solving the entire problem. All candidate answers correctly identify Z first.\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `y / (12x + y)`. By setting this equal to 1/7, we can solve for the relationship between the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n    `y / (12x + y) = 1/7  =>  7y = 12x + y  =>  6y = 12x  =>  y = 2x`\n    Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Saturation:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene, which shares the same general formula, is unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Common Carbon Skeleton:** All starting materials in mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated to form *only* Z. This implies that all key compounds in the problem share the same carbon skeleton as Z. Given the reaction type is a disproportionation that produces an unreactive product mixture, a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton, as it allows for the formation of a very stable aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion for Z:** The only compound that fits all criteria—being a C₆ cycloalkane, a widely used solvent, and the result of these reactions—is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the second component:** The other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and must be convertible to cyclohexane via hydrogenation. To simultaneously satisfy the condition of not reacting with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆ ring compound that fits these criteria is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion for Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms**\nThis step uses the identities of the products to find the answer.\n*   **The Reaction:** The problem describes the conversion of an equimolar mixture X to the equimolar mixture Y as a \"disproportionation\" reaction on a platinum catalyst. In organic chemistry, this means a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall process can be written as:\n    `(Liquid from X₁) + (Liquid from X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4: The Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The most direct and robust method to solve the problem is to apply this fundamental law. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This total must equal the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms in mixture X = Total H atoms in mixture Y\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification of Plausibility**\nA final check ensures the entire chemical scenario is consistent.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Check against constraints for Mixture X:** Do two liquids exist that fit the description of mixture X? They must be C₆ ring compounds, unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms, and, critically, have **no conjugated multiple bonds**.\n*   **Plausible Candidates:** A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions.\n    *   Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds, satisfying the specific constraint which rules out its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\nThis verification confirms that the problem is well-posed and the answer derived from the law of conservation is correct.\n\nBased on the calculation, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logical flow found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe cornerstone of solving this problem is to first identify the substance Z. All sound analyses begin here.\n*   **Derive the Chemical Formula:** We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the hydrogen mass fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   This simplifies to `y = 2x`, giving Z the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Determine Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is fully saturated. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** The problem states that hydrogenation of all other substances yields *only* Z. This implies a common carbon skeleton among all reactants and products. The nature of the reaction (disproportionation on platinum, which often involves aromatic intermediates/products) and the fact that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly suggest a six-membered ring. The C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which perfectly fits all criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can deduce the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to produce only cyclohexane. Since this component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms**\nThis step uses the identities of the products to solve for the reactants.\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X (composed of X₁ and X₂) is converted to mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms:** This is the most crucial insight. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms in mixture X = Total H atoms in mixture Y\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Fundamental Law:** The most direct and robust way to solve this problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. This allows for the calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to know the exact identities of its components.\n2.  **Constraint Analysis:** Every piece of information is critical. The \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint is key for verifying the chemical plausibility of the reaction scheme. A potential mixture X, such as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), fits all conditions: their hydrogens sum to 18 (10 + 8), both are unsaturated, and the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated (non-conjugated). This confirms the problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Logical Flow:** The solution must be built sequentially. Identifying Z is the mandatory first step, followed by Y, which then allows the application of the conservation law to solve for X.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis unanimously shows that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Based on the options provided:\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided answers and the original problem statement, the correct solution can be found by following a clear, multi-step logical process. All sound analyses converge on the same reasoning and numerical result.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of Z is determined by combining three key pieces of information.\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 and solving gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z is a final product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** Hydrogenation of all mixtures yields *only* Z, implying all precursor molecules share a common carbon skeleton. Given Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent,\" and the reaction context involves six-membered rings (as deduced from the products), the only logical identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nNext, the composition of mixture Y can be determined.\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Components:** We are told Z (cyclohexane) is one component. The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since this second component does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical identity is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\nThe final answer can be found by applying a fundamental chemical principle to the reaction that forms mixture Y.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is heated with a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This reaction is a **disproportionation**, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall stoichiometry is:\n    `(Liquid X₁) + (Liquid X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Governing Principle:** The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** is the key to solving this problem efficiently. It states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n*   **The Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" Based on the principle of conservation, this total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Verification**\nA complete analysis includes checking for consistency with all given constraints to ensure the chemical scenario is plausible.\n*   **The most crucial point** is recognizing that the problem can be solved simply by using the law of conservation of atoms once the products (Mixture Y) are identified. This bypasses the need to identify the exact components of Mixture X.\n*   **Verification Check:** The components of mixture X must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated) but have no conjugated multiple bonds. A valid and plausible composition for mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. This pair fits all conditions:\n    1.  Their total hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18, matching our calculation.\n    2.  Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    3.  Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule. The existence of this valid pair confirms that the answer derived from the conservation law is correct and the problem is chemically sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the reasoning presented in the candidate answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step solution with all the careful points required to reach the correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe most logical and robust method to solve this problem is to work backward from the most well-defined substance (hydrocarbon Z), then identify the products (mixture Y), and finally apply a fundamental chemical law to deduce the properties of the reactants (mixture X).\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step upon which the entire solution rests. All sound analyses correctly identify Z first.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon, its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, it's saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), and a common solvent. Hydrogenation of all other compounds produces only Z, meaning they all share its carbon skeleton.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The mass percentage of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction **1/7**.\n    2.  For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`.\n    3.  Thus, the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n    4.  **A careful point on saturation:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is also saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene has the same general formula but is unsaturated.\n    5.  Given the reaction context involves six-membered rings (which are common in disproportionation reactions leading to aromatic products) and Z is a common solvent, the identity is pinpointed as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, the composition of mixture Y can be determined.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The components of Y must be either saturated or aromatic to not react with bromine water.\n    2.  The second component must hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane (as per the common carbon skeleton rule).\n    3.  **A careful point on chemical properties:** A compound with a C₆ skeleton that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water cannot be a cycloalkene. The only compound fitting these criteria is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    4.  Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nThis final step directly answers the question by leveraging a fundamental principle.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y. `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  A disproportionation, in this organic context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to cyclohexane, while the other is oxidized to benzene.\n    2.  The overall transformation is: `Liquid from X₁ + Liquid from X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    3.  **The most careful and crucial point:** The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** dictates that the total number of atoms of each element is conserved in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification (Plausibility Check)**\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically consistent, we confirm that a valid mixture X could exist.\n*   **Constraints on X:** The two components must be C₆ ring compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) but do not have conjugated multiple bonds. Their total hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n*   **A plausible composition for Mixture X:** **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint.\nThis check confirms that the problem is well-posed and the answer derived from the conservation law is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided answers and the original problem statement, a clear, step-by-step process reveals the correct answer. The reasoning across all sound solutions is identical.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of substance Z is deduced from three key pieces of information.\n\n*   **Mass Fraction to Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship: `7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x` -> `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation to Compound Type:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**, as an alkene with this formula would be unsaturated.\n*   **Context to Specific Identity:** The fact that all other compounds hydrogenate to form *only* Z means they share a common carbon skeleton. Given the reaction context (a disproportionation often involving stable aromatic ring formation), and Z's identity as a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical compound is the six-carbon cycloalkane, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\nThe composition of mixture Y can now be determined.\n\n*   **Properties of Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** Let the other liquid be Y₂. Since Y₂ hydrogenates to form only cyclohexane, it must also have a C₆ ring skeleton. For it to not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical choice is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which can be hydrogenated but is unreactive with bromine water.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation**. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The overall stoichiometry is: `(Liquid 1 from X) + (Liquid 2 from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 1: Law of Conservation of Atoms.** This fundamental principle is the most direct path to the solution. The total number of atoms for each element must be conserved.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. By the conservation law, this must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (mixture Y).\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**4. Careful Point 2: Verification of a Plausible Mixture X**\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically sound, we can verify that a suitable mixture X exists.\n\n*   **Constraints on X:** Its components must be unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), have non-conjugated multiple bonds, and both have a C₆ ring skeleton.\n*   **Plausible Mixture:** The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions.\n    *   The hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds.\n    *   Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint. This confirms the chemical scenario is well-posed and the answer is robust.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, the correct solution can be determined by systematically identifying the unknown substances and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe cornerstone of solving this problem is to first identify substance Z. This can be done by combining three key pieces of information provided in the problem statement.\n1.  **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n2.  **Saturation:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene with the same formula is unsaturated and would react further with hydrogen.\n3.  **Specific Identity:** We are told that all compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to produce *only* Z. This implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the reaction context involves disproportionation (which often leads to a stable aromatic ring), the most logical skeleton is a six-membered ring. The C₆ cycloalkane that fits all these criteria is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n1.  **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We know one component is Z, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n2.  **Second Component:** The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since this component does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆-ring compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive with bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y.\n1.  **The Reaction:** Mixture X undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y. Disproportionation, in this organic context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall process for the equimolar mixtures is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n2.  **Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Verification**\nA complete analysis includes checking that the entire scenario is chemically plausible.\n*   **The Power of Conservation Laws:** The most robust and direct way to solve the problem is by applying the law of conservation of atoms. This allows you to find the total hydrogen count in the reactants (X) by analyzing the products (Y), without needing to identify the specific components of X.\n*   **The \"No Conjugated Bonds\" Constraint:** We can verify that a plausible Mixture X exists. Its components must be unsaturated C₆-ring compounds whose total hydrogen count is 18 and which lack conjugated double bonds. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria. Their hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated. Critically, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, which satisfies the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule and distinguishes it from its conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The existence of this chemically valid pair confirms the reasoning is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for a correct solution.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\nThe most logical and efficient way to solve this problem is to work backward from the most clearly defined substance (Z) to the least defined (X).\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of hydrocarbon Z can be deduced from three key pieces of information provided.\n\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of H is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** All substances in the problem hydrogenate to produce *only* Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. Given that Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the reaction involves a disproportionation likely forming a stable aromatic product, a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton. The C₆ cycloalkane that fits all these descriptions is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (**cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂**). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Deduction:** The second component of Y must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane (due to the common skeleton rule). For this component to have a C₆ skeleton, be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and *not* react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical identity is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\nThe final answer can be found by applying a fundamental principle to the reaction connecting mixture X and mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes a **disproportionation** reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   **The Governing Principle (The Law of Conservation of Atoms):** The most direct way to solve the problem is to recognize that atoms are conserved in a chemical reaction. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Reaction: `(Liquid from X₁) + (Liquid from X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" Based on the conservation principle, this is equal to the total hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Identifying Z correctly:** The combination of mass fraction (leading to CₙH₂ₙ), saturation (making it a cycloalkane), and common chemical context (6-membered rings) is essential to pinpointing Z as cyclohexane.\n2.  **Using Conservation of Mass:** The most elegant and error-proof method is applying the law of conservation of atoms. This allows for a direct calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X *without* needing to identify its specific components.\n3.  **Checking Plausibility:** A thorough analysis involves verifying that a chemically plausible Mixture X exists. Its components must be unsaturated (to decolorize Br₂ water) and have no conjugated double bonds. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria:\n    *   Their hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint. This confirms the entire chemical scenario is valid.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 16\nB) 18\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to all constraints and logical deductions.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\nThe problem is best solved by working backward from the final product, substance Z, whose properties are the most clearly defined.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe identity of hydrocarbon Z is the foundation for solving the rest of the problem.\n*   **Mass Fraction Analysis:** We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y` → `6y = 12x` → `y = 2x`.\n    *   This establishes the general formula for Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation Analysis:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (unsaturated) or a cycloalkane (a saturated ring structure). The problem explicitly states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a fully saturated compound. Therefore, **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n*   **Structural Clues and Specific Identity:** The fact that all precursors (in mixtures X and Y) hydrogenate to *only* Z implies they all share a common carbon skeleton. The reaction context—a disproportionation often involving the formation of a stable aromatic ring—strongly points to a six-membered ring skeleton. The most common C₆ cycloalkane that is a \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This identification is consistent with the formula, properties, and reaction context.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Correctly combining the mass fraction, saturation status, and context clues is essential. Mistaking Z for an alkene would make the problem unsolvable. The identification of Z as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is the cornerstone of the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can now deduce the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We are also told that Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** Let the two components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The second component, Y₂, must also hydrogenate to produce only cyclohexane (to satisfy the \"gives only one substance, Z\" condition). This means Y₂ must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton. For Y₂ to hydrogenate to cyclohexane but be unreactive toward bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆ compound that fits this description is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe most direct path to the solution is by applying the law of conservation of mass to the reaction that forms Y from X.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation**. This is a type of reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it represents a hydrogen transfer. The overall reaction for one molecule of each component is:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms:** According to the Law of Conservation of Atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms is the most efficient and robust method. It allows you to find the total hydrogen count without needing to know the exact chemical structures of the two liquids in mixture X.\n\n**Step 4: Verification of Chemical Plausibility**\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically sound, we can verify that a mixture X fitting all descriptions can exist.\n*   **Mixture X must consist of two liquids that:**\n    1.  Have C₆ ring skeletons.\n    2.  Are unsaturated (so they decolorize bromine water).\n    3.  Have **no conjugated multiple bonds**.\n    4.  Have a combined hydrogen atom count of 18.\n*   A plausible composition for mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen Count:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both have double bonds.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** This is a crucial check. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint, which explicitly rules out its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). This confirms the problem is well-posed and our reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step logical deduction, working backward from the most defined product, Z, to the initial reactant mixture, X. The analysis across all candidate answers consistently follows the same robust logical path.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of Z is derived from several clues:\n*   **Mass Fraction of Hydrogen:** Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene with the same formula is unsaturated.\n*   **Identity:** All precursor substances hydrogenate to give *only* Z, meaning they all share a common carbon skeleton. Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the reaction involves a disproportionation likely forming an aromatic ring, a six-membered carbon skeleton is the most logical choice. The C₆ cycloalkane fitting these criteria is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y:\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which means its components must be either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Identity of the Second Component:** The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since it does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆-ring compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y:\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes a **disproportionation** reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This type of reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer. The overall reaction for one molecule of each component is:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Direct Path to Solution:** The most efficient solution relies on the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. This allows for the calculation of the hydrogen atoms in the reactants (X) by knowing the composition of the products (Y), without needing to identify the exact chemical structures in mixture X.\n2.  **Chemical Plausibility Check:** The solution's validity can be confirmed by ensuring a plausible Mixture X can exist. The components must be C₆ unsaturated ring compounds without conjugated bonds. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria:\n    *   Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic disproportionation.\n3.  **Correct Interpretation of Clues:** Each piece of information is critical: the mass percentage defines the formula type, the lack of reaction with hydrogen defines saturation, the reaction with bromine water differentiates between alkenes/aromatics, and the non-conjugated bond rule refines the structure of the potential reactants.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to each constraint and logical deduction.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThis is the foundational step, and the identity of Z can be determined with certainty from the information provided.\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and ultimately to `y = 2x`. This shows that the general formula for substance Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Saturated vs. Unsaturated.** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene (with a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which is a definitive indicator that it is a **saturated** compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form *only* Z. This implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. The nature of the disproportionation reaction strongly suggests a six-membered ring system, which allows for the formation of the highly stable aromatic ring of benzene. A six-carbon cycloalkane (C₆H₁₂) that is \"widely used as a solvent\" is unequivocally **cyclohexane**.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nWith Z identified, the composition of mixture Y can be deduced.\n\n*   **Analyze Mixture Y's Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Identify the Components:**\n    1.  We are told one component is Z, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n    2.  The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since it doesn't react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆-ring compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\n\nThis is the final step, where the answer is found by analyzing the conversion of X to Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X undergoes **disproportionation** on a platinum catalyst to form Mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid from X₁) + (Liquid from X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Law of Conservation of Atoms.** This is the most crucial principle for solving the problem efficiently. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reacting liquids from mixture X must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**4. Final Verification**\n\nTo ensure the problem is chemically consistent, we can check if a plausible Mixture X exists that fits all conditions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Checking Constraints for Mixture X.** The components of X must be unsaturated (to decolorize Br₂ water) and have **no conjugated multiple bonds**.\n*   **Plausible Components for X:** A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions.\n    *   **Hydrogen Sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both molecules have double bonds.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the specific constraint that rules out the conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic hydrogen transfer.\n\nThis verification confirms that the scenario is plausible and our answer derived from the law of conservation of atoms is correct. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and chemical principles, the solution can be derived through the following multi-step process.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of Z is derived from several key pieces of information.\n\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Specific Identity:** Hydrogenation of all other substances in the problem gives *only* Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. The reaction context (disproportionation often involving six-membered rings to achieve aromatic stability) and its use as a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly point to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nWith Z identified, we can now deduce the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Properties:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Second Component:** Since hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the second component must also have a C₆ skeleton. For it to be hydrogenated to cyclohexane but be unreactive with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical choice is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\n\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the reaction that connects mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid from X₁) + (Liquid from X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation vs. Identification:** The most direct and robust way to solve this problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. This allows the calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in the reactants (Mixture X) simply by identifying the products (Mixture Y), without needing to identify the exact components of X.\n\n2.  **Interpreting \"No Conjugated Multiple Bonds\":** This is a critical detail for verifying the chemical plausibility of the scenario. While mixture X contains unsaturated C₆ rings, the constraint rules out species like 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which has conjugated double bonds) in favor of species like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which has isolated double bonds).\n\n3.  **Verification of a Plausible Mixture X:** To confirm the reasoning is sound, we can check if a valid mixture X exists. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all conditions:\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings and decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Their combined hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic disproportionation (hydrogen transfer), validating the entire premise.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Matching this to the given options:\n\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a complex organic chemistry problem that can be solved systematically by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps. The consensus among the provided candidate answers follows a clear and logical path, which is detailed below.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe most effective strategy is to work backward from the most well-defined substance (Z), then identify the products (Mixture Y), and finally use a fundamental chemical law to deduce the properties of the reactants (Mixture X).\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of Z is derived from three key pieces of information:\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z is a final product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** All substances in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z, meaning they all share a common carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The reaction type (disproportionation) strongly suggests a six-membered ring is the common skeleton, as this allows for the formation of a stable aromatic ring. The six-carbon cycloalkane that fits all these descriptions is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Deduction:** The other liquid in Y must also hydrogenate to produce only cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆-ring compound that can be hydrogenated but is unreactive toward bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nThis final step directly answers the question by applying a fundamental principle.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y through a **disproportionation** reaction. In this organic chemistry context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid 1 from X) + (Liquid 2 from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Law of Conservation of Atoms:** This is the most critical principle for solving the problem. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same in the reactants and the products. The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n1.  **Conservation is Key:** The most efficient solution relies on the Law of Conservation of Atoms. This allows for a direct calculation of the hydrogen atoms in the reactants without needing to know their specific identities.\n2.  **Chemical Plausibility:** It is good practice to check if the scenario is chemically sound. A plausible mixture X must exist that fits all the conditions. The components must be C₆-ring compounds, be unsaturated, and have non-conjugated bonds. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria.\n    *   Their combined hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule. The existence of this valid pair confirms that the reasoning is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

    "Based on a systematic analysis of the provided answers, there is a clear and consistent logical path to solve the problem. The reasoning in every sound answer converges on the same key steps and numerical conclusion, although there is variation in which letter option they assign to the result.\n\n### **Systematic Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe most effective strategy, employed by all sound analyses, is to work backward from the most defined substance (Z) to the initial reactants (mixture X).\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of Z is determined by combining all its given properties:\n\n*   **Mass Fraction to Formula:** The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation to Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which confirms it is a fully saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Context to Specific Identity:** All reactants hydrogenate to give *only* Z, meaning they all share a common carbon skeleton. Given the reaction is a disproportionation (which in this context suggests dehydrogenation is possible, leading to a stable aromatic ring) and that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical structure is a six-membered ring. The C₆ cycloalkane that fits all criteria is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified as cyclohexane, the composition of mixture Y can be determined:\n\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to produce only cyclohexane. To do this and not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆ compound fitting these criteria is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer**\nThe final answer can be found by applying a fundamental chemical principle to the reaction:\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid from X₁) + (Liquid from X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Governing Principle:** The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **The Law of Conservation:** The most crucial insight, correctly identified in every coherent analysis, is that applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms provides the most direct path to the solution. It allows one to calculate the total hydrogen atoms in the reactants (X) by knowing the products (Y), without needing to identify the specific components of X.\n2.  **Chemical Tests:** Correctly interpreting the outcome of chemical tests is vital. \"Decolorizes bromine water\" implies the presence of carbon-carbon double or triple bonds. \"Does not decolorize\" implies a saturated or aromatic compound. \"Does not react further with hydrogen\" implies a fully saturated compound.\n3.  **The \"No Conjugated Multiple Bonds\" Constraint:** This is a key piece of information for confirming the chemical plausibility of the overall scheme. While not needed for the final calculation, it allows for the proposal of a valid Mixture X, such as **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. This pair satisfies all conditions: they sum to 18 hydrogen atoms (10+8), are unsaturated, have a C₆ skeleton, and the diene is non-conjugated.\n\nAll sound reasoning points to the fact that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y` → `6y = 12x` → `y = 2x`.\n    *   This shows that the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Importance of Saturation.**\n    A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which is the definitive clue that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Common Carbon Skeleton and Identity.**\n    The fact that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z is a critical clue. It implies that all precursor compounds share the same carbon skeleton. Given that Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the reaction context involves a disproportionation likely forming an aromatic ring, a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton. The C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which fits all the given criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Since the hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   For this second component to not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene.

The overall reaction for one molecule of each component is:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    The law dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.

The identity of substance Z is determined by systematically combining the given clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction.** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7. For any hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. By setting this equal to 1/7, we solve the equation: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and ultimately `y = 2x`. This shows that Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Clue 2: Saturation.** The problem states that Z is a final hydrogenation product that \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a fully saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Clue 3: Structure and Identity.** We are told that all compounds in the reaction scheme are converted to *only* Z upon hydrogenation, which implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. The nature of the disproportionation reaction (which involves dehydrogenation) strongly suggests a six-membered ring system, which allows for the formation of a stable aromatic ring. Combined with the clue that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. It is a common solvent, a C₆ cycloalkane, and fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, the composition of mixture Y can be determined.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Properties of Mixture Y.** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We are told Z (**cyclohexane**) is one component. The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like cyclohexane) or aromatic.\n*   **Clue 2: Hydrogenation Product.** The hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. Since one component is already cyclohexane, the other component must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. This confirms it has a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   **Deduction:** We are looking for a C₆ ring compound that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water. A cycloalkene is ruled out. The only substance that fits these criteria is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation via the Law of Conservation of Atoms**\nThis is the most direct method to answer the question.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y. We can write the overall transformation for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Law:** The Law of Conservation of Atoms states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" Based on the conservation principle, this total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one C₆H₁₂ molecule) + (H atoms in one C₆H₆ molecule)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Mass:** The most critical logical step is applying the law of conservation of mass. This allows the problem to be solved without definitively identifying the components of mixture X.\n2.  **The \"No Conjugated Bonds\" Rule:** To ensure the scenario is chemically plausible, we must check that a mixture X fitting all descriptions can exist. A key constraint is that it has no *conjugated* multiple bonds. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly.\n    *   The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Crucially, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated, satisfying the specific rule. The conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is thus excluded.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n3.  **Final Answer Consistency:** The robust reasoning from all steps consistently leads to the conclusion that the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.

The identity of substance Z is deduced from three key pieces of information:\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 and solving gives `12x = 6y`, which simplifies to the relationship `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene with the same formula is unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n*   **Specific Identity:** We are told that Z is the *sole* product of hydrogenating all other compounds, which implies they all share its carbon skeleton. The nature of the reaction (disproportionation) and Z's use as a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly suggest a six-membered ring system. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is a widely used solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity perfectly fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y:\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We are also told Z is a constituent of Y.\n*   **Known Component:** One component is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Unknown Component:** The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (since Z is the only final product). For this component to not decolorize bromine water but be hydrogenated, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical identity for a C₆-ring compound that fits these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the reaction that connects mixture X and mixture Y.\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this organic chemistry context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall stoichiometry for the equimolar mixtures is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Governing Principle:** A fundamental principle of chemistry is the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**, which states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n*   **The Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". Based on the conservation principle, this must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Verification**\nA thorough analysis includes checking for consistency with all given constraints, which solidifies the conclusion.\n\n*   **Conservation Law:** The most crucial point is that the problem is solved most efficiently by applying the law of conservation of atoms, which bypasses the need to identify the exact structures of the components of mixture X.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** To confirm the scenario is chemically sound, we can verify that a valid mixture X could exist. The components must be C₆ unsaturated rings that have **no conjugated multiple bonds**.\n    *   A plausible composition for mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Check 1 (Hydrogen Count):** The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which matches our calculation.\n    *   **Check 2 (Unsaturation):** Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Check 3 (Conjugation):** The problem explicitly states \"no conjugated multiple bonds.\" This constraint is critical. The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying this rule, whereas its isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded. The existence of this valid pair confirms the answer derived from the conservation law is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating all the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution. The reasoning across the provided candidate answers is highly consistent and logically sound, leading to a single robust conclusion.\n\n### **Systematic Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the final product, Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step for solving the entire problem. All candidate answers correctly identify Z first.\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `y / (12x + y)`. By setting this equal to 1/7, we can solve for the relationship between the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n    `y / (12x + y) = 1/7  =>  7y = 12x + y  =>  6y = 12x  =>  y = 2x`\n    Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Saturation:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene, which shares the same general formula, is unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Common Carbon Skeleton:** All starting materials in mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated to form *only* Z. This implies that all key compounds in the problem share the same carbon skeleton as Z. Given the reaction type is a disproportionation that produces an unreactive product mixture, a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton, as it allows for the formation of a very stable aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion for Z:** The only compound that fits all criteria—being a C₆ cycloalkane, a widely used solvent, and the result of these reactions—is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the second component:** The other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and must be convertible to cyclohexane via hydrogenation. To simultaneously satisfy the condition of not reacting with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆ ring compound that fits these criteria is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion for Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms**\nThis step uses the identities of the products to find the answer.\n*   **The Reaction:** The problem describes the conversion of an equimolar mixture X to the equimolar mixture Y as a \"disproportionation\" reaction on a platinum catalyst. In organic chemistry, this means a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall process can be written as:\n    `(Liquid from X₁) + (Liquid from X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4: The Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The most direct and robust method to solve the problem is to apply this fundamental law. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This total must equal the sum of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms in mixture X = Total H atoms in mixture Y\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification of Plausibility**\nA final check ensures the entire chemical scenario is consistent.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Check against constraints for Mixture X:** Do two liquids exist that fit the description of mixture X? They must be C₆ ring compounds, unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms, and, critically, have **no conjugated multiple bonds**.\n*   **Plausible Candidates:** A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions.\n    *   Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds, satisfying the specific constraint which rules out its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\nThis verification confirms that the problem is well-posed and the answer derived from the law of conservation is correct.\n\nBased on the calculation, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logical flow found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe cornerstone of solving this problem is to first identify the substance Z. All sound analyses begin here.\n*   **Derive the Chemical Formula:** We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the hydrogen mass fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   This simplifies to `y = 2x`, giving Z the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Determine Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is fully saturated. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** The problem states that hydrogenation of all other substances yields *only* Z. This implies a common carbon skeleton among all reactants and products. The nature of the reaction (disproportionation on platinum, which often involves aromatic intermediates/products) and the fact that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly suggest a six-membered ring. The C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which perfectly fits all criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can deduce the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to produce only cyclohexane. Since this component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms**\nThis step uses the identities of the products to solve for the reactants.\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X (composed of X₁ and X₂) is converted to mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms:** This is the most crucial insight. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms in mixture X = Total H atoms in mixture Y\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Fundamental Law:** The most direct and robust way to solve this problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. This allows for the calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to know the exact identities of its components.\n2.  **Constraint Analysis:** Every piece of information is critical. The \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint is key for verifying the chemical plausibility of the reaction scheme. A potential mixture X, such as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), fits all conditions: their hydrogens sum to 18 (10 + 8), both are unsaturated, and the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated (non-conjugated). This confirms the problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Logical Flow:** The solution must be built sequentially. Identifying Z is the mandatory first step, followed by Y, which then allows the application of the conservation law to solve for X.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis unanimously shows that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Based on the options provided:\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided answers and the original problem statement, the correct solution can be found by following a clear, multi-step logical process. All sound analyses converge on the same reasoning and numerical result.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of Z is determined by combining three key pieces of information.\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 and solving gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z is a final product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** Hydrogenation of all mixtures yields *only* Z, implying all precursor molecules share a common carbon skeleton. Given Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent,\" and the reaction context involves six-membered rings (as deduced from the products), the only logical identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nNext, the composition of mixture Y can be determined.\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Components:** We are told Z (cyclohexane) is one component. The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since this second component does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical identity is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\nThe final answer can be found by applying a fundamental chemical principle to the reaction that forms mixture Y.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is heated with a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This reaction is a **disproportionation**, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall stoichiometry is:\n    `(Liquid X₁) + (Liquid X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Governing Principle:** The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** is the key to solving this problem efficiently. It states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n*   **The Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" Based on the principle of conservation, this total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Verification**\nA complete analysis includes checking for consistency with all given constraints to ensure the chemical scenario is plausible.\n*   **The most crucial point** is recognizing that the problem can be solved simply by using the law of conservation of atoms once the products (Mixture Y) are identified. This bypasses the need to identify the exact components of Mixture X.\n*   **Verification Check:** The components of mixture X must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated) but have no conjugated multiple bonds. A valid and plausible composition for mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. This pair fits all conditions:\n    1.  Their total hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18, matching our calculation.\n    2.  Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    3.  Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule. The existence of this valid pair confirms that the answer derived from the conservation law is correct and the problem is chemically sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the reasoning presented in the candidate answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step solution with all the careful points required to reach the correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe most logical and robust method to solve this problem is to work backward from the most well-defined substance (hydrocarbon Z), then identify the products (mixture Y), and finally apply a fundamental chemical law to deduce the properties of the reactants (mixture X).\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step upon which the entire solution rests. All sound analyses correctly identify Z first.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon, its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, it's saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), and a common solvent. Hydrogenation of all other compounds produces only Z, meaning they all share its carbon skeleton.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The mass percentage of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction **1/7**.\n    2.  For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`.\n    3.  Thus, the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n    4.  **A careful point on saturation:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is also saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene has the same general formula but is unsaturated.\n    5.  Given the reaction context involves six-membered rings (which are common in disproportionation reactions leading to aromatic products) and Z is a common solvent, the identity is pinpointed as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, the composition of mixture Y can be determined.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The components of Y must be either saturated or aromatic to not react with bromine water.\n    2.  The second component must hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane (as per the common carbon skeleton rule).\n    3.  **A careful point on chemical properties:** A compound with a C₆ skeleton that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water cannot be a cycloalkene. The only compound fitting these criteria is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    4.  Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nThis final step directly answers the question by leveraging a fundamental principle.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y. `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  A disproportionation, in this organic context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to cyclohexane, while the other is oxidized to benzene.\n    2.  The overall transformation is: `Liquid from X₁ + Liquid from X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    3.  **The most careful and crucial point:** The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** dictates that the total number of atoms of each element is conserved in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification (Plausibility Check)**\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically consistent, we confirm that a valid mixture X could exist.\n*   **Constraints on X:** The two components must be C₆ ring compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) but do not have conjugated multiple bonds. Their total hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n*   **A plausible composition for Mixture X:** **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint.\nThis check confirms that the problem is well-posed and the answer derived from the conservation law is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided answers and the original problem statement, a clear, step-by-step process reveals the correct answer.

The identity of substance Z is deduced from three key pieces of information.\n\n*   **Mass Fraction to Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship: `7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x` -> `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation to Compound Type:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**, as an alkene with this formula would be unsaturated.\n*   **Context to Specific Identity:** The fact that all other compounds hydrogenate to form *only* Z means they share a common carbon skeleton. Given the reaction context (a disproportionation often involving stable aromatic ring formation), and Z's identity as a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical compound is the six-carbon cycloalkane, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\nThe composition of mixture Y can now be determined.\n\n*   **Properties of Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** Let the other liquid be Y₂. Since Y₂ hydrogenates to form only cyclohexane, it must also have a C₆ ring skeleton. For it to not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical choice is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which can be hydrogenated but is unreactive with bromine water.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation**.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, the correct solution can be determined by systematically identifying the unknown substances and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe cornerstone of solving this problem is to first identify substance Z. This can be done by combining three key pieces of information provided in the problem statement.\n1.  **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n2.  **Saturation:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene with the same formula is unsaturated and would react further with hydrogen.\n3.  **Specific Identity:** We are told that all compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to produce *only* Z. This implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the reaction context involves disproportionation (which often leads to a stable aromatic ring), the most logical skeleton is a six-membered ring. The C₆ cycloalkane that fits all these criteria is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n1.  **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We know one component is Z, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n2.  **Second Component:** The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since this component does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆-ring compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive with bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y.\n1.  **The Reaction:** Mixture X undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y. Disproportionation, in this organic context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall process for the equimolar mixtures is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n2.  **Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Verification**\nA complete analysis includes checking that the entire scenario is chemically plausible.\n*   **The Power of Conservation Laws:** The most robust and direct way to solve the problem is by applying the law of conservation of atoms. This allows you to find the total hydrogen count in the reactants (X) by analyzing the products (Y), without needing to identify the specific components of X.\n*   **The \"No Conjugated Bonds\" Constraint:** We can verify that a plausible Mixture X exists. Its components must be unsaturated C₆-ring compounds whose total hydrogen count is 18 and which lack conjugated double bonds. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria. Their hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated. Critically, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, which satisfies the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule and distinguishes it from its conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The existence of this chemically valid pair confirms the reasoning is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for a correct solution.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\nThe most logical and efficient way to solve this problem is to work backward from the most clearly defined substance (Z) to the least defined (X).\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of hydrocarbon Z can be deduced from three key pieces of information provided.\n\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of H is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** All substances in the problem hydrogenate to produce *only* Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. Given that Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the reaction involves a disproportionation likely forming a stable aromatic product, a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton. The C₆ cycloalkane that fits all these descriptions is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (**cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂**). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Deduction:** The second component of Y must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane (due to the common skeleton rule). For this component to have a C₆ skeleton, be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and *not* react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical identity is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\nThe final answer can be found by applying a fundamental principle to the reaction connecting mixture X and mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes a **disproportionation** reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   **The Governing Principle (The Law of Conservation of Atoms):** The most direct way to solve the problem is to recognize that atoms are conserved in a chemical reaction. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Reaction: `(Liquid from X₁) + (Liquid from X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" Based on the conservation principle, this is equal to the total hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Identifying Z correctly:** The combination of mass fraction (leading to CₙH₂ₙ), saturation (making it a cycloalkane), and common chemical context (6-membered rings) is essential to pinpointing Z as cyclohexane.\n2.  **Using Conservation of Mass:** The most elegant and error-proof method is applying the law of conservation of atoms. This allows for a direct calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X *without* needing to identify its specific components.\n3.  **Checking Plausibility:** A thorough analysis involves verifying that a chemically plausible Mixture X exists. Its components must be unsaturated (to decolorize Br₂ water) and have no conjugated double bonds. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria:\n    *   Their hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint. This confirms the entire chemical scenario is valid.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 16\nB) 18\nC) 12\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to all constraints and logical deductions.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\nThe problem is best solved by working backward from the final product, substance Z, whose properties are the most clearly defined.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe identity of hydrocarbon Z is the foundation for solving the rest of the problem.\n*   **Mass Fraction Analysis:** We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y` → `6y = 12x` → `y = 2x`.\n    *   This establishes the general formula for Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation Analysis:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (unsaturated) or a cycloalkane (a saturated ring structure). The problem explicitly states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a fully saturated compound. Therefore, **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n*   **Structural Clues and Specific Identity:** The fact that all precursors (in mixtures X and Y) hydrogenate to *only* Z implies they all share a common carbon skeleton. The reaction context—a disproportionation often involving the formation of a stable aromatic ring—strongly points to a six-membered ring skeleton. The most common C₆ cycloalkane that is a \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This identification is consistent with the formula, properties, and reaction context.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Correctly combining the mass fraction, saturation status, and context clues is essential. Mistaking Z for an alkene would make the problem unsolvable. The identification of Z as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is the cornerstone of the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can now deduce the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We are also told that Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** Let the two components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The second component, Y₂, must also hydrogenate to produce only cyclohexane (to satisfy the \"gives only one substance, Z\" condition). This means Y₂ must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton. For Y₂ to hydrogenate to cyclohexane but be unreactive toward bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆ compound that fits this description is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe most direct path to the solution is by applying the law of conservation of mass to the reaction that forms Y from X.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation**. This is a type of reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it represents a hydrogen transfer. The overall reaction for one molecule of each component is:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms:** According to the Law of Conservation of Atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms is the most efficient and robust method. It allows you to find the total hydrogen count without needing to know the exact chemical structures of the two liquids in mixture X.\n\n**Step 4: Verification of Chemical Plausibility**\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically sound, we can verify that a mixture X fitting all descriptions can exist.\n*   **Mixture X must consist of two liquids that:**\n    1.  Have C₆ ring skeletons.\n    2.  Are unsaturated (so they decolorize bromine water).\n    3.  Have **no conjugated multiple bonds**.\n    4.  Have a combined hydrogen atom count of 18.\n*   A plausible composition for mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen Count:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both have double bonds.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** This is a crucial check. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint, which explicitly rules out its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). This confirms the problem is well-posed and our reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step logical deduction, working backward from the most defined product, Z, to the initial reactant mixture, X. The analysis across all candidate answers consistently follows the same robust logical path.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of Z is derived from several clues:\n*   **Mass Fraction of Hydrogen:** Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene with the same formula is unsaturated.\n*   **Identity:** All precursor substances hydrogenate to give *only* Z, meaning they all share a common carbon skeleton. Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and the reaction involves a disproportionation likely forming an aromatic ring, a six-membered carbon skeleton is the most logical choice. The C₆ cycloalkane fitting these criteria is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\nWith Z identified, we can determine the composition of mixture Y:\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" which means its components must be either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Identity of the Second Component:** The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since it does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆-ring compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\nThe final answer is found by analyzing the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y:\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X undergoes a **disproportionation** reaction on a heated platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This type of reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer. The overall reaction for one molecule of each component is:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Direct Path to Solution:** The most efficient solution relies on the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. This allows for the calculation of the hydrogen atoms in the reactants (X) by knowing the composition of the products (Y), without needing to identify the exact chemical structures in mixture X.\n2.  **Chemical Plausibility Check:** The solution's validity can be confirmed by ensuring a plausible Mixture X can exist. The components must be C₆ unsaturated ring compounds without conjugated bonds. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria:\n    *   Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint. The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic disproportionation.\n3.  **Correct Interpretation of Clues:** Each piece of information is critical: the mass percentage defines the formula type, the lack of reaction with hydrogen defines saturation, the reaction with bromine water differentiates between alkenes/aromatics, and the non-conjugated bond rule refines the structure of the potential reactants.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to each constraint and logical deduction.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThis is the foundational step, and the identity of Z can be determined with certainty from the information provided.\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and ultimately to `y = 2x`. This shows that the general formula for substance Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Saturated vs. Unsaturated.** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene (with a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which is a definitive indicator that it is a **saturated** compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form *only* Z. This implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. The nature of the disproportionation reaction strongly suggests a six-membered ring system, which allows for the formation of the highly stable aromatic ring of benzene. A six-carbon cycloalkane (C₆H₁₂) that is \"widely used as a solvent\" is unequivocally **cyclohexane**.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nWith Z identified, the composition of mixture Y can be deduced.\n\n*   **Analyze Mixture Y's Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Identify the Components:**\n    1.  We are told one component is Z, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n    2.  The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. Since it doesn't react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only C₆-ring compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\n\nThis is the final step, where the answer is found by analyzing the conversion of X to Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X undergoes **disproportionation** on a platinum catalyst to form Mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid from X₁) + (Liquid from X₂) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Law of Conservation of Atoms.** This is the most crucial principle for solving the problem efficiently. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reacting liquids from mixture X must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**4. Final Verification**\n\nTo ensure the problem is chemically consistent, we can check if a plausible Mixture X exists that fits all conditions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Checking Constraints for Mixture X.** The components of X must be unsaturated (to decolorize Br₂ water) and have **no conjugated multiple bonds**.\n*   **Plausible Components for X:** A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions.\n    *   **Hydrogen Sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both molecules have double bonds.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the specific constraint that rules out the conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic hydrogen transfer.\n\nThis verification confirms that the scenario is plausible and our answer derived from the law of conservation of atoms is correct. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and chemical principles, the solution can be derived through the following multi-step process.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThis is the foundational step.

One component is Z (cyclohexane). It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Second Component:** Since hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the second component must also have a C₆ skeleton.
