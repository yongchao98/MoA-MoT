All of the candidate answers have correctly identified the key principles, which can be synthesized into a single, definitive logical path.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nFirst, we must determine which functional group each reducing agent reacts with. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two relevant groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted. Therefore, in reaction A, the ester group is reduced.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters largely unreacted under these conditions. Therefore, in reaction B, the carboxylic acid group is reduced.\n\n**2. Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis**\n\nThis step is the most crucial for determining the stereochemical outcome. While the reactions do not break any bonds *at* the chiral center, they modify the groups attached to the carbon chain, which can change their CIP priority and potentially invert the R/S label.\n\n*   **Assigning Initial Priorities:** The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups. We must rank them:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  The arm containing the acid: `-CH₂COOH`\n    4.  The arm containing the ester: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\n    The key comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. We follow the chains from the chiral center until we find a point of difference. For the ester, the chain includes `-C(=O)-O-`**`C`**`H₂-`... whereas for the acid, it is `-C(=O)-O-`**`H`**. Since a Carbon atom has a higher atomic number than a Hydrogen atom, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n\n    The correct priority order is:\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n**3. Analyzing the Outcome of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: The ester group (original **P1**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original **P2**) is untouched.\n*   **Priority Change**: In the resulting intermediate, we now compare the untouched acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group now has higher priority.\n*   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was P1 is now lower priority than the group that was P2. The priority order of the top two groups is **swapped**. A swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Outcome of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: The acid group (original **P2**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original **P1**) is untouched.\n*   **Priority Change**: We now compare the untouched ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group remains the higher priority group.\n*   **Stereochemical Result**: The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is **maintained**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nThe analysis from every step consistently leads to the same conclusion:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the one where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is an advanced organic chemistry problem that requires a detailed, two-part analysis. An examination of the provided candidate answers shows a remarkable consistency in their underlying chemical reasoning. The correct conclusion can be reached by synthesizing their consensus logic.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe first step is to understand what each reagent does. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids untouched. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n*   **Reaction B (`B + BH₃`)**: Borane (`BH₃`) exhibits the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted. This is also correctly identified by all candidates.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Analysis via Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical and decisive part of the analysis. While the actual 3D configuration of the chiral center is preserved, its R/S *designation* can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the attached groups.\n\n*   **Part 2a: Assigning Initial CIP Priorities**\n    The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To assign priority, the acid arm and ester arm must be compared. Following the chain from C3, the first point of difference is the atom bonded to the carboxyl/alkoxy oxygen. In the ester arm, the oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom (`-O-C...`). In the acid arm, the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom (`-O-H`). Since Carbon (atomic number 6) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (atomic number 1), the ester arm receives higher priority. All candidate answers agree on this ranking.\n\n    The correct priority order is:\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n*   **Part 2b: Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n    *   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`\n    *   **Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the ester arm (the highest priority group, P1) into a primary alcohol. The acid arm (P2) is unaffected.\n    *   **Change in Priority**: In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid, the untouched acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Conclusion**: The group that was originally P1 becomes lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. This **swapping** of the top two priorities causes an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation. Therefore, to obtain the **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Part 2c: Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n    *   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`\n    *   **Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the acid arm (P2) into a primary alcohol. The ester arm (P1) is unaffected.\n    *   **Change in Priority**: In the resulting 5-hydroxy ester, the untouched ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The priority ranking of the two main arms is preserved (P1 remains the highest priority group). This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation. Therefore, to obtain the **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning from all candidate answers leads to a single conclusion:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the choice where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer. Matching this conclusion to the provided options:\n\nA) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nB) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nC) A = (R)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nD) A = (S)-acid, B = (S)-acid\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the provided answers, there is a clear consensus on the underlying chemical principles. The variation in the final lettered choices from the agents appears to stem from randomized multiple-choice options, but the core reasoning is unanimous and sound.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity\nThis step determines which functional group on the starting material is reduced in each reaction.\n*   **Starting Material**: The compound, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) group.\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities for the Starting Material\nThis is the most critical step to determine the stereochemical outcome. We must establish the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3).\n*   The four groups are: -H (hydrogen), -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n*   To rank the acid arm versus the ester arm, we look for the first point of difference along the chains. For the ester arm, the alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom (`-O-C...`). For the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom (`-O-H`).\n*   According to CIP rules, Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen. Therefore, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **The initial priority order is:**\n    1.  **P1 (Highest):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    2.  **P2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  **P4 (Lowest):** `-H`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: The **ester arm (P1)** is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **acid arm (P2)** is untouched. The resulting molecule cyclizes to the lactone, with the carbonyl coming from the acid group.\n*   **Priority Change**: In the resulting intermediate, the untouched acid arm is now higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original P1 group has been transformed into a group that is lower in priority than the original P2 group. Therefore, the priorities of the top two groups have been **swapped**.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion**: A swap in the priorities of two groups results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation. To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: The **acid arm (P2)** is reduced to a primary alcohol. The **ester arm (P1)** is untouched. The resulting molecule cyclizes to the lactone, with the carbonyl coming from the ester group.\n*   **Priority Change**: The untouched ester arm (P1) is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The priority ordering of the two main arms is preserved.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion**: Since the relative priority of the highest-ranked groups is maintained, the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation. To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nThe detailed analysis concludes that:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nLooking at the provided options:\nA) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nB) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nC) A = (S)-acid , B = (S)-acid\nD) A = (R)-acid , B = (R)-acid\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a multi-step chemical analysis, which can be broken down into several careful points. An examination of the provided candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the underlying chemical principles. The final correct answer is derived from this consistent logic.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis & Careful Points**\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity:** The first step is to understand what each reducing agent does. The starting material has both an ester and a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent that reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol while leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester group intact.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Analysis via Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules:** This is the most critical part of the problem. While the physical 3D arrangement of groups around the chiral center is preserved, the *R/S designation* can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the groups.\n\n    *   **Assigning Initial Priorities:** The chiral carbon (C3) is attached to four groups. We must rank their priority:\n        1. `-H` (Hydrogen)\n        2. `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        3. `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n        4. `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n        The crucial comparison is between the acid and ester arms. Looking at the first point of difference, the oxygen in the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-`**C**`...`) is bonded to a Carbon atom. The oxygen in the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-`**H**) is bonded to a Hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm receives the higher priority.\n\n        The correct initial priority order is:\n        **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu` > **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH` > **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃` > **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n**3. Tracing Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`**\n    *   **Transformation:** The `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group**, which was the original Priority 1 group. The carboxylic acid group (Priority 2) is unaffected.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate, the untouched carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has become a lower priority group than the group that was originally Priority 2. This swapping of the top two priorities causes an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation. To produce an **(R)**-lactone via inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Tracing Reaction B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`**\n    *   **Transformation:** The `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group**, which was the original Priority 2 group. The ester group (Priority 1) is unaffected.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxy ester intermediate, the untouched ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is still a higher priority group than the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The priority ordering of the top two groups is maintained (the original Priority 1 group is still Priority 1). This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation. To produce an **(S)**-lactone via retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the consistent analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a complex organic stereochemistry problem that requires a rigorous step-by-step analysis. An examination of the candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus on the core chemical reasoning, with discrepancies in the final letter choices arising only from differently ordered multiple-choice options. The correct logical pathway is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**\n*   **Starting Material**: The problem uses stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is bifunctional, containing both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at the C3 carbon.\n*   **Reagents**:\n    *   **Reaction A uses LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**: This reagent is known for its chemoselectivity. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not readily reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B uses BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted under the same conditions.\n\n**2. Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\nThis is the most critical step, as it determines how the chemical transformation affects the R/S stereochemical label. The absolute 3D configuration at the chiral center is preserved, but the label can change if the group priorities are altered.\n\n*   The four groups attached to the chiral C3 center are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), a chain containing the carboxylic acid (`-CH₂COOH`, the \"acid arm\"), and a chain containing the ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`, the \"ester arm\").\n*   To rank the acid and ester arms, we follow the CIP rules and look for the first point of difference.\n    *   Ester arm: `-CH₂-CO-O-`**C**`H₂-...`\n    *   Acid arm: `-CH₂-CO-O-`**H**\n*   The ester's oxygen is attached to a carbon atom, while the acid's oxygen is attached to a hydrogen atom. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   The unanimous and correct priority order is:\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1)**: `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2)**: `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3)**: `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4)**: `-H`\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unaffected and goes on to form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n*   **Priority Change**: In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate, the untouched acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group. The group that was originally P1 is now lower in priority than the group that was originally P2.\n*   **Result**: The priority ranking of the top two groups is **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds via inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected and forms the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n*   **Priority Change**: In the resulting 5-hydroxy ester intermediate, the untouched ester group (P1) is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol group (from the reduction of P2).\n*   **Result**: The priority order of the two main arms is **preserved**. The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds via retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Final Determination**\n\nBased on a thorough and consistent analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nTherefore, both reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires a detailed analysis of two reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the stereochemical consequences determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. A systematic breakdown is the most effective approach.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity**\nThe first step is to determine which functional group each reducing agent will react with on the starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`).\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The reagent is `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride). It is a chemoselective agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, in reaction A, the **ester group is reduced**.\n*   **Reaction B:** The reagent is `BH₃` (Borane). It exhibits the opposite selectivity, readily reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted. Therefore, in reaction B, the **carboxylic acid group is reduced**.\n\nIn both cases, the resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-carbonyl compound that cyclizes under acidic workup (H+) to form the final lactone product.\n\n**2. Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Assignment**\nThis step is critical for determining the stereochemical outcome. Even though the bonds at the chiral center (C3) are not broken, the reaction can change the chemical nature of the attached groups, which may alter their CIP priority and thus change the R/S designation.\n\n*   The four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   To rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom from the chiral center. The first point of difference is at the oxygen of the carboxyl/ester functionality. In the acid arm (`-O-H`), this oxygen is bonded to a Hydrogen. In the ester arm (`-O-iBu`), it is bonded to a Carbon. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n*   **Initial Priority Order:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n**3. Stereochemical Analysis of Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **ester arm (P1)** is reduced to a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **acid arm (P2)** is unaffected.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting molecule, the acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally P1 is now lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A swap in priorities results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**4. Stereochemical Analysis of Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **acid arm (P2)** is reduced to a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **ester arm (P1)** is unaffected.\n*   **Priority Change:** The untouched ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The original highest-priority group (P1) remains the highest-priority group. The relative priority order is **maintained**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\nThe chemical analysis concludes that both starting materials must have the same stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of two separate reactions, focusing on two key aspects of organic chemistry: the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the reactions as determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers is remarkably consistent and provides a clear path to the correct solution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis consolidating the unanimous reasoning:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThis step determines which functional group on the starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, reacts in each case.\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a reagent that selectively reduces the **ester** functional group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is left untouched.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity. It reduces the **carboxylic acid** functional group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group (`-COOiBu`) untouched.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step to determine the stereochemical outcome. While the 3D configuration of the chiral center does not change, the R/S label can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituent groups.\n*   **The Chiral Center:** The chiral carbon is C3.\n*   **Attached Groups:** It is attached to `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   **Priority Ranking:** To rank the two main arms, we look at the first point of difference from the chiral center. In the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a carbon (`-O-C...`). In the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen (`-O-H`). Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n\nThe established priority order is:\n*   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n*   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n*   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n*   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H` (Hydrogen)\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **ester group (P1)** is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, the unchanged acid arm now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The group that was originally P1 is now lower in priority than the group that was originally P2.\n*   **Result:** The priority of the top two groups is **swapped**. This swap results in a formal **inversion** of the stereochemical designation (e.g., an S reactant becomes an R product).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product via this inversion pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **acid group (P2)** is reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, the unchanged ester arm (P1) is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Result:** The relative priority order of the two main arms is **preserved**. This results in a formal **retention** of the stereochemical designation (e.g., an S reactant becomes an S product).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product via this retention pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the consistent analysis from all steps, both reactions must start with the same stereoisomer:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result matches option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires a detailed analysis of both reagent selectivity and the resulting stereochemistry. A step-by-step breakdown based on the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers is as follows.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\nThe first step is to understand what each reducing agent does. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols. It is not strong enough to reduce the carboxylic acid group under these conditions.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity. It preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters largely unreacted.\n\n**2. Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\nThis step is critical for determining the stereochemical outcome. We must rank the priority of the four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) of the starting material.\n*   The groups are: -H (Hydrogen), -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n*   To rank the acid arm versus the ester arm, we look for the first point of difference. For the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom (of the isobutyl group): `–O–C`. For the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom: `–O–H`.\n*   Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   The final priority ranking for the starting material is:\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A: A → (R)-Lactone**\n*   **Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (P1) to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priority**: In the resulting intermediate, we must compare the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm now has higher priority.\n*   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 has become lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority of the top two groups is swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that causes inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B: B → (S)-Lactone**\n*   **Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the acid group (P2) to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priority**: We compare the unchanged ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm is still higher in priority.\n*   **Stereochemical Result**: The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is preserved. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nThe analysis shows that both starting materials must have the same configuration:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B in the provided question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a detailed, step-by-step analysis of two distinct chemical reactions. The solution relies on two key concepts in organic chemistry: the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences determined by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The reasoning provided by all candidate answers is remarkably consistent, confirming a single logical pathway to the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThe first step is to determine which functional group each reagent will reduce on the starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄)**: Lithium borohydride is a reagent known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols, leaving carboxylic acids intact under these reaction conditions.\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters unreacted.\n\n**2. Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Assignment**\n\nThis step is crucial for determining the stereochemical outcome. While the 3D structure at the chiral center is preserved, the R/S *label* can change if the reaction alters the priority of the attached groups.\n\n*   **Chiral Center (C3) Groups**: The four groups attached are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   **Priority Ranking**: To rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom from the chiral center. The point of difference is found in the final part of the functional group: the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon (`-O-C...`), while the acid's oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen (`-O-H`). Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm receives higher priority.\n*   **The unanimous priority order is**: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`\n\n**3. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation**: The **ester arm** (the group with the highest priority) is reduced to a primary alcohol. The acid arm (the second-highest priority group) is untouched.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence**: After the reaction, the unchanged acid arm now has a higher CIP priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original highest-priority group has become lower in priority than the original second-highest group. This **swapping** of the top two priorities results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion**: For starting material **A** to form an **(R)** product through a reaction that causes inversion, A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**4. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation**: The **acid arm** (the group with the second-highest priority) is reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester arm (the highest priority group) is untouched.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence**: The ester arm remains the highest priority group, while the newly formed alcohol arm is still of lower priority. The priority order of the two main arms is **preserved**. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion**: For starting material **B** to form an **(S)** product through a reaction that proceeds with retention, B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nThe detailed analysis consistently leads to the following conclusion, which is supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers:\n\n*   Starting Material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two separate organic reactions, focusing on two key aspects:\n1.  **Chemoselectivity**: Which functional group each reducing agent preferentially attacks.\n2.  **Stereochemistry**: How the chemical transformation affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) designation of the single chiral center.\n\nAll of the provided candidate answers correctly identify and follow these two main analytical steps. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the multiple-choice options being shuffled, but the underlying chemical reasoning is sound and consistent across all answers. Here is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step 1: Reagent Chemoselectivity\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, possesses two reducible functional groups: an ester (`-COOiBu`) and a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The two reagents have opposite selectivities.\n\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reagent that reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol while leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing the **carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester untouched.\n\n### Step 2: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis\n\nThis is the most critical step. The absolute 3D arrangement of groups at the chiral center is preserved in both reactions. However, the *R/S* label can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center's carbon chain.\n\n*   **Initial Priority Assignment**: We must assign priorities to the four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) of the starting material.\n    1.  The \"ester arm\": `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    2.  The \"acid arm\": `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  The ethyl group: `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  The hydrogen atom: `-H`\n\n    To compare the ester and acid arms, we find the first point of difference along the chains. The ester's alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a Carbon atom (`-O-`**C**), while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a Hydrogen atom (`-O-`**H**). Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm receives a higher priority.\n\n    *   **The correct priority order is:**\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (**P1**) is reduced to an alcohol. The acid group (**P2**) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has become a lower priority group than the group that was originally Priority 2. This swapping of the top two priorities results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For a starting material `A` to produce an **(R)**-lactone through a reaction that causes inversion, `A` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (**P2**) is reduced to an alcohol. The ester group (**P1**) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxy ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The priority order of the top two groups is preserved (the original P1 group remains P1). This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For a starting material `B` to produce an **(S)**-lactone through a reaction that proceeds with retention, `B` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding that the two reducing agents, `LiBH₄` and `BH₃`, target different functional groups within the same starting molecule.\n*   **Starting Material:** The base molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which contains both an **ester** group (`-COOiBu`) and a **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`).\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome depends on whether the chemical reaction changes the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3). This determines if the R/S label is retained or inverted.\n\n*   **Groups at the Chiral Center (C3):**\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   **Priority Comparison:** The crucial comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. According to CIP rules, we look for the first point of difference moving away from the chiral center. In the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a **C**arbon (`-O-C...`). In the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a **H**ydrogen (`-O-H`). Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **The unanimous and correct priority order is:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (Highest):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (Lowest):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A and Determine Starting Material A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm** (the original Priority 1 group) to a primary alcohol. The acid arm (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original Priority 1 group has become lower in priority than the original Priority 2 group. This swap in the ranks of the top two groups causes a formal **inversion** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For the reaction `(S)-starting material → (R)-product`, an inversion pathway is required. Therefore, starting material **A must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B and Determine Starting Material B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm** (the original Priority 2 group) to a primary alcohol. The ester arm (Priority 1) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original Priority 1 group remains the highest priority group. Therefore, the priority order is **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For the reaction `(S)-starting material → (S)-product`, a retention pathway is required. Therefore, starting material **B must also be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nBased on a complete analysis of both reaction pathways, which is consistently supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis conclusion must be matched to the provided options:\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nC) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a thorough review of the provided candidate answers, a consistent and correct line of reasoning emerges.

All provided candidate answers correctly identify and follow the same logical pathway, even if clerical errors led to different final letter choices. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity\nThe first step is to determine which functional group each reagent will reduce. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The reagent is `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride). This reagent is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted.\n*   **Reaction B:** The reagent is `BH₃` (Borane). This reagent shows the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters largely unreacted.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Misidentifying the selectivity of the reagents is a fatal error. `LiBH₄` for esters, `BH₃` for carboxylic acids is the key distinction.\n\n### Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities for the Starting Material\nThis is the most critical and complex part of the problem. The R/S designation of the chiral center (C3) depends on the priority of the four groups attached to it. While the reaction doesn't break bonds at the chiral center, it modifies the groups, which can change their priority and thus flip the R/S label.\n\n*   The four groups on the chiral carbon (C3) are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\")\n*   To rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom from the chiral center. The first point of difference is in the final part of the carbonyl functional group: the acid has an `O-H` bond, while the ester has an `O-C` bond (to the isobutyl group).\n*   Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the **ester arm has a higher priority** than the acid arm.\n*   The correct priority order for the starting material is:\n    *   **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Correctly assigning the initial priorities is essential. The `O-C` bond in the ester outranks the `O-H` bond in the acid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group**, which was the original Priority 1 group. The acid group (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** The ester arm is converted into a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The original acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than this new alcohol arm.\n*   **Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has become a lower-priority group, and the group that was originally Priority 2 has become the new highest-priority group. This **swapping of the top two priorities** results in an **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** To get an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid group**, which was the original Priority 2 group.

The relative priority ordering of the main arms is **preserved**. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** To get an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The core concept is that swapping priorities causes inversion of the R/S label, while preserving priorities leads to retention.\n\n### Final Determination\nBased on the unanimous chemical reasoning from the analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying chemical principles, here is a step-by-step resolution of the problem.\n\n### **1. Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThe solution hinges on two key concepts in organic chemistry, which all candidate answers correctly identified:\n\n*   **Chemoselectivity of Reducing Agents**: Different reducing agents preferentially react with specific functional groups.\n    *   **Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`)**: A relatively mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and ketones but is unreactive towards carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n    *   **Borane (`BH₃`)**: A powerful reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids over esters.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules)**: While the reactions do not break bonds directly at the chiral center (preserving its 3D arrangement), they modify the attached functional groups. This can alter the priority ranking of these groups, potentially causing the R/S designation to be inverted or retained.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway**: `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the **ester group** (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is unchanged and ultimately forms the carbonyl of the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence**: To determine the change in stereochemistry, we must compare the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center's main chain *before* and *after* the reaction.\n    *   **Before Reaction**: The \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`). This is because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.\n    *   **After Reaction**: The ester arm is converted to an alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`), which is now *lower* in priority than the untouched acid arm.\n    *   **Result**: The priority of the two main substituent arms is swapped. This swap in CIP priority results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an R product).\n*   **Conclusion for A**: Since the product is **(R)** and the reaction proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway**: `BH₃` selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid group** (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is unchanged and ultimately forms the carbonyl of the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence**:\n    *   **Before Reaction**: As established, the ester arm has a higher priority than the acid arm.\n    *   **After Reaction**: The acid arm is converted to an alcohol arm, which is still lower in priority than the untouched ester arm.\n    *   **Result**: The priority ranking of the two main substituent arms is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an S product).\n*   **Conclusion for B**: Since the product is **(S)** and the reaction proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material to achieve the specified products:\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nMatching this outcome to the given options:\nA) A = (R)..., B = (R)...\nB) A = (S)..., B = (R)...\nC) A = (S)..., B = (S)...\nD) A = (R)..., B = (S)...\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving both the specific reactivity of different reducing agents (chemoselectivity) and the stereochemical consequences determined by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. A review of the candidate answers indicates a strong consensus on the underlying chemical principles.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity:**\n    The first step is to determine which functional group each reagent will reduce on the starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two relevant groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   **Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a chemoselective reagent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not readily react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   **Reaction B (`B + BH₃`)**: Borane (`BH₃`) has the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids but reacts more slowly with esters. Therefore, `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n2.  **Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities:**\n    This is the most critical step to determine the stereochemical outcome. We must rank the four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) of the starting material.\n    *   The groups are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n    *   The lowest priority is clearly `-H` (Priority 4). The `-CH₂CH₃` group has a lower priority than the two arms containing carbonyl groups.\n    *   The deciding comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. According to CIP rules, we find the first point of difference moving out from the chiral center. Following the chains to the final oxygen atom, the acid has an `O-H` bond, while the ester has an `O-C` bond (to the isobutyl group). Since Carbon (atomic number 6) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (atomic number 1), the **ester arm has higher priority** than the acid arm.\n    *   **The correct CIP priority order is:**\n        1.  (Highest) `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        4.  (Lowest) `-H`\n\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction A:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`\n    *   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm** (Priority 1) into a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has been transformed into a group with a lower priority than the original Priority 2 group. The priority rankings of the top two groups have been **swapped**. A swap of any two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To produce an **(R)** product via a reaction pathway that causes inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction B:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`\n    *   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm** (Priority 2) into a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm (Priority 1) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is **preserved**. This results in a **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To produce an **(S)** product via a reaction pathway that causes retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nThe detailed analysis consistently shows:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "This organic chemistry problem requires a detailed, two-part analysis. First, we must understand the specific reactivity of the two reducing agents (chemoselectivity). Second, we must analyze the stereochemical consequences of these reactions using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. All provided candidate answers have correctly identified these core principles, leading to a strong consensus on the chemical reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two reducible functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). The two reducing agents have opposite selectivities.\n\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids untouched.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, readily reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted under these conditions.\n\n*Careful Point 1:* Correctly identifying this differing chemoselectivity is the essential first step. Confusing the two reagents would lead to an incorrect conclusion.\n\n#### Step 2: Assign Initial Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities\nThe stereochemical outcome depends on how the reaction changes the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3). We must first establish the initial priorities.\n\n*   **Groups at the Chiral Center**:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  The \"acid arm\": `-CH₂COOH`\n    4.  The \"ester arm\": `-CH₂COOiBu`\n*   **Priority Ranking**: To rank the acid and ester arms, we follow the CIP rules and look for the first point of difference. The chain is `C3 -> CH₂ -> C=O`. Attached to the carbonyl carbon in the acid arm is an `-OH` group. In the ester arm, it's an `-O-iBu` group. The first difference is comparing the `H` from the hydroxyl group with the `C` from the isobutyl group. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the **ester arm has higher priority**.\n*   **The initial priority order is**:\n    *   **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n*Careful Point 2:* Correctly assigning these initial priorities is critical. An error here would invalidate the entire stereochemical analysis.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm** (Priority 1) to a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm (Priority 2) is unaffected.\n*   **Change in Priorities**: After the reaction, the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) is now higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Result**: The group that was originally Priority 1 has become lower in priority than the group that was originally Priority 2. This **swapping** of the top two priorities results in a formal **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation**: `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm** (Priority 2) to a primary alcohol arm. The ester arm (Priority 1) is unaffected.\n*   **Change in Priorities**: The unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Result**: The group that was originally Priority 1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority ordering is **preserved**. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n*Careful Point 3:* The key takeaway is understanding that a swap in the top CIP-ranked groups causes a formal inversion of the stereocenter's label (S becomes R, R becomes S), while preservation of the ranking leads to retention (S remains S, R remains R).\n\n### Final Determination\n\nThe detailed analysis consistently shows:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nC) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

All of the candidate answers have correctly identified the key principles, which can be synthesized into a single, definitive logical path.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nFirst, we must determine which functional group each reducing agent reacts with. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two relevant groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted. Therefore, in reaction A, the ester group is reduced.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters largely unreacted under these conditions. Therefore, in reaction B, the carboxylic acid group is reduced.\n\n**2. Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis**\n\nThis step is the most crucial for determining the stereochemical outcome. While the reactions do not break any bonds *at* the chiral center, they modify the groups attached to the carbon chain, which can change their CIP priority and potentially invert the R/S label.\n\n*   **Assigning Initial Priorities:** The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups. We must rank them:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  The arm containing the acid: `-CH₂COOH`\n    4.  The arm containing the ester: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\n    The key comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. We follow the chains from the chiral center until we find a point of difference. For the ester, the chain includes `-C(=O)-O-`**`C`**`H₂-`... whereas for the acid, it is `-C(=O)-O-`**`H`**. Since a Carbon atom has a higher atomic number than a Hydrogen atom, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n\n    The correct priority order is:\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n**3. Analyzing the Outcome of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: The ester group (original **P1**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original **P2**) is untouched.\n*   **Priority Change**: In the resulting intermediate, we now compare the untouched acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group now has higher priority.\n*   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was P1 is now lower priority than the group that was P2. The priority order of the top two groups is **swapped**. A swap in priorities causes an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Outcome of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: The acid group (original **P2**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original **P1**) is untouched.\n*   **Priority Change**: We now compare the untouched ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group remains the higher priority group.\n*   **Stereochemical Result**: The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is **maintained**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nThe analysis from every step consistently leads to the same conclusion:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the one where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is an advanced organic chemistry problem that requires a detailed, two-part analysis. An examination of the provided candidate answers shows a remarkable consistency in their underlying chemical reasoning. The correct conclusion can be reached by synthesizing their consensus logic.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe first step is to understand what each reagent does. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids untouched. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n*   **Reaction B (`B + BH₃`)**: Borane (`BH₃`) exhibits the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted. This is also correctly identified by all candidates.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Analysis via Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical and decisive part of the analysis. While the actual 3D configuration of the chiral center is preserved, its R/S *designation* can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the attached groups.\n\n*   **Part 2a: Assigning Initial CIP Priorities**\n    The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To assign priority, the acid arm and ester arm must be compared. Following the chain from C3, the first point of difference is the atom bonded to the carboxyl/alkoxy oxygen. In the ester arm, the oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom (`-O-C...`). In the acid arm, the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom (`-O-H`). Since Carbon (atomic number 6) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (atomic number 1), the ester arm receives higher priority. All candidate answers agree on this ranking.\n\n    The correct priority order is:\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n*   **Part 2b: Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n    *   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`\n    *   **Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the ester arm (the highest priority group, P1) into a primary alcohol. The acid arm (P2) is unaffected.\n    *   **Change in Priority**: In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid, the untouched acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Conclusion**: The group that was originally P1 becomes lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. This **swapping** of the top two priorities causes an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation. Therefore, to obtain the **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Part 2c: Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n    *   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`\n    *   **Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the acid arm (P2) into a primary alcohol. The ester arm (P1) is unaffected.\n    *   **Change in Priority**: In the resulting 5-hydroxy ester, the untouched ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The priority ranking of the two main arms is preserved (P1 remains the highest priority group). This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation. Therefore, to obtain the **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning from all candidate answers leads to a single conclusion:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the choice where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer. Matching this conclusion to the provided options:\n\nA) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nB) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nC) A = (R)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nD) A = (S)-acid, B = (S)-acid\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the provided answers, there is a clear consensus on the underlying chemical principles. The variation in the final lettered choices from the agents appears to stem from randomized multiple-choice options, but the core reasoning is unanimous and sound.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity\nThis step determines which functional group on the starting material is reduced in each reaction.\n*   **Starting Material**: The compound, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) group.\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities for the Starting Material\nThis is the most critical step to determine the stereochemical outcome. We must establish the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3).\n*   The four groups are: -H (hydrogen), -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n*   To rank the acid arm versus the ester arm, we look for the first point of difference along the chains. For the ester arm, the alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom (`-O-C...`). For the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom (`-O-H`).\n*   According to CIP rules, Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen. Therefore, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **The initial priority order is:**\n    1.  **P1 (Highest):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    2.  **P2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  **P4 (Lowest):** `-H`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: The **ester arm (P1)** is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **acid arm (P2)** is untouched. The resulting molecule cyclizes to the lactone, with the carbonyl coming from the acid group.\n*   **Priority Change**: In the resulting intermediate, the untouched acid arm is now higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original P1 group has been transformed into a group that is lower in priority than the original P2 group. Therefore, the priorities of the top two groups have been **swapped**.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion**: A swap in the priorities of two groups results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation. To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: The **acid arm (P2)** is reduced to a primary alcohol. The **ester arm (P1)** is untouched. The resulting molecule cyclizes to the lactone, with the carbonyl coming from the ester group.\n*   **Priority Change**: The untouched ester arm (P1) is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The priority ordering of the two main arms is preserved.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion**: Since the relative priority of the highest-ranked groups is maintained, the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation. To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nThe detailed analysis concludes that:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nLooking at the provided options:\nA) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nB) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nC) A = (S)-acid , B = (S)-acid\nD) A = (R)-acid , B = (R)-acid\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a multi-step chemical analysis, which can be broken down into several careful points. An examination of the provided candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the underlying chemical principles. The final correct answer is derived from this consistent logic.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis & Careful Points**\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity:** The first step is to understand what each reducing agent does. The starting material has both an ester and a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent that reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol while leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester group intact.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Analysis via Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules:** This is the most critical part of the problem. While the physical 3D arrangement of groups around the chiral center is preserved, the *R/S designation* can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the groups.\n\n    *   **Assigning Initial Priorities:** The chiral carbon (C3) is attached to four groups. We must rank their priority:\n        1. `-H` (Hydrogen)\n        2. `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        3. `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n        4. `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n        The crucial comparison is between the acid and ester arms. Looking at the first point of difference, the oxygen in the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-`**C**`...`) is bonded to a Carbon atom. The oxygen in the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-`**H**) is bonded to a Hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm receives the higher priority.\n\n        The correct initial priority order is:\n        **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu` > **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH` > **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃` > **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n**3. Tracing Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`**\n    *   **Transformation:** The `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group**, which was the original Priority 1 group. The carboxylic acid group (Priority 2) is unaffected.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate, the untouched carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has become a lower priority group than the group that was originally Priority 2. This swapping of the top two priorities causes an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation. To produce an **(R)**-lactone via inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Tracing Reaction B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`**\n    *   **Transformation:** The `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group**, which was the original Priority 2 group. The ester group (Priority 1) is unaffected.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxy ester intermediate, the untouched ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is still a higher priority group than the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The priority ordering of the top two groups is maintained (the original Priority 1 group is still Priority 1). This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation. To produce an **(S)**-lactone via retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the consistent analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a complex organic stereochemistry problem that requires a rigorous step-by-step analysis. An examination of the candidate answers reveals a remarkable consensus on the core chemical reasoning, with discrepancies in the final letter choices arising only from differently ordered multiple-choice options. The correct logical pathway is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**\n*   **Starting Material**: The problem uses stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is bifunctional, containing both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at the C3 carbon.\n*   **Reagents**:\n    *   **Reaction A uses LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**: This reagent is known for its chemoselectivity. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not readily reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction B uses BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted under the same conditions.\n\n**2. Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\nThis is the most critical step, as it determines how the chemical transformation affects the R/S stereochemical label. The absolute 3D configuration at the chiral center is preserved, but the label can change if the group priorities are altered.\n\n*   The four groups attached to the chiral C3 center are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), a chain containing the carboxylic acid (`-CH₂COOH`, the \"acid arm\"), and a chain containing the ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`, the \"ester arm\").\n*   To rank the acid and ester arms, we follow the CIP rules and look for the first point of difference.\n    *   Ester arm: `-CH₂-CO-O-`**C**`H₂-...`\n    *   Acid arm: `-CH₂-CO-O-`**H**\n*   The ester's oxygen is attached to a carbon atom, while the acid's oxygen is attached to a hydrogen atom. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   The unanimous and correct priority order is:\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1)**: `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2)**: `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3)**: `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4)**: `-H`\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unaffected and goes on to form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n*   **Priority Change**: In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate, the untouched acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group. The group that was originally P1 is now lower in priority than the group that was originally P2.\n*   **Result**: The priority ranking of the top two groups is **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds via inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected and forms the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n*   **Priority Change**: In the resulting 5-hydroxy ester intermediate, the untouched ester group (P1) is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol group (from the reduction of P2).\n*   **Result**: The priority order of the two main arms is **preserved**. The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds via retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Final Determination**\n\nBased on a thorough and consistent analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nTherefore, both reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires a detailed analysis of two reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the stereochemical consequences determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. A systematic breakdown is the most effective approach.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity**\nThe first step is to determine which functional group each reducing agent will react with on the starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`).\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The reagent is `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride). It is a chemoselective agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, in reaction A, the **ester group is reduced**.\n*   **Reaction B:** The reagent is `BH₃` (Borane). It exhibits the opposite selectivity, readily reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted. Therefore, in reaction B, the **carboxylic acid group is reduced**.\n\nIn both cases, the resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-carbonyl compound that cyclizes under acidic workup (H+) to form the final lactone product.\n\n**2. Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Assignment**\nThis step is critical for determining the stereochemical outcome. Even though the bonds at the chiral center (C3) are not broken, the reaction can change the chemical nature of the attached groups, which may alter their CIP priority and thus change the R/S designation.\n\n*   The four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   To rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom from the chiral center. The first point of difference is at the oxygen of the carboxyl/ester functionality. In the acid arm (`-O-H`), this oxygen is bonded to a Hydrogen. In the ester arm (`-O-iBu`), it is bonded to a Carbon. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n*   **Initial Priority Order:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n**3. Stereochemical Analysis of Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **ester arm (P1)** is reduced to a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **acid arm (P2)** is unaffected.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting molecule, the acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally P1 is now lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A swap in priorities results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**4. Stereochemical Analysis of Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **acid arm (P2)** is reduced to a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **ester arm (P1)** is unaffected.\n*   **Priority Change:** The untouched ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The original highest-priority group (P1) remains the highest-priority group. The relative priority order is **maintained**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\nThe chemical analysis concludes that both starting materials must have the same stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of two separate reactions, focusing on two key aspects of organic chemistry: the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the reactions as determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers is remarkably consistent and provides a clear path to the correct solution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis consolidating the unanimous reasoning:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThis step determines which functional group on the starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, reacts in each case.\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a reagent that selectively reduces the **ester** functional group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is left untouched.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity. It reduces the **carboxylic acid** functional group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group (`-COOiBu`) untouched.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step to determine the stereochemical outcome. While the 3D configuration of the chiral center does not change, the R/S label can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituent groups.\n*   **The Chiral Center:** The chiral carbon is C3.\n*   **Attached Groups:** It is attached to `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   **Priority Ranking:** To rank the two main arms, we look at the first point of difference from the chiral center. In the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a carbon (`-O-C...`). In the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen (`-O-H`). Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n\nThe established priority order is:\n*   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n*   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n*   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n*   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H` (Hydrogen)\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **ester group (P1)** is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, the unchanged acid arm now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The group that was originally P1 is now lower in priority than the group that was originally P2.\n*   **Result:** The priority of the top two groups is **swapped**. This swap results in a formal **inversion** of the stereochemical designation (e.g., an S reactant becomes an R product).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain an **(R)** product via this inversion pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The **acid group (P2)** is reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, the unchanged ester arm (P1) is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Result:** The relative priority order of the two main arms is **preserved**. This results in a formal **retention** of the stereochemical designation (e.g., an S reactant becomes an S product).\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain an **(S)** product via this retention pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the consistent analysis from all steps, both reactions must start with the same stereoisomer:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result matches option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires a detailed analysis of both reagent selectivity and the resulting stereochemistry. A step-by-step breakdown based on the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers is as follows.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\nThe first step is to understand what each reducing agent does. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols. It is not strong enough to reduce the carboxylic acid group under these conditions.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity. It preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters largely unreacted.\n\n**2. Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\nThis step is critical for determining the stereochemical outcome. We must rank the priority of the four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) of the starting material.\n*   The groups are: -H (Hydrogen), -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n*   To rank the acid arm versus the ester arm, we look for the first point of difference. For the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom (of the isobutyl group): `–O–C`. For the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom: `–O–H`.\n*   Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   The final priority ranking for the starting material is:\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A: A → (R)-Lactone**\n*   **Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (P1) to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priority**: In the resulting intermediate, we must compare the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm now has higher priority.\n*   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 has become lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority of the top two groups is swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain an **(R)** product from a reaction that causes inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B: B → (S)-Lactone**\n*   **Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the acid group (P2) to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priority**: We compare the unchanged ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm is still higher in priority.\n*   **Stereochemical Result**: The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is preserved. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nThe analysis shows that both starting materials must have the same configuration:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B in the provided question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a detailed, step-by-step analysis of two distinct chemical reactions. The solution relies on two key concepts in organic chemistry: the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences determined by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The reasoning provided by all candidate answers is remarkably consistent, confirming a single logical pathway to the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThe first step is to determine which functional group each reagent will reduce on the starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄)**: Lithium borohydride is a reagent known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols, leaving carboxylic acids intact under these reaction conditions.\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters unreacted.\n\n**2. Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Assignment**\n\nThis step is crucial for determining the stereochemical outcome. While the 3D structure at the chiral center is preserved, the R/S *label* can change if the reaction alters the priority of the attached groups.\n\n*   **Chiral Center (C3) Groups**: The four groups attached are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   **Priority Ranking**: To rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom from the chiral center. The point of difference is found in the final part of the functional group: the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon (`-O-C...`), while the acid's oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen (`-O-H`). Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm receives higher priority.\n*   **The unanimous priority order is**: `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`\n\n**3. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation**: The **ester arm** (the group with the highest priority) is reduced to a primary alcohol. The acid arm (the second-highest priority group) is untouched.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence**: After the reaction, the unchanged acid arm now has a higher CIP priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original highest-priority group has become lower in priority than the original second-highest group. This **swapping** of the top two priorities results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion**: For starting material **A** to form an **(R)** product through a reaction that causes inversion, A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**4. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation**: The **acid arm** (the group with the second-highest priority) is reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester arm (the highest priority group) is untouched.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence**: The ester arm remains the highest priority group, while the newly formed alcohol arm is still of lower priority. The priority order of the two main arms is **preserved**. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion**: For starting material **B** to form an **(S)** product through a reaction that proceeds with retention, B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nThe detailed analysis consistently leads to the following conclusion, which is supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers:\n\n*   Starting Material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two separate organic reactions, focusing on two key aspects:\n1.  **Chemoselectivity**: Which functional group each reducing agent preferentially attacks.\n2.  **Stereochemistry**: How the chemical transformation affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) designation of the single chiral center.\n\nAll of the provided candidate answers correctly identify and follow these two main analytical steps. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the multiple-choice options being shuffled, but the underlying chemical reasoning is sound and consistent across all answers. Here is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step 1: Reagent Chemoselectivity\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, possesses two reducible functional groups: an ester (`-COOiBu`) and a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The two reagents have opposite selectivities.\n\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reagent that reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol while leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing the **carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester untouched.\n\n### Step 2: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis\n\nThis is the most critical step. The absolute 3D arrangement of groups at the chiral center is preserved in both reactions. However, the *R/S* label can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center's carbon chain.\n\n*   **Initial Priority Assignment**: We must assign priorities to the four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) of the starting material.\n    1.  The \"ester arm\": `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    2.  The \"acid arm\": `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  The ethyl group: `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  The hydrogen atom: `-H`\n\n    To compare the ester and acid arms, we find the first point of difference along the chains. The ester's alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a Carbon atom (`-O-`**C**), while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a Hydrogen atom (`-O-`**H**). Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm receives a higher priority.\n\n    *   **The correct priority order is:**\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (**P1**) is reduced to an alcohol. The acid group (**P2**) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has become a lower priority group than the group that was originally Priority 2. This swapping of the top two priorities results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For a starting material `A` to produce an **(R)**-lactone through a reaction that causes inversion, `A` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (**P2**) is reduced to an alcohol. The ester group (**P1**) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxy ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The priority order of the top two groups is preserved (the original P1 group remains P1). This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For a starting material `B` to produce an **(S)**-lactone through a reaction that proceeds with retention, `B` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding that the two reducing agents, `LiBH₄` and `BH₃`, target different functional groups within the same starting molecule.\n*   **Starting Material:** The base molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which contains both an **ester** group (`-COOiBu`) and a **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`).\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome depends on whether the chemical reaction changes the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3). This determines if the R/S label is retained or inverted.\n\n*   **Groups at the Chiral Center (C3):**\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   **Priority Comparison:** The crucial comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. According to CIP rules, we look for the first point of difference moving away from the chiral center. In the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a **C**arbon (`-O-C...`). In the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a **H**ydrogen (`-O-H`). Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **The unanimous and correct priority order is:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (Highest):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (Lowest):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A and Determine Starting Material A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm** (the original Priority 1 group) to a primary alcohol. The acid arm (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original Priority 1 group has become lower in priority than the original Priority 2 group. This swap in the ranks of the top two groups causes a formal **inversion** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For the reaction `(S)-starting material → (R)-product`, an inversion pathway is required. Therefore, starting material **A must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B and Determine Starting Material B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm** (the original Priority 2 group) to a primary alcohol. The ester arm (Priority 1) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original Priority 1 group remains the highest priority group. Therefore, the priority order is **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For the reaction `(S)-starting material → (S)-product`, a retention pathway is required. Therefore, starting material **B must also be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nBased on a complete analysis of both reaction pathways, which is consistently supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis conclusion must be matched to the provided options:\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nC) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a thorough review of the provided candidate answers, a consistent and correct line of reasoning emerges. All analyses correctly identify the two key chemical principles required to solve this problem: the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the reactions determined by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Reagent Chemoselectivity:**\n\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: All answers correctly state that Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective agent that reduces the **ester** functional group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: All answers correctly state that Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing the **carboxylic acid** functional group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester group untouched.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Analysis (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules):**\n\nThis is the decisive part of the problem. While the physical 3D arrangement of groups around the chiral center is preserved, the R/S *designation* can change if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the substituents.\n\n*   **Initial Priorities of the Starting Material**: There is universal agreement on the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3):\n    *   The groups are: -H, Ethyl (`-CH₂CH₃`), an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n    *   The ester arm (`-O-`**C**`...`) has higher priority than the acid arm (`-O-`**H**`) because Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n    *   **The correct priority order is:**\n        1.  (P1): `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        2.  (P2): `-CH₂COOH`\n        3.  (P3): `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  (P4): `-H`\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction A (`A → (R)-lactone`)**:\n    *   `LiBH₄` reduces the ester arm (the original **P1** group). The acid arm (the original **P2** group) is untouched.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate, the untouched acid arm now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n    *   Therefore, the priority of the top two groups is **swapped**. This results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   To get an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction B (`B → (S)-lactone`)**:\n    *   `BH₃` reduces the acid arm (the original **P2** group). The ester arm (the original **P1** group) is untouched.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate, the untouched ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n    *   Therefore, the priority of the top two groups is **preserved**. This results in a **retention** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   To get an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous chemical analysis, consistently applied across all candidate answers, leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option stating that both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving both the specific reactivity of different reducing agents (chemoselectivity) and the stereochemical consequences of the reactions as determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. All provided candidate answers correctly identify and follow the same logical pathway, even if clerical errors led to different final letter choices. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity\nThe first step is to determine which functional group each reagent will reduce. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The reagent is `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride). This reagent is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted.\n*   **Reaction B:** The reagent is `BH₃` (Borane). This reagent shows the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters largely unreacted.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Misidentifying the selectivity of the reagents is a fatal error. `LiBH₄` for esters, `BH₃` for carboxylic acids is the key distinction.\n\n### Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities for the Starting Material\nThis is the most critical and complex part of the problem. The R/S designation of the chiral center (C3) depends on the priority of the four groups attached to it. While the reaction doesn't break bonds at the chiral center, it modifies the groups, which can change their priority and thus flip the R/S label.\n\n*   The four groups on the chiral carbon (C3) are:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\")\n*   To rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom from the chiral center. The first point of difference is in the final part of the carbonyl functional group: the acid has an `O-H` bond, while the ester has an `O-C` bond (to the isobutyl group).\n*   Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the **ester arm has a higher priority** than the acid arm.\n*   The correct priority order for the starting material is:\n    *   **Priority 1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4:** `-H`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Correctly assigning the initial priorities is essential. The `O-C` bond in the ester outranks the `O-H` bond in the acid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group**, which was the original Priority 1 group. The acid group (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** The ester arm is converted into a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The original acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than this new alcohol arm.\n*   **Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has become a lower-priority group, and the group that was originally Priority 2 has become the new highest-priority group. This **swapping of the top two priorities** results in an **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** To get an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid group**, which was the original Priority 2 group. The ester group (Priority 1) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** The ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged and is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (which came from the acid).\n*   **Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority ordering of the main arms is **preserved**. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** To get an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The core concept is that swapping priorities causes inversion of the R/S label, while preserving priorities leads to retention.\n\n### Final Determination\nBased on the unanimous chemical reasoning from the analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying chemical principles, here is a step-by-step resolution of the problem.\n\n### **1. Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThe solution hinges on two key concepts in organic chemistry, which all candidate answers correctly identified:\n\n*   **Chemoselectivity of Reducing Agents**: Different reducing agents preferentially react with specific functional groups.\n    *   **Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`)**: A relatively mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and ketones but is unreactive towards carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n    *   **Borane (`BH₃`)**: A powerful reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids over esters.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules)**: While the reactions do not break bonds directly at the chiral center (preserving its 3D arrangement), they modify the attached functional groups. This can alter the priority ranking of these groups, potentially causing the R/S designation to be inverted or retained.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway**: `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the **ester group** (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is unchanged and ultimately forms the carbonyl of the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence**: To determine the change in stereochemistry, we must compare the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center's main chain *before* and *after* the reaction.\n    *   **Before Reaction**: The \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`). This is because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.\n    *   **After Reaction**: The ester arm is converted to an alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`), which is now *lower* in priority than the untouched acid arm.\n    *   **Result**: The priority of the two main substituent arms is swapped. This swap in CIP priority results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an R product).\n*   **Conclusion for A**: Since the product is **(R)** and the reaction proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway**: `BH₃` selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid group** (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is unchanged and ultimately forms the carbonyl of the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence**:\n    *   **Before Reaction**: As established, the ester arm has a higher priority than the acid arm.\n    *   **After Reaction**: The acid arm is converted to an alcohol arm, which is still lower in priority than the untouched ester arm.\n    *   **Result**: The priority ranking of the two main substituent arms is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation (an S starting material becomes an S product).\n*   **Conclusion for B**: Since the product is **(S)** and the reaction proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material to achieve the specified products:\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nMatching this outcome to the given options:\nA) A = (R)..., B = (R)...\nB) A = (S)..., B = (R)...\nC) A = (S)..., B = (S)...\nD) A = (R)..., B = (S)...\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis involving both the specific reactivity of different reducing agents (chemoselectivity) and the stereochemical consequences determined by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. A review of the candidate answers indicates a strong consensus on the underlying chemical principles.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity:**\n    The first step is to determine which functional group each reagent will reduce on the starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two relevant groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   **Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a chemoselective reagent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not readily react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group.\n    *   **Reaction B (`B + BH₃`)**: Borane (`BH₃`) has the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids but reacts more slowly with esters. Therefore, `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n2.  **Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities:**\n    This is the most critical step to determine the stereochemical outcome. We must rank the four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) of the starting material.\n    *   The groups are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n    *   The lowest priority is clearly `-H` (Priority 4). The `-CH₂CH₃` group has a lower priority than the two arms containing carbonyl groups.\n    *   The deciding comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. According to CIP rules, we find the first point of difference moving out from the chiral center. Following the chains to the final oxygen atom, the acid has an `O-H` bond, while the ester has an `O-C` bond (to the isobutyl group). Since Carbon (atomic number 6) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (atomic number 1), the **ester arm has higher priority** than the acid arm.\n    *   **The correct CIP priority order is:**\n        1.  (Highest) `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        4.  (Lowest) `-H`\n\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction A:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`\n    *   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm** (Priority 1) into a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has been transformed into a group with a lower priority than the original Priority 2 group. The priority rankings of the top two groups have been **swapped**. A swap of any two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To produce an **(R)** product via a reaction pathway that causes inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction B:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`\n    *   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm** (Priority 2) into a primary alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm (Priority 1) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally Priority 1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is **preserved**. This results in a **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To produce an **(S)** product via a reaction pathway that causes retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nThe detailed analysis consistently shows:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
