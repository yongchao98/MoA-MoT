Identification of the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, an aryl halide with an isotopic label. The reagents are sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃), which is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are the classic sign of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination – Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base, abstracting a proton or a deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Non-Equivalent Ortho Positions.** This is the crucial starting point. The substrate, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two chemically distinct ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6:** Contains a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Multiple Elimination Pathways.** Because there are two different atoms to abstract, and the question asks for all *possible* products, both elimination pathways must be considered. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ creates a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ creates a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this pathway. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition – Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry of the Intermediates.** The number of products formed from this step depends on the symmetry of each benzyne intermediate.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Unsymmetrical):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons in the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two structurally distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Symmetrical):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation:\n        3.  **Aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of All Possible Products**\nTo determine the total number of possible organic products, we collect all the unique molecules generated from all possible pathways.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Count only unique products.**\n    1.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown with all the crucial points highlighted.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂).\n*   **Mechanism**: These specific conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism is characterized by the formation of a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: It is crucial to recognize that this is a benzyne-mediated reaction and not another type of substitution, such as SₙAr, which would require different reaction conditions (e.g., strong electron-withdrawing groups on the ring). All candidate answers correctly identified this mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of All Possible Intermediates (The Elimination Step)**\n*   The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base, abstracting a proton (H⁺) or a deuteron (D⁺) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identify all non-equivalent ortho positions.** The key to this problem is noticing that the starting material has two chemically distinct ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a normal hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point 3: Consider all possible reaction pathways.** Because the question asks for all *possible* products, both elimination pathways must be considered. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H⁺ from C6, followed by the loss of Br⁻, creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is preserved. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D⁺ from C2, followed by the loss of Br⁻, creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this pathway. This intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on Each Intermediate (The Addition Step)**\n*   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Assess the symmetry of each intermediate to determine the number of products.**\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne:** This intermediate is **unsymmetrical**. Nucleophilic attack at the two different carbons of the triple bond (C1 and C6) leads to two distinct products after protonation by the solvent: **2-deuteroaniline** and **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne:** This intermediate is **symmetrical**. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation: **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Tally of Unique Products**\n*   To find the total number of possible organic products, we collect all the distinct molecules generated from all pathways.\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n*   Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemical analysis is unambiguous and consistently leads to the formation of 3 distinct products.

Here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The reaction involves an isotopically labeled aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH₂ in liquid NH₃).\n*   **Mechanism**: These are the classic conditions for an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as **benzyne**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the correct mechanism.** It is crucial to identify this pathway, as other mechanisms like SₙAr are not favorable under these conditions. All candidate answers correctly identify the benzyne mechanism as the operative pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Elimination Step: Formation of Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins when the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base, removing a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying all possible elimination sites.** This is the most critical aspect of this problem. The starting material has two chemically distinct ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6**: Has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**: Has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both elimination pathways must be considered. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: Removal of the proton from C6, followed by loss of the bromide ion, forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: Removal of the deuteron from C2, followed by loss of the bromide ion, forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step. The resulting intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Addition Step: Formation of Products**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Accounting for the symmetry of each intermediate.** The number of products formed from each intermediate depends directly on its symmetry.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (unsymmetrical)**: Because this intermediate is unsymmetrical, nucleophilic attack on the two different carbons of the triple bond (C1 and C6) leads to two distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (symmetrical)**: Because this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no isotopic label, attack at either carbon of the triple bond results in a single, identical product:\n        3.  **Aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nBy collecting all the unique products generated from every possible reaction pathway, we find a total of three structurally distinct organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are **3** possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning confirms that three distinct organic products can be formed. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 1\nB) 4\nC) 2\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the correct answer. The reasoning is synthesized from the unanimous chemical logic presented in the candidate answers.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, an aryl halide with an isotopic label. The reagents are sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃), which is an exceptionally strong base.\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive, short-lived intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Elimination Step: Formation of All Possible Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins when the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base, abstracting a proton (or its isotope, a deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Distinct Ortho Positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two chemically distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6**: Holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**: Holds a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: All Possible Pathways.** Because these positions are different, and the question asks for all *possible* organic products, we must consider that the base can abstract from either position. This leads to two separate pathways and the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes H⁺ from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost from the molecule in this pathway. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Addition Step: Nucleophilic Attack on Each Intermediate**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Role of Intermediate Symmetry.** The number of products formed from each intermediate depends directly on its symmetry.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (unsymmetrical)**: This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Therefore, nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from Benzyne (symmetrical)**: This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium label. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation.\n        3.  The single product is **aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nBy collecting all the unique organic products from all possible reaction pathways, we have a total of three structurally distinct molecules:\n1.

Identification of the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, an aryl halide with an isotopic label. The reagents are sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃), which is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are the classic sign of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination – Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base, abstracting a proton or a deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Non-Equivalent Ortho Positions.** This is the crucial starting point. The substrate, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two chemically distinct ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6:** Contains a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Multiple Elimination Pathways.** Because there are two different atoms to abstract, and the question asks for all *possible* products, both elimination pathways must be considered. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ creates a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ creates a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this pathway. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition – Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry of the Intermediates.** The number of products formed from this step depends on the symmetry of each benzyne intermediate.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Unsymmetrical):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons in the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two structurally distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Symmetrical):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation:\n        3.  **Aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of All Possible Products**\nTo determine the total number of possible organic products, we collect all the unique molecules generated from all possible pathways.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Count only unique products.**\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nThe total count of structurally distinct organic products is **3**.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown with all the crucial points highlighted.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂).\n*   **Mechanism**: These specific conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism is characterized by the formation of a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: It is crucial to recognize that this is a benzyne-mediated reaction and not another type of substitution, such as SₙAr, which would require different reaction conditions (e.g., strong electron-withdrawing groups on the ring). All candidate answers correctly identified this mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of All Possible Intermediates (The Elimination Step)**\n*   The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base, abstracting a proton (H⁺) or a deuteron (D⁺) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identify all non-equivalent ortho positions.** The key to this problem is noticing that the starting material has two chemically distinct ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a normal hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point 3: Consider all possible reaction pathways.** Because the question asks for all *possible* products, both elimination pathways must be considered. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H⁺ from C6, followed by the loss of Br⁻, creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is preserved. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D⁺ from C2, followed by the loss of Br⁻, creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this pathway. This intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on Each Intermediate (The Addition Step)**\n*   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Assess the symmetry of each intermediate to determine the number of products.**\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne:** This intermediate is **unsymmetrical**. Nucleophilic attack at the two different carbons of the triple bond (C1 and C6) leads to two distinct products after protonation by the solvent: **2-deuteroaniline** and **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne:** This intermediate is **symmetrical**. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation: **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Tally of Unique Products**\n*   To find the total number of possible organic products, we collect all the distinct molecules generated from all pathways.\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n*   Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemical analysis is unambiguous and consistently leads to the formation of 3 distinct products.

This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Abstraction of the proton from C6, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, creates a triple bond between C1 and C6.

Here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The reaction involves an isotopically labeled aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH₂ in liquid NH₃).\n*   **Mechanism**: These are the classic conditions for an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as **benzyne**.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the correct mechanism.** It is crucial to identify this pathway, as other mechanisms like SₙAr are not favorable under these conditions. All candidate answers correctly identify the benzyne mechanism as the operative pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Elimination Step: Formation of Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins when the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base, removing a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying all possible elimination sites.** This is the most critical aspect of this problem. The starting material has two chemically distinct ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6**: Has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**: Has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both elimination pathways must be considered. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: Removal of the proton from C6, followed by loss of the bromide ion, forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: Removal of the deuteron from C2, followed by loss of the bromide ion, forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step. The resulting intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Addition Step: Formation of Products**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Accounting for the symmetry of each intermediate.** The number of products formed from each intermediate depends directly on its symmetry.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (unsymmetrical)**: Because this intermediate is unsymmetrical, nucleophilic attack on the two different carbons of the triple bond (C1 and C6) leads to two distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (symmetrical)**: Because this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no isotopic label, attack at either carbon of the triple bond results in a single, identical product:\n        3.  **Aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nBy collecting all the unique products generated from every possible reaction pathway, we find a total of three structurally distinct organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are **3** possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning confirms that three distinct organic products can be formed.

The reasoning is synthesized from the unanimous chemical logic presented in the candidate answers.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, an aryl halide with an isotopic label. The reagents are sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃), which is an exceptionally strong base.\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive, short-lived intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Elimination Step: Formation of All Possible Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins when the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base, abstracting a proton (or its isotope, a deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Distinct Ortho Positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two chemically distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6**: Holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**: Holds a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: All Possible Pathways.** Because these positions are different, and the question asks for all *possible* organic products, we must consider that the base can abstract from either position. This leads to two separate pathways and the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes H⁺ from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost from the molecule in this pathway. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Addition Step: Nucleophilic Attack on Each Intermediate**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Role of Intermediate Symmetry.** The number of products formed from each intermediate depends directly on its symmetry.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (unsymmetrical)**: This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Therefore, nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from Benzyne (symmetrical)**: This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium label. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation.\n        3.  The single product is **aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nBy collecting all the unique organic products from all possible reaction pathways, we have a total of three structurally distinct molecules:\n1.
