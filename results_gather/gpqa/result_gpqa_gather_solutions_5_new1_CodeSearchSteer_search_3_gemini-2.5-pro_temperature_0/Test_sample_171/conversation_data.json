This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels.\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states, `j` (higher energy) and `i` (lower energy):\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n        (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n        (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann equations from step 3 into the relationship from step 4:\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both sides since we are considering the same transition in the same type of atom (iron). We can cancel it out:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to get ln(2) on one side:\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n9.  **Factor and combine terms:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k` and find a common denominator for the temperature terms:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Let's calculate the pre-factor:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n    Note that the problem is cleverly designed so this factor simplifies to 1.\n\n11. **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation from step 9:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n12. **Compare with the options:** This final equation matches option B.\n\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nC) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\nThe correct equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate given the assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (a higher state `j` and a lower state `i`):\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j` and `N_i` are the populations of the energy levels `j` and `i`.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the ratio of populations (the \"excitation\") as `R = N_j / N_i`. We can write the equation for each star:\n\n1.  **For star 1 (temperature T_1):**\n    R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n2.  **For star 2 (temperature T_2):**\n    R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, so `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R_1 and R_2:\n\n(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is a property of the iron atom and cancels out from both sides:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The value of the Boltzmann constant `k` is also `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation:\n\n1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to a lower state (`N_i`) is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g` represents the statistical weights of the levels, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars:** We can write this equation for each star:\n    *   Star 1: `(N_j / N_i)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   Star 2: `(N_j / N_i)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    (Here, `C` is the constant ratio of statistical weights `g_j / g_i`).\n\n3.  **Using the Problem's Condition:** We are told that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means:\n    `(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations:**\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    The constant `C` cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n5.  **Solving for Temperature:** To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    Using logarithm rules, this simplifies to:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    Rearranging the terms to solve for `ln(2)`:\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Using the Given Values:** The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. This means the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** Substituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1` into our equation gives the final relationship:\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n    This matches option D.\n\nThe following Python code will print the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks to identify the correct equation relating the temperatures\n# of two stars, T_1 and T_2, based on the excitation of iron atoms.\n\n# Step 1: Define the relationship from the problem statement.\n# The excitation ratio in star 1 is twice that in star 2.\n# Let R be the excitation ratio (N_excited / N_lower_state).\n# R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n# Step 2: Use the Boltzmann equation for the excitation ratio R.\n# R = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T)), where C is a constant (g_j/g_i).\n# For star 1: R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n# For star 2: R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Step 3: Substitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship from Step 1.\n# C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n# The constant C cancels out.\n# exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Step 4: Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2 by taking the natural log.\n# ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))\n# -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))\n# -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n# Step 5: Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2).\n# ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\n# Step 6: Use the given physical constants.\n# ΔE is given as approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n# The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n# Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n\n# Step 7: Substitute this value into the equation.\n# ln(2) = 1 * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n# ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n# Step 8: Compare this result with the given options.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\",\n    \"B\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\",\n    \"C\": \"ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\",\n    \"D\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\"\n}\n\n# The derived equation matches option D.\ncorrect_option = \"D\"\n\nprint(\"The derivation leads to the equation: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is: {options[correct_option]}\")\nprint(\"<<<D>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The derivation leads to the equation: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\nThis corresponds to option D.\nThe correct choice is: ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n<<<D>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the governing physical principle.**\nThe problem describes the population of atoms in different energy levels within the photospheres of stars. It explicitly mentions the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This situation is described by the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Write down the Boltzmann Equation.**\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level 1):\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited and lower states, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The problem does not provide the statistical weights (g₁ and g₂). In such cases, it is standard to assume that their ratio (g₂/g₁) is 1, or that it is the same for both stars and thus cancels out in the comparison. We will proceed with the assumption that g₂/g₁ = 1.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star.**\nLet R be the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state (R = N₂/N₁).\n*   For star_1 with temperature T₁:\n    R₁ = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n*   For star_2 with temperature T₂:\n    R₂ = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**Step 4: Use the relationship given in the problem.**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio of populations for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2.\nR₁ = 2 * R₂\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 3:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**Step 5: Solve the equation for the relationship between T₁ and T₂.**\nTo solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(eˣ) = x:\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate the ln(2) term:\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T₂) - (1 / T₁) ]\n\nFind a common denominator for the terms in the brackets:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ / (T₁*T₂)) - (T₂ / (T₁*T₂)) ]\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The derived equation contains the term (ΔE / k). The options provided do not have this term. This implies that the value of this term must be 1. We must check this using the values given in the problem.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the value of the (ΔE / k) term.**\nThe problem gives:\n*   Energy difference, ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nCalculate the ratio:\n(ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nThe numerical value of the pre-factor is exactly 1.\n\n**Step 7: Substitute the value back into the equation.**\nSubstitute (ΔE / k) = 1 into the equation from Step 5:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n**Step 8: Compare the final result with the given options.**\nThe derived equation is ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]. This matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the population of different energy levels and temperature is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i` (`N_i`) is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(- (E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state (`N_j / N_i`) is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    Let `R(T) = N_j / N_i` be the excitation ratio at a given temperature `T`.\n    The problem gives us:\n    `R(T_1) = 2 * R(T_2)`\n    Where `T_1` is the temperature of star_1 and `T_2` is the temperature of star_2.\n\n4.  **Set up the equation using the Boltzmann formula:**\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n7.  **Rearrange the equation:** We want to find an expression for `ln(2)`, so we rearrange the terms:\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n8.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n9.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem states that the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately `1.38 x 10^-23 J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K`.\n    Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    So, the constant of proportionality `(ΔE / k)` is approximately `1 K`.\n\n10. **Final form of the equation:** Substituting this value back into our derived equation gives:\n    `ln(2) ≈ (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n    B) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]`\n    C) `ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]`\n    D) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n\n    Our derived relationship has the functional form `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`. This matches option D. Although the equation in option D is dimensionally inconsistent (a dimensionless number `ln(2)` is equated to a term with units of `1/Temperature`), it is the only option that correctly represents the physical relationship derived from the Boltzmann equation. It is likely that the constant factor `ΔE/k ≈ 1 K` was omitted for simplicity in the problem's options.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning behind the derivation is sound and confirmed by the search results.

Understand the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states. For an excited state 'j' and a lower energy state 'i', the ratio of their populations (N_j / N_i) at a temperature T is given by:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in states j and i, respectively.\n*   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E_j - E_i = ΔE is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe term (N_j / N_i) represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms to the level j relative to level i.\n\n**2.

This means the population ratio R₁ is twice the population ratio R₂:\n    R₁ = 2 * R₂\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equation:**\n    Substitute the expressions for R₁ and R₂ into the relationship:\n    (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    Since we are considering the same transition in iron for both stars, the energy difference ΔE and the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) are the same. We can cancel the (g₂/g₁) term from both sides:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  **Solving for the Relationship between T₁ and T₂:**\n    To solve for T₁ and T₂, we first take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n5.  **Using the Given Numerical Values:**\n    The problem provides the energy difference:\n    ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n    The Boltzmann constant, a fundamental constant in physics, is:\n    k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    Let's calculate the ratio (ΔE / k).

I am confident in this answer.\n\nTo determine which of the provided equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in various energy levels under conditions of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N_2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (N_1) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n    where:\n    *   `g₁` and `g₂` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars**: We are given two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively. The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This is interpreted as the ratio of populations (N₂/N₁) in star_1 being twice that in star_2.\n\n    For star_1 (temperature T_1):\n    (N₂ / N₁)_₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)\n\n    For star_2 (temperature T_2):\n    (N₂ / N₁)_₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n3.  **Setting up the Relationship**: According to the problem statement:\n    (N₂ / N₁)_₁ = 2 * (N₂ / N₁)_₂\n\n    Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n    (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n\n    The statistical weight ratio (g₂ / g₁) is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n    exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To isolate the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₁)] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n    -ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n    -ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) - ΔE / kT₂\n\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n    ΔE / kT₂ - ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2)\n\n    Factoring out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Combining the terms in the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)] = ln(2)\n\n5.  **Using the Given Values**: The problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.

Understand the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem involves the \"excitation\" of atoms in stellar photospheres. The assumption that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is crucial. This assumption allows us to use the **Boltzmann Equation** to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels as a function of temperature.\n\n**2. State the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_e`) to the number of atoms in a ground energy state (`N_g`):\n\n`N_e / N_g = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_e`, `N_g`: Number of atoms in the excited and ground states, respectively.\n*   `g_e`, `g_g`: Statistical weights (degeneracies) of the excited and ground states. This ratio `(g_e / g_g)` is a constant for a specific atomic transition.\n*   `ΔE`: The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n*   `k`: The Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T`: The temperature in Kelvin.\n*   `exp()`: The exponential function, e^x.\n\nThe term `N_e / N_g` represents the level of excitation.\n\n**3.

Therefore, we can cancel it from both sides of the equation.\n\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**6. Solve for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2**\n\nTo solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides.\n\n`ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(exp(x)) = x`, we get:\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)` on one side:\n\n`ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`(ΔE / k) * [ 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 ] = ln(2)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the brackets by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n`(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n**7.

This allows us to use the Boltzmann distribution to describe how atoms are distributed among their various energy states.\n\n2.  **Write Down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms ($N_b$) in a higher energy state 'b' to the number of atoms ($N_a$) in a lower energy state 'a'.\n\n    $N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T))$\n\n    Where:\n    *   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the statistical weights of the energy levels (constants for a given transition).\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Each Star:** We need to write this equation for both star_1 (with temperature $T_1$) and star_2 (with temperature $T_2$). Let's call the ratio of populations ($N_b / N_a$) for star_1 as $R_1$ and for star_2 as $R_2$. Since we are observing the same energy levels of iron in both stars, the values for $g_b$, $g_a$, and $\\Delta E$ are identical in both cases.\n\n    *   For star_1: $R_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))$\n    *   For star_2: $R_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Observational Data:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n\n    $R_1 = 2 * R_2$\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the expressions for $R_1$ and $R_2$ into this relationship:\n\n    $(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\n6.  **Simplify the Combined Equation:**\n    *   The term with the statistical weights, $(g_b / g_a)$, is present on both sides and can be canceled out.\n        $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation.\n        $ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\n    *   Using the properties of logarithms, $ln(e^x) = x$ and $ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$:\n        $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n        $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_2)$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the $ln(2)$ term:\n        $\\Delta E / (k * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2)$\n\n    *   Factor out the common term, $\\Delta E / k$:\n        $(\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)$\n\n    *   Find a common denominator for the terms in the parentheses:\n        $(\\Delta E / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)$\n\n7.  **Use the Provided Numerical Values:** The problem gives the energy difference as $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J. The Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.

The Boltzmann constant, `k`, has a defined value of exactly `1.380649 × 10^(-23) J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1`, the equation simplifies to:\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nMy derivation was correct. The search results confirm that the Boltzmann equation is the correct tool to use for relating atomic excitation to temperature in a stellar photosphere under LTE. The equation is given as N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (kT)). My step-by-step derivation based on the ratio of this equation for two different stars is sound. The key step is recognizing that the given energy difference, ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J, is numerically equal to the standard value of the Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. This implies that the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1, which simplifies the final expression. This kind of setup is common in physics problems to make the final answer tidy and dependent only on the variables of interest.\n\nFinal check of the derivation:\n1.  Ratio for star 1: (N₂/N₁)_₁ = C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)]\n2.  Ratio for star 2: (N₂/N₁)_₂ = C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n    (where C = g₂/g₁)\n3.  Given: (N₂/N₁)_₁ = 2 * (N₂/N₁)_₂\n4.  Substitute: C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n5.  Cancel C: exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n6.  Take natural log: -ΔE / (kT₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (kT₂)\n7.  Rearrange: ln(2) = ΔE / (kT₂) - ΔE / (kT₁)\n8.  Factor out ΔE/k: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [1/T₂ - 1/T₁]\n9.  Simplify the fraction: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)]\n10. Given ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J and knowing k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K, we have ΔE/k ≈ 1.\n11. Final equation: ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option B. The physics is consistent: for the excitation to be higher in star_1, it must be hotter, so T₁ > T₂, making the right side of the equation positive, which matches the left side, ln(2).\n\nThe relationship between spectral features and temperature is well-established. Higher temperatures lead to more energetic collisions, which can excite atoms to higher energy levels. The Boltzmann equation quantitatively describes this relationship between the population of energy levels and temperature.\n\nTherefore, the derivation is sound and confirmed by fundamental principles of stellar atmospheres.\n\nThe correct equation is ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]. This corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThe correct relationship between the temperatures of the two stars is derived from the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy states in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_excited`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_ground`) is given by:\n\n    `N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    *   `g` is the statistical weight or degeneracy of the energy level.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars**: We can write this equation for each star. Let `C` represent the constant ratio of statistical weights `(g_excited / g_ground)`.\n\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T₁): `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = C * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)`\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T₂): `(N_excited / N_ground)₂ = C * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)`\n\n3.  **Using the Problem's Condition**: The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the population ratio in star_1 is double that in star_2:\n\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)₂`\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations**: Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:\n\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]`\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out:\n\n    `exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₁)] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]`\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n\n    `-ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) - ΔE / kT₂`\n\n    Rearranging the terms to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / kT₂) - (ΔE / kT₁)`\n\n6.  **Simplifying the Expression**: Factor out the common term `ΔE/k`:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1/T₂) - (1/T₁) ]`\n\n    Find a common denominator for the terms in the bracket:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n7.  **Substituting the Given Values**: The problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. This specific choice of value for `ΔE` is intended to simplify the equation, making the ratio `ΔE / k` approximately equal to 1 K.\n\n    Substituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1` into the equation gives:\n\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n    This simplifies to the final correct relationship:\n\n    `ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\nThis result matches option D. It also makes physical sense: for ln(2) to be positive, T₁ must be greater than T₂, which is consistent with the higher excitation level observed in star_1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThis problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in different energy levels when a system is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation:**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_b`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_a`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`(N_b / N_a) = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the respective energy states.\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the energy levels.

The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to apply this equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation for the ratio of atoms in an excited energy state (N_j) to a lower energy state (N_i) is:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant, which has a defined value of 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\nLet's denote the excitation level (the ratio N_j/N_i) for star_1 and star_2. The energy level `j` is the specific excited level mentioned, and `i` is a reference lower level, typically the ground state.\n\nFor star_1, with effective temperature T_1:\n(Excitation)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\nFor star_2, with effective temperature T_2:\n(Excitation)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2.

First, rearrange the equation:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\nUsing the exponential property exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a-b):\nexp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\nexp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\nTake the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. As noted, the Boltzmann constant `k` is 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE/k` is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE/k ≈ 1` into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nFinally, we combine the terms in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe search results confirm the key physical principles used in the derivation.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Constant (k)**: The searches confirm that the value of the Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K. This is crucial as it matches the value of the energy difference (ΔE) given in the problem, making the ratio ΔE/k equal to approximately 1.\n\n2.  **Boltzmann Equation**: Several sources confirm the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of two energy levels (N_a, N_b) in a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. The equation is given as:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)).\n    This is the exact formula I used in my initial derivation. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the stellar photospheres justifies the use of this equation.\n\nThe derivation steps were:\n1.  Define the ratio of excited atoms for each star using the Boltzmann Equation. Let 'j' be the excited state and 'i' be the ground state.\n    *   For Star 1 (Temperature T₁): (N_j / N_i)₁ = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   For Star 2 (Temperature T₂): (N_j / N_i)₂ = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n2.  Use the problem statement that the excitation in star 1 is double that of star 2:\n    *   (N_j / N_i)₁ = 2 * (N_j / N_i)₂\n\n3.  Substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relation:\n    *   (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  Cancel the statistical weight term (g_j / g_i) as it's the same for both:\n    *   exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n5.  Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    *   -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n6.  Rearrange to solve for ln(2):\n    *   ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n7.  Substitute the given values. The problem states ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J, and we know k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k ≈ 1 K.\n\n8.

We can cancel it out:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to get ln(2) on one side:\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n9.  **Factor and combine terms:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k` and find a common denominator for the temperature terms:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`.

Understand the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem involves the \"excitation\" of atoms in stellar photospheres. The assumption that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is crucial. This assumption allows us to use the **Boltzmann Equation** to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels as a function of temperature.\n\n**2. State the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_e`) to the number of atoms in a ground energy state (`N_g`):\n\n`N_e / N_g = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_e`, `N_g`: Number of atoms in the excited and ground states, respectively.\n*   `g_e`, `g_g`: Statistical weights (degeneracies) of the excited and ground states. This ratio `(g_e / g_g)` is a constant for a specific atomic transition.\n*   `ΔE`: The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n*   `k`: The Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T`: The temperature in Kelvin.\n*   `exp()`: The exponential function, e^x.\n\nThe term `N_e / N_g` represents the level of excitation.\n\n**3. Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star**\n\nLet's write the equation for Star 1 (with temperature T_1) and Star 2 (with temperature T_2).\n\n*   **For Star 1:**\n    `(N_e / N_g)_1 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n*   **For Star 2:**\n    `(N_e / N_g)_2 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**4. Incorporate the Information from the Question**\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This translates mathematically to:\n\n`(N_e / N_g)_1 = 2 * (N_e / N_g)_2`\n\n**5. Combine and Simplify the Equations**\n\nNow, substitute the Boltzmann expressions from Step 3 into the relationship from Step 4:\n\n`(g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The term for the statistical weights `(g_e / g_g)` is the same for both stars because it relates to the same specific energy levels of the iron atom. Therefore, we can cancel it from both sides of the equation.\n\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**6. Solve for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2**\n\nTo solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides.\n\n`ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(exp(x)) = x`, we get:\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)` on one side:\n\n`ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`(ΔE / k) * [ 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 ] = ln(2)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the brackets by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n`(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n**7. Use the Given Numerical Values**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The problem provides specific values: `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J` and the Boltzmann constant is known to be `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. These values were deliberately chosen so that their ratio is approximately 1.\n\n`ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\nSubstitute this value `(ΔE / k = 1)` back into our equation:\n\n`1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\nThis simplifies to the final relationship:\n\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**8. Final Conclusion**\n\nThis derived equation matches option B.\n\n*   **Self-Correction/Sanity Check:** For the excitation to be higher in Star 1, its temperature `T_1` must be higher than `T_2`. If `T_1 > T_2`, then `T_1 - T_2` is a positive number. Since `ln(2)` is also positive, our equation `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)` is physically consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N_j` in an excited state `j` to the number of atoms `N_i` in a lower energy state `i`:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (`E_j - E_i`).\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:**\n    Let `R` be the ratio of the populations of the two energy levels, `R = N_j / N_i`.\n\n    *   For `star_1` with temperature `T_1`:\n        `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))`\n\n    *   For `star_2` with temperature `T_2`:\n        `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in `star_1` is twice that in `star_2`. This means:\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n5.  **Set up the equation:** Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into the relationship from step 4:\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars (since it's the same atomic transition) and can be canceled from both sides:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponents, take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to put `ln(2)` on one side:\n    `ΔE / (k_B * T_2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Factor and combine terms:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k_B`:\n    `(ΔE / k_B) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n    `(ΔE / k_B) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n10. **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k_B` is approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k_B`:\n    `ΔE / k_B ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\n    To be more precise, let's use a python script.\n    ```python\n    import scipy.constants\n\n    delta_E = 1.38e-23  # J\n    k_B = scipy.constants.k # J/K, Boltzmann constant\n\n    ratio = delta_E / k_B\n\n    print(f\"The value of the ratio ΔE / k_B is {ratio} K.\")\n    ```\n    \n11. **Finalize the equation:** Substituting the calculated value `ΔE / k_B ≈ 1` back into the equation from step 9:\n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n    `[ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n12. **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect.\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - **Correct.**\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect.\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect.\n\nThe derived equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation:\n\n1.  **Assumptions**: The problem states we can assume the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

This allows us to use the Boltzmann distribution to describe how atoms are distributed among their various energy states.\n\n2.  **Write Down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms ($N_b$) in a higher energy state 'b' to the number of atoms ($N_a$) in a lower energy state 'a'.\n\n    $N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T))$\n\n    Where:\n    *   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the statistical weights of the energy levels (constants for a given transition).\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Each Star:** We need to write this equation for both star_1 (with temperature $T_1$) and star_2 (with temperature $T_2$). Let's call the ratio of populations ($N_b / N_a$) for star_1 as $R_1$ and for star_2 as $R_2$. Since we are observing the same energy levels of iron in both stars, the values for $g_b$, $g_a$, and $\\Delta E$ are identical in both cases.\n\n    *   For star_1: $R_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))$\n    *   For star_2: $R_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Observational Data:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n\n    $R_1 = 2 * R_2$\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the expressions for $R_1$ and $R_2$ into this relationship:\n\n    $(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\n6.  **Simplify the Combined Equation:**\n    *   The term with the statistical weights, $(g_b / g_a)$, is present on both sides and can be canceled out.\n        $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation.\n        $ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\n    *   Using the properties of logarithms, $ln(e^x) = x$ and $ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$:\n        $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n        $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_2)$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the $ln(2)$ term:\n        $\\Delta E / (k * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2)$\n\n    *   Factor out the common term, $\\Delta E / k$:\n        $(\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)$\n\n    *   Find a common denominator for the terms in the parentheses:\n        $(\\Delta E / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)$\n\n7.  **Use the Provided Numerical Values:** The problem gives the energy difference as $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J. The Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.

The Boltzmann constant, `k`, has a defined value of exactly `1.380649 × 10^(-23) J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1`, the equation simplifies to:\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nMy derivation was correct. The search results confirm that the Boltzmann equation is the correct tool to use for relating atomic excitation to temperature in a stellar photosphere under LTE. The equation is given as N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (kT)). My step-by-step derivation based on the ratio of this equation for two different stars is sound. The key step is recognizing that the given energy difference, ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J, is numerically equal to the standard value of the Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. This implies that the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1, which simplifies the final expression. This kind of setup is common in physics problems to make the final answer tidy and dependent only on the variables of interest.\n\nFinal check of the derivation:\n1.  Ratio for star 1: (N₂/N₁)_₁ = C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)]\n2.  Ratio for star 2: (N₂/N₁)_₂ = C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n    (where C = g₂/g₁)\n3.  Given: (N₂/N₁)_₁ = 2 * (N₂/N₁)_₂\n4.  Substitute: C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n5.  Cancel C: exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n6.  Take natural log: -ΔE / (kT₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (kT₂)\n7.  Rearrange: ln(2) = ΔE / (kT₂) - ΔE / (kT₁)\n8.  Factor out ΔE/k: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [1/T₂ - 1/T₁]\n9.  Simplify the fraction: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)]\n10. Given ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J and knowing k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K, we have ΔE/k ≈ 1.\n11. Final equation: ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option B. The physics is consistent: for the excitation to be higher in star_1, it must be hotter, so T₁ > T₂, making the right side of the equation positive, which matches the left side, ln(2).\n\nThe relationship between spectral features and temperature is well-established. Higher temperatures lead to more energetic collisions, which can excite atoms to higher energy levels. The Boltzmann equation quantitatively describes this relationship between the population of energy levels and temperature.\n\nTherefore, the derivation is sound and confirmed by fundamental principles of stellar atmospheres.\n\nThe correct equation is ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]. This corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThe correct relationship between the temperatures of the two stars is derived from the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy states in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_excited`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_ground`) is given by:\n\n    `N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / kT)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    *   `g` is the statistical weight or degeneracy of the energy level.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars**: We can write this equation for each star. Let `C` represent the constant ratio of statistical weights `(g_excited / g_ground)`.\n\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T₁): `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = C * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)`\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T₂): `(N_excited / N_ground)₂ = C * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)`\n\n3.  **Using the Problem's Condition**: The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the population ratio in star_1 is double that in star_2:\n\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)₂`\n\n4.  **Combining the Equations**: Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:\n\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]`\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out:\n\n    `exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₁)] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]`\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n\n    `-ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) - ΔE / kT₂`\n\n    Rearranging the terms to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / kT₂) - (ΔE / kT₁)`\n\n6.  **Simplifying the Expression**: Factor out the common term `ΔE/k`:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1/T₂) - (1/T₁) ]`\n\n    Find a common denominator for the terms in the bracket:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n7.  **Substituting the Given Values**: The problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. This specific choice of value for `ΔE` is intended to simplify the equation, making the ratio `ΔE / k` approximately equal to 1 K.\n\n    Substituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1` into the equation gives:\n\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n    This simplifies to the final correct relationship:\n\n    `ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\nThis result matches option D. It also makes physical sense: for ln(2) to be positive, T₁ must be greater than T₂, which is consistent with the higher excitation level observed in star_1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThis problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in different energy levels when a system is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation:**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_b`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_a`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`(N_b / N_a) = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the respective energy states.\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the energy levels.

The key was the application of the Boltzmann equation to a ratio of two systems and the specific values provided for `ΔE` and `k`.\n\nTo answer this question, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to apply this equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation for the ratio of atoms in an excited energy state (N_j) to a lower energy state (N_i) is:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant, which has a defined value of 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\nLet's denote the excitation level (the ratio N_j/N_i) for star_1 and star_2. The energy level `j` is the specific excited level mentioned, and `i` is a reference lower level, typically the ground state.\n\nFor star_1, with effective temperature T_1:\n(Excitation)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\nFor star_2, with effective temperature T_2:\n(Excitation)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\n(Excitation)_1 = 2 * (Excitation)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_j / g_i) is identical for both stars and cancels out:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nNow, we solve for the temperatures. First, rearrange the equation:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\nUsing the exponential property exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a-b):\nexp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\nexp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\nTake the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. As noted, the Boltzmann constant `k` is 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE/k` is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE/k ≈ 1` into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nFinally, we combine the terms in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe search results confirm the key physical principles used in the derivation.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Constant (k)**: The searches confirm that the value of the Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K. This is crucial as it matches the value of the energy difference (ΔE) given in the problem, making the ratio ΔE/k equal to approximately 1.\n\n2.  **Boltzmann Equation**: Several sources confirm the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of two energy levels (N_a, N_b) in a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. The equation is given as:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)).\n    This is the exact formula I used in my initial derivation. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the stellar photospheres justifies the use of this equation.\n\nThe derivation steps were:\n1.  Define the ratio of excited atoms for each star using the Boltzmann Equation. Let 'j' be the excited state and 'i' be the ground state.\n    *   For Star 1 (Temperature T₁): (N_j / N_i)₁ = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   For Star 2 (Temperature T₂): (N_j / N_i)₂ = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n2.  Use the problem statement that the excitation in star 1 is double that of star 2:\n    *   (N_j / N_i)₁ = 2 * (N_j / N_i)₂\n\n3.  Substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relation:\n    *   (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  Cancel the statistical weight term (g_j / g_i) as it's the same for both:\n    *   exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n5.  Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    *   -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n6.  Rearrange to solve for ln(2):\n    *   ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n7.  Substitute the given values. The problem states ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J, and we know k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k ≈ 1 K.\n\n8.  The final equation is:\n    *   ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option A. The logic is sound and supported by fundamental physics principles confirmed in the search results.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nThe problem requires an application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states. For a given element in a stellar photosphere, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_b) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_a) is given by:\n\n(N_b / N_a) = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `E_b - E_a` (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited to lower-state atoms for a specific energy transition as `R`.\n\nFor Star 1, with temperature T_1:\nR_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor Star 2, with temperature T_2:\nR_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in Star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in Star 2. This means that the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state is twice as large for Star 1 compared to Star 2. Therefore:\n\nR_1 / R_2 = 2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions for R_1 and R_2:\n\n[ (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] ] / [ (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ] = 2\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g_b / g_a)` cancels out:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\nUsing the properties of exponents, this simplifies to:\n\nexp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\nexp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nNow, we combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE as approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is:\n\n(1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation gives the final result:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
