It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only α-carbon with a proton, deprotonation must occur at this position. The steric hindrance of the t-BuOK base is irrelevant for regioselectivity here, as there is no other choice.\n    *   The enolate forms with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate anion (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated during the workup to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The new group, `–CH₂CH₂COOEt`, is attached to C6.\n    *   The carbon at C6, which was tertiary, becomes a quaternary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, the new propanoate chain, C1, and C5 of the ring.\n    *   To name this product, we can treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The attachment is at the 3-position of the propanoate.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl ring for IUPAC naming: The point of attachment is C1. The principal functional group (ketone) gets the next lowest number, so the carbonyl is at C2.\n        *   The original C6 is now C1 (with a methyl group).\n        *   The original C1 (carbonyl) is now C2 (oxo group).\n        *   The original C2 is now C3 (with an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    *   The name of the substituent is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) is a nitroalkane. The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael addition** reaction. The carbanion derived from the nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nitronate Anion (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   In but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN), the β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate carbanion (α to the nitrile group) is protonated by water (H₂O).\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is formed by connecting the `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)`– unit to the `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` unit.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The nitrile carbon is C1.\n        *   The chain is `C(6)H₃–C(5)H₂–C(4)H(NO₂) –C(3)H(CH₃)–C(2)H₂–C(1)N`.\n        *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two α-carbons, C2 and C6. The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one proton. Therefore, the base will abstract the proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate anion, with the negative charge on C6, acts as the nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition that forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** The resulting product has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this compound as per the given options, the ethyl propanoate part is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is the original C6 of the ring. For naming purposes, this carbon is now C1 of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1 of the substituent.\n    *   The ketone group (=O) is on the adjacent carbon, which is C2 (the original C1 of the ketone).\n    *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is now C3 of the substituent.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. This forms a carbanion (a nitronate ion), `[CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)]⁻`, which serves as the Michael donor.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the one in the `CH₃-CH=` part of the molecule.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting acyclic structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end, we find a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem involves a step-by-step analysis of two separate organic chemistry reactions, followed by the selection of the correct option that accurately describes the major products of both.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone that can form an enolate (the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a base (t-BuOK).\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no α-hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at the less sterically hindered C6 position to form the kinetic enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6-enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product A Structure and Naming:** The resulting product is named as an ethyl propanoate derivative, where the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. According to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the principal functional groups the lowest possible locants, starting from the point of attachment. The point of attachment (original C6) becomes C1. The carbonyl group (original C1) is at C2. The ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) are at C3. The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1. This leads to the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:** The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** This carbanion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n4.  **Product B Structure and Naming:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile. To name the product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN). The chain is six carbons long (hexanenitrile). The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. The resulting name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.

This is a ketone that can be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base indicates a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The α-carbons of the ketone are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The base removes the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate). The nucleophilic carbon is C6 of the enolate.\n    *   The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group), which is the electrophilic site in a conjugate addition.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n    *   After the addition and subsequent protonation (workup), the new substituent, a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate group), is attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   The resulting molecule is `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n    *   The options provide names where the product is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. We must name the cyclohexanone part as a substituent.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (C1'). This was C6 in the original ketone.\n    *   The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1' of the substituent name.\n    *   The carbonyl group (oxo) was at C1 of the ketone, which is adjacent to C6. So, the oxo group is at C2' in the new numbering.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups were at C2 of the ketone, which is adjacent to the carbonyl C1. So, these groups are at C3' in the new numbering.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexyl ring are: a methyl at C1', an oxo at C2', and an ethyl and a methyl at C3'.\n    *   Alphabetizing and numbering gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`), which is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n    *   After the addition and protonation by water, the final product is formed by connecting the two fragments:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael addition** reaction. The reaction involves an enolate (from the ketone) acting as a nucleophile and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) acting as a Michael acceptor. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the α-hydrogen at the C6 position. This forms a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. In this case, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The enolate (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the initial addition, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during the workup step to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring structure is maintained.\n    *   The substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) are unchanged.\n    *   At C6, the original hydrogen is replaced by the ethyl acrylate-derived group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (an ethoxycarbonylethyl group).\n    *   The resulting structure is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n6.  **Name the Product A and Compare with Options:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the propanoate chain is the parent and the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. Let's re-name our product according to this convention to match the options.\n    *   The main chain is ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl group is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated as C1.\n        *   The carbon of attachment (our original C6) has a methyl group. So, we have a **1-methyl** substituent.\n        *   The carbonyl group is on the adjacent carbon (our original C1), which becomes C2 in the substituent name. So, we have a **2-oxo** group.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (our original C2) is now C3 in the substituent name. So, we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for A in options A and C. The name in options B and D, which describes a 4-oxo product, is incorrect as the Michael addition occurs at the α-carbon (C6), adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane provides the nucleophile (a carbanion), and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group.\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is the CH carbon attached to the methyl group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond connects `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` to the `CH(CH₃)` part of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Name the Product B and Compare with Options:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN).\n    *   The chain is: `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`.\n    *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B in options A and D. The name in options B and C is incorrect; it corresponds to a different molecule with a different number of carbon atoms.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given choices, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile. The ethyl acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the site of enolate formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has no α-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton, the bulky base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate this carbon to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) in a conjugate addition. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the cyclohexanone core with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and a new substituent at C6, which is an ethyl propanoate group attached via its C3.\n    *   Let's name this product. If we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3. The numbering of the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent starts at the point of attachment (C1).\n        *   The point of attachment (our original C6) is now C1 of the substituent name. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent, so it is at C2.\n        *   The quaternary carbon (original C2) is at position C3. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a nitro-Michael addition, a variation of the Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nitronate anion which is a potent nucleophile (a Michael donor). (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The nucleophilic attack will occur at the β-carbon (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the -CN group).\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        *   N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Enolate Formation**:\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It's important to correctly identify the structure and the available α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The name `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one` and `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one` refer to the same molecule, just with different numbering schemes for the carbon ring. Let's analyze the structure based on the name that clarifies the reactive site.\n    *   Using the name `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one`, the carbonyl group is at position C2. The α-carbons are C1 and C3.\n    *   C3 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the ketone at the C1 position. This removes any ambiguity about which enolate is formed.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The enolate formed at C1 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After protonation (typically from the solvent or during workup), the final product is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The resulting molecule has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C1 position of the `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl` ring.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the product A listed in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon alpha to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion. This anion then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Nucleophile Formation**:\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2`) to form the nitronate anion `[CH3-CH2-CH-NO2]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane part and C3 of the butenenitrile part.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated by water to give the final product: `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile, we have a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the product B listed in options A and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option C contains both correct products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one acidic alpha-hydrogen. Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, forming a single regioselective enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure**: After the addition and subsequent protonation (during workup), a `-CH2-CH2-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone. The product is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product according to IUPAC rules, the ester is considered the principal functional group, making the \"ethyl propanoate\" the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl substituent ring starts with C1 at the point of attachment. The ketone group should have the lowest possible number, which makes it C2.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are a methyl group at C1 (the original C6-methyl) and an ethyl and a methyl group at C3 (the original C2-substituents).\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon), which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion is a nucleophile (a Michael donor). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH3CH2CH-NO2]⁻`.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting structure after protonation by water is `CH3-CH(CH(NO2)CH2CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product, the nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group, and the carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain: `CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.

This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Enolate Formation (Deprotonation)**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-hydrogen, the base will exclusively deprotonate this position to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition)**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The nucleophile is the cyclohexanone enolate (attacking from C6).\n    *   The electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).

We have a ketone (enolate precursor), a strong bulky base (t-BuOK), and a Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n2.  **Form the nucleophile (enolate):** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton, the base will abstract this proton to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Identify the electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The enolate will attack the electrophilic β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n4.  **Perform the Michael addition:** The carbanion at C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The π bond of the acrylate shifts, and after protonation (during workup), the final product is formed.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (A):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is a cyclohexanone ring where C6 is bonded to both its original methyl group and a new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` chain.\n    *   The full structure has: C1=O, a geminal ethyl and methyl group at C2, a methyl group at C6, and the `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n6.  **Name the product (A):** The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. Let's adopt this naming convention.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring, attached at its C6 position to the C3 of the propanoate.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (old C6 is new C1').\n    *   New C1' (old C6) has a methyl group.\n    *   New C2' (old C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n    *   New C3' (old C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. We have a compound with acidic α-protons (1-nitropropane), a strong base (KOH), and a Michael acceptor ((E)-but-2-enenitrile).\n2.  **Form the nucleophile (carbanion):** The protons on the carbon adjacent (α) to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂`) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This is the nucleophile.\n3.  **Identify the electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, also known as crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor. The nucleophile will attack the electrophilic β-carbon (the `CH` group bonded to the methyl group).\n4.  **Perform the Michael addition:** The carbanion of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The π bond shifts, and the resulting intermediate is protonated by water.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (B):**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n6.  **Name the product (B):** We use IUPAC nomenclature for nitriles.\n    *   The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (`-CN`). This is a 6-carbon chain, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A is incorrect.\n*   B) B is incorrect.\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. **This option matches both of our derived products.**\n*   D) A and B are both incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n**Reaction 1: Michael Addition**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and reaction type:** The first reaction is a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone will be deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Determine the site of enolate formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the single α-hydrogen from C6. Therefore, the enolate is formed exclusively at the C6 position.\n\n3.  **Predict the product of the Michael addition:** The C6-enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate in a conjugate (1,4) addition. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety. After a protonation step, the final product **A** is formed.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the options provided, the product must be named treating the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain. The main chain is `ethyl ...propanoate`. The substituent is attached to the third carbon (C3) of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclic substituent, the ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone).\n        *   New C1 is the attachment point (original C6), which has a methyl group.\n        *   New C2 is the original C1, which bears the keto group (=O).\n        *   New C3 is the original C2, which has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the substituent is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full IUPAC name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Michael Addition of a Nitroalkane**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile:** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion), `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Predict the product of the Michael addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile. Subsequent protonation (from H₂O) yields the final product **B**.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group has six carbons (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering the chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the products of the two reactions:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction A:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   Identify the Michael donor and acceptor. The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, will be deprotonated by the strong, bulky base t-BuOK to form an enolate (the Michael donor). Ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor.\n    *   Determine the site of deprotonation on the ketone. The alpha-carbon at position 2 is quaternary and has no protons. The alpha-carbon at position 6 has one proton. The bulky base t-BuOK will abstract this proton at C6.\n    *   Trace the nucleophilic attack. The C6 of the enolate will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Determine the structure of product A and name it according to IUPAC rules.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction B:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   Identify the Michael donor and acceptor. 1-nitropropane will be deprotonated by KOH at the carbon alpha to the nitro group, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (the Michael donor). (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n    *   Trace the nucleophilic attack. The alpha-carbon of the deprotonated 1-nitropropane will attack the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Determine the structure of product B and name it according to IUPAC rules.\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Option:** Compare the derived names for products A and B with the given choices to find the correct match.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to represent the derived product names and the options, then programmatically find and print the correct option letter.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n*   **Product A:** The enolate of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one forms at C6 and adds to ethyl acrylate. This attaches a `-CH2CH2COOEt` group to C6 of the original ketone. To name this product as an ethyl propanoate derivative, the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent at the 3-position. The ring's point of attachment (old C6) is numbered as 1 for the substituent name. This leads to the name **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n*   **Product B:** The carbanion from 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH(-)NO2`) adds to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The resulting carbon chain is `CH3CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`. Numbering from the nitrile group (C1), the longest chain is a hexanenitrile. This gives the name **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can identify the correct choice among the options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the correct products for two Michael addition reactions\n    and selects the corresponding option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Analysis of Reaction A ---\n    # Reactants: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate\n    # Reagent: t-BuOK (Potassium tert-butoxide)\n    # Reaction Type: Michael Addition\n    # The enolate forms at C6 and attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    # Naming the resulting structure as a propanoate ester gives:\n    product_A_name = \"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\"\n\n    # --- Analysis of Reaction B ---\n    # Reactants: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n    # Reagents: KOH, H2O\n    # Reaction Type: Michael Addition\n    # The alpha-carbon of deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the beta-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    # Naming the resulting structure as a nitrile gives:\n    product_B_name = \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"\n\n    # --- Options provided in the problem ---\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\"),\n        \"B\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"),\n        \"C\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\"),\n        \"D\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"),\n    }\n\n    # --- Find the correct option ---\n    correct_option = None\n    for choice, (name_A, name_B) in options.items():\n        if name_A == product_A_name and name_B == product_B_name:\n            correct_option = choice\n            break\n\n    # --- Print the final answer ---\n    if correct_option:\n        print(correct_option)\n    else:\n        # This part should not be reached if the analysis is correct\n        print(\"Analysis did not match any of the given options.\")\n\nsolve_reaction_puzzle()\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: D\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Formation of Product A**\n\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone that can act as a Michael donor after being deprotonated.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The combination of these reactants points to a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has **no** α-protons.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6.

The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The main chain is `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name in options B and D: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This name implies the following structure for the cyclohexyl substituent:\n        *   The attachment to the propanoate chain is at **C1**.\n        *   C1 also has a **methyl** group.\n        *   The carbonyl (oxo) group is at **C2**.\n        *   C3 has an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Let's draw this structure:\n        ```\n               O=C2\n              /   \\\n        C1(Me, R) -- C3(Et, Me)   (where R is the -CH₂CH₂COOEt group)\n        |             |\n        C6H₂ -------- C4H₂\n         \\           /\n            C5H₂\n        ```\n    *   Comparing this structure with our predicted product, we see they are identical. The atoms are connected in the same way: `C(Et,Me)-C(=O)-C(Me,R)`. The numbering system is just different. The IUPAC naming convention for a ring as a substituent dictates that the point of attachment is C1, and other groups are numbered from there to give the lowest locants.

The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the NO₂ group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) and can be removed by a base.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base sufficient to deprotonate the nitroalkane.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is another **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Carbanion Formation**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon (C1) of 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. In `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, the β-carbon is the `CH` group next to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting nitrile-stabilized carbanion intermediate is protonated by water to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure and Name of Product B**\n    *   Let's assemble the final structure by connecting the pieces:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n        *   Combined structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile:\n        `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   C6 has one α-proton and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6.

This enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6-enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The structure is: 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provided use a different IUPAC naming convention where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    *   Parent chain: `ethyl ...propanoate`. The substituent is attached at the C3 position of the propanoate chain. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   Substituent: The cyclohexyl ring. According to IUPAC rules, the numbering of the substituent ring starts at the point of attachment.\n        *   The point of attachment is the original C6 of the ketone. This becomes **C1** in the substituent name. This C1 has a methyl group.\n        *   The adjacent carbonyl carbon (original C1) becomes **C2**. This C2 has an oxo group.\n        *   The adjacent quaternary carbon (original C2) becomes **C3**. This C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the cyclohexyl substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options B and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition** reaction (specifically, a Henry-Michael reaction).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):**\n    *   The starting nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts an acidic proton from the carbon α to the nitro group (C1).\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate ion (CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. After workup with H₂O, the intermediate enolate is protonated.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is formed by connecting the two fragments:\n        (CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂) + (CH-CH₃)-(CH₂-CN)\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The chain is 6 carbons long, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   CN is C1.\n        *   -CH₂- is C2.\n        *   -CH(CH₃)- is C3. There is a **methyl** group at C3.\n        *   -CH(NO₂)- is C4. There is a **nitro** group at C4.\n        *   -CH₂- is C5.\n        *   -CH₃ is C6.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) A = wrong, B = right\nB) A = right, B = wrong\nC) A = wrong, B = wrong\nD) A = right, B = right\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nBoth reactions presented are examples of the Michael addition, a fundamental carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction in organic chemistry. This reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (a Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound or other electron-withdrawing group (a Michael acceptor).\n\n#### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons are at positions 2 and 6. Carbon 2 has no protons as it is fully substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. Carbon 6 has one acidic proton. Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK will selectively deprotonate at the C6 position to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n4.  **Product Structure & Nomenclature**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. To name the resulting product as a propanoate ester, the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. Following IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as C1'. The numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group (the ketone's oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2'. The original substituents of the ketone are located accordingly.\n    *   **Substituent at C3 of ethyl propanoate**: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`\n    *   **Full name of Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n\n#### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: Protons on the carbon adjacent to a nitro group are acidic. KOH is a sufficiently strong base to deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂), forming a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n4.  **Product Structure & Nomenclature**: A new C-C bond is formed. The resulting acyclic product needs to be named according to IUPAC rules for nitriles. The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group (-CN) is identified as the parent chain.\n    *   **Structure**: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   **Parent chain**: The longest chain including the nitrile carbon has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   **Numbering**: The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   **Substituents**: A methyl group is at C3 and a nitro group is at C4.\n    *   **Full name of Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the mechanistic analysis of both Michael addition reactions and the application of IUPAC nomenclature rules:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis is a Michael addition reaction. The t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To form an enolate, an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) must be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with both an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 has one methyl group and one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Due to the absence of α-hydrogens at position 2, the base can only abstract the proton from position 6. This enolate is the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate formed at C-6 will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor) in a conjugate addition.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):** The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming of Product A:** To name the resulting molecule as a propanoate derivative (as given in the options), the ethyl propanoate chain is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   For naming the substituent ring, the point of attachment (the original C-6) is numbered as C-1. This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   The ketone group (original C-1) is now at position 2 of the substituent ring.\n    *   The original C-2, which has both an ethyl and a methyl group, is now at position 3 of the substituent ring.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full IUPAC name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction. The base (KOH) deprotonates the nitroalkane, which then acts as the nucleophile.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nitronate (Michael Donor):** KOH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-hydrogen from 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`) to form a stabilized carbanion known as a nitronate ion.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`), which is the Michael acceptor. The attack occurs at the carbon bearing the methyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a derivative of a nitrile. The nitrile carbon is C-1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group on C-3 and a nitro group on C-4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect A, Correct B\n*   B) Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   C) Correct A, Correct B\n*   D) Correct A, Incorrect B\n\nThe correct choice is the one that accurately identifies both products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe analysis of both reactions appears to be correct based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n**Reaction A: Michael Addition**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a bulky base.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. The base deprotonates the starting ketone to form an enolate. The only available α-proton is on carbon 6 (C6), as C2 is a quaternary carbon. The t-BuOK abstracts this proton to form the enolate at C6. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate in a conjugate addition.\n*   **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The resulting substituent at C6 is a `-(CH2)2COOEt` group.\n*   **Product Name (A):** To name the product, if we consider the propanoate as the parent chain, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3. The point of attachment on the ring is designated as C1 for naming purposes. The original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes C2, and the original C2 becomes C3. Therefore, the substituent is named (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl). The full IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options A and C.\n\n**Reaction B: Michael Addition**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Catalyst:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon adjacent to the nitro group), which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the NO2 group. The resulting nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Product Structure:** The nucleophilic carbon from 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2-CH-NO2`) bonds to the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`-CH(CH3)-`). The final structure after protonation is `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n*   **Product Name (B):** For IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) has priority and its carbon is designated as C1. The longest carbon chain containing this group has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile. The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. Thus, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches options B and C.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBoth of these products correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate then acts as a nucleophile and adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at position C1. We need to identify the α-carbons, which are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C2 and C6).\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has one α-proton.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at C6 to form the corresponding enolate. The negative charge (and the nucleophilic character) will be on C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The initial structure of the ketone is: C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -H).\n    *   After the reaction, the hydrogen at C6 is replaced by the `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group from ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting product has the following connectivity on the cyclohexane ring: C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt). C6 is now a quaternary carbon.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   We need to name the product structure: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This naming convention treats the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain and the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. The propanoate chain is attached to the ring at some position.\n    *   Let's renumber our product structure to match this naming style. The IUPAC rules for naming a substituted cycloalkane attached to a side chain can be complex, but the options guide us. The name in options C and D is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. Let's verify if our product matches this name.\n    *   Let's analyze the name:\n        *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is on C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   The substituent is a `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. The attachment to the propanoate is at C1 of the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   Let's draw the structure from this name:\n        *   The cyclohexyl ring has an attachment point at C1.\n        *   C1 also has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 has an oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Now, let's compare this to our derived product structure `[C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt)]`. We can renumber our structure:\n        *   Let Old C6 be New C1.\n        *   Let Old C1 be New C2.\n        *   Let Old C2 be New C3.\n    *   With this new numbering, the substituents are:\n        *   New C1 (was Old C6): has a methyl group and the attachment to the ethyl propanoate chain.\n        *   New C2 (was Old C1): has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (was Old C2): has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   This structure perfectly matches the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. 1-Nitroalkanes have acidic protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group). KOH is a strong base that will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane. The resulting nitronate anion is a good nucleophile. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which is a Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂).\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   The α-carbon is adjacent to the -CN group (C2), and the β-carbon is next to that (C3). Structure: C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon (C1) of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The bond formation connects the `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-` fragment to the `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment (after protonation of the intermediate enolate/nitrile anion by water).\n    *   The final structure is: **CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n    *   We identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   The chain is: **C⁶**H₃-**C⁵**H₂-**C⁴**H(NO₂)-**C³**H(CH₃)-**C²**H₂-**C¹**N.\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) A is incorrect.\nB) Both A and B are incorrect.\nC) Both A and B are correct.\nD) B is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem requires identifying the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position.

It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).\n    *   The C6 of the cyclohexanone ring forms a new carbon-carbon bond with the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring had an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    *   After the reaction, a new substituent, `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate), is attached to the C6 carbon.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring where C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product by treating the ethyl propanoate moiety as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate (`ethyl OOC-CH₂(2')-CH₂(3')`).\n    *   The substituent is attached to C3' of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring. The IUPAC rules for such complex substituents can be tricky, but the key is to match the connectivity. Let's number the ring of the substituent starting from the point of attachment as C1.

This set of reactants is characteristic of a **Michael addition**. The ketone will act as the Michael donor after being deprotonated to form an enolate, and the ethyl acrylate will act as the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone. Let's examine the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n    *   **C2 (alpha to the carbonyl):** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n    *   **C6 (alpha to the carbonyl):** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has one acidic α-proton.\n    *   Since only C6 has an α-proton, deprotonation occurs exclusively at this position to form a specific enolate. This enolate anion is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enolate (at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. Subsequent protonation during the work-up step yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and IUPAC Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone.\n    *   To name the product, we follow IUPAC rules. The ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the parent chain is based on the ester. The `...-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` fragment makes the parent name **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Now, we must name the complex substituent ring. The point of attachment to the parent chain (the original C6 of the ketone) is given the lowest possible locant, C1'. The principal functional group on the ring, the ketone (`=O`), should then receive the lowest possible number, which is C2'.\n    *   Based on this numbering:\n        *   The methyl group from the original C6 is now on C1'.\n        *   The carbonyl group is at C2' (indicated by `-oxo`).\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups from the original C2 are now on C3'.\n    *   The name of the substituent is therefore **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The complete name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This name matches the name for product A in options C and D, so we can eliminate options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, and a base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane is the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`). The protons on this carbon are acidic because the resulting carbanion (a nitronate anion, `CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂`) is stabilized by the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group through resonance.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. Protonation from water yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and IUPAC Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂) – CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long. Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end:\n        `CN(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(CH₃)(3) - CH(NO₂)(4) - CH₂(5) - CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at position C3 and a nitro group at position C4.\n    *   The complete name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This name matches the name for product B in option C. The name for B in option D (2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile) is incorrect as it describes a different molecule with a four-carbon parent chain.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBoth of these correct names are found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nAnswering based on the provided information and the executed code output.\n\n**Reasoning Confirmation:**\n\nThe step-by-step chemical analysis for both reactions has been performed.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The Michael addition between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate correctly produces **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This is because the only available acidic alpha-proton is at the C6 position, which leads to this specific constitutional isomer.\n*   **Reaction B:** The Michael addition between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile correctly produces **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**, based on the IUPAC nomenclature rules for the resulting structure.\n\nThe provided code execution output confirms this analysis:\n*   `Analysis for Product A matches Option C: True`\n*   `Analysis for Product B matches Option C: True`\n*   `Conclusion: Option C is correct.`\n\nThe code successfully mapped the derived product structures to the names provided in option C, verifying the correctness of the analysis.

The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will remove an acidic alpha-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: Ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The ketone has two alpha-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no alpha-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5) and has one acidic alpha-proton.\n    *   The t-BuOK base will abstract the only available alpha-proton from C6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The resulting enolate is a nucleophile. It will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate in a conjugate addition.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation (usually from the solvent or during workup), the final product is formed.\n\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**:\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The IUPAC naming for such a complex molecule can be approached by treating the larger cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`:\n        *   `ethyl ... propanoate`: This indicates the `CH₂CH₂COOEt` chain.\n        *   The cyclohexyl group is a substituent attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n        *   C1 (formerly C6 of the ketone) has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 (formerly C1 of the ketone) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3 (formerly C2 of the ketone) has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   This matches the name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**: This is a nitro-Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor**: 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`).

My initial step-by-step analysis of both reactions led to a specific product for each.\n\nFor Reaction A (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK), I determined the product is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This is based on the Michael addition mechanism where the only available α-proton on the C6 carbon is removed by the base to form an enolate, which then attacks the ethyl acrylate. The naming convention was confirmed by renumbering the resulting substituted cyclohexane ring, with the point of attachment being C1.\n\nFor Reaction B (1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH), I deduced the product is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This is also a Michael addition, where the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane becomes a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile. The IUPAC name was derived from the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group.\n\nThe combination of these two products, A and B, directly corresponds to option A. The google search results confirm the general principles of Michael additions for both types of nucleophiles (ketone enolates and nitroalkane anions) and acceptors (α,β-unsaturated esters and nitriles). The searches also confirm the acidity of α-protons in nitroalkanes and ketones, which is the prerequisite for the reaction. The term \"conjugate addition\" is used synonymously with Michael addition. The regioselectivity in ketone enolate formation is a key factor, and in this specific ketone, there is only one position with an α-hydrogen, making the reaction regioselective. Therefore, the initial analysis is well-supported by established chemical principles. No conflicting information was found. I am confident in my initial conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer Determination:\n- Product A: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n- Product B: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n- This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate will then attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two alpha-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon, and C3) and has no alpha-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon and has one alpha-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the carbon of ethyl acrylate that is beta to the ester group.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The addition of the ethyl acrylate fragment to C6 of the ketone results in a `-(CH₂CH₂COOEt)` chain being attached at this position.\n    *   To name the final product, the propanoate chain is considered the parent structure. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the third carbon of the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   When naming the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. The carbonyl carbon (original C1) becomes C2. The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) becomes C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The complete name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a nitro-Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane. This carbon is acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. The resulting nitronate anion is a good nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon from the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   **Nucleophile**: `CH₃-CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂`\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the beta-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

It will remove an acidic α-hydrogen from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   It has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, and two other carbons) and has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming the corresponding enolate.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate nucleophile attacks the ethyl acrylate (a Michael acceptor) at the β-carbon. This is a conjugate (or 1,4-) addition.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** The resulting product is `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`. To name this according to the format in the options (`ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`), the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent. The IUPAC rules for naming such substituents state that the point of attachment to the main chain (the propanoate) is numbered as C1 of the ring.\n    *   **New Numbering for Naming:**\n        *   The original C6 (the point of attachment) becomes the new C1.\n        *   The original C1 (the carbonyl carbon) becomes the new C2.\n        *   The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) becomes the new C3.\n    *   **Identifying Substituents with New Numbers:**\n        *   At the new C1: a methyl group.\n        *   At the new C2: an oxo group.\n        *   At the new C3: an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Arranging these alphabetically gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\nThis is also a Michael addition, specifically a nitro-Michael reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane. The protons on the carbon adjacent to a nitro group are acidic. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   The structure of but-2-enenitrile is `CH₃–CH(β)=CH(α)–CN`.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the deprotonated 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks the β-carbon.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile chain.\n    *   The resulting carbon skeleton is: `CH₃CH₂–CH(NO₂) –CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group. This is a six-carbon chain, making it a derivative of hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   Substituents are located at:\n        *   C3: a methyl group.\n        *   C4: a nitro group.\n    *   Therefore, the name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition.

This setup is characteristic of a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of deprotonation.**\nThe base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which acts as the nucleophile. The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **α-carbon at C2:** This carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon C1, and C3). It has no protons, so it cannot be deprotonated.\n*   **α-carbon at C6:** This carbon is tertiary (bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon C1, and C5). It has one acidic proton.\nTherefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. This is a crucial point determined by the structure of the starting ketone.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the electrophile and the site of attack.**\nThe electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), which is a Michael acceptor. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. For ethyl acrylate, the attack occurs at the terminal CH₂ group.\n\n**Step 4: Form the product.**\nThe enolate formed at C6 of the cyclohexanone attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate moiety. The reaction is completed by protonation (usually during workup) of the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure and name of Product A.**\n*   **Starting material:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Attachment:** The `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6.\n*   **Product structure:** The product is a cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents: an oxo group at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, a methyl group at C6, and the new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n*   **Naming the product:** The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. In this convention, the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is named C1 of the cyclohexyl ring substituent. In our product, this is the original C6.\n    *   Numbering the ring from this attachment point (C1') to give the principal functional group (ketone) the lowest possible number, the oxo group is at C2'.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (originally at C6).\n        *   An oxo group at C2' (originally the C1 carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C3' (originally at C2).\n    *   So, the cyclohexyl substituent is named (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of reaction.**\nThis reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of deprotonation.**\nThe base, KOH, deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at its α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the –NO₂ group). The α-protons of nitroalkanes are quite acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion (nitronate anion).\n*   Nucleophile: `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the electrophile and the site of attack.**\nThe electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). It is a Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon, which is the CH group adjacent to the methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Form the product.**\nThe carbanion of 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond is formed. The intermediate carbanion on the α-carbon of the nitrile is then protonated by water.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure and name of Product B.**\n*   **Nucleophile fragment:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)–`\n*   **Electrophile fragment:** `–CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n*   **Combined structure:** `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n*   **Naming the product:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (–CN), so the molecule is named as a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n        *   `C⁶H₃–C⁵H₂–C⁴H(NO₂)–C³H(CH₃)–C²H₂–C¹N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   Option A: A is wrong, B is wrong.\n*   Option B: A is wrong, B is correct.\n*   Option C: A is correct, B is wrong.\n*   Option D: A is correct, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate (Michael Donor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.

This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The carbonyl group is at C1.\n        *   α-carbon at C2: It is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has **no α-protons**.\n        *   α-carbon at C6: It is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6 to form an enolate ion with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The enolate attacks the CH₂ group of CH₂=CHCOOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Protonation (Workup):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated, typically during workup, to yield the final product.\n    *   The final structure has an ethyl propanoate side chain (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (Product A):**\n    *   The structure is 6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The options use a different IUPAC naming convention where the side chain is the parent and the ring is a substituent. Let's adopt this convention to match the options.\n        *   **Parent Chain:** ethyl propanoate. The ring is a substituent at position 3. The name will be `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n        *   **Substituent Name:** The ring is attached at its C6 position. In substituent nomenclature, this attachment point is numbered C1'. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the other functional groups the lowest possible locants.\n            *   C1' is the point of attachment (original C6). It has a methyl group.\n            *   C2' is the original C1, which bears the oxo (=O) group.\n            *   C3' is the original C2, which has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   Combining these, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate (Michael Donor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).

This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group (C1 of 1-nitropropane).\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion): CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group: CH₃-**CH**=CH-CN.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation (Workup):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (Product B):**\n    *   We need to find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon and name it as the parent alkane.\n        *   The nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group, so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n        *   The longest chain is: **C**N(1)-**C**H₂(2)-**C**H(CH₃)(3)-**C**H(NO₂)(4)-**C**H₂(5)-**C**H₃(6).\n        *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Identify and number the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group at C3.\n        *   A nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = correct, B = correct\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = correct\n\nThe only option where both products are correctly identified is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nMy initial analysis of the two reactions and the resulting products appears to be correct and consistent. The search results confirm the general principles of Michael additions.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** This is a Michael addition. The donor is the enolate of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, and the acceptor is ethyl acrylate. The strong, bulky base t-BuOK will deprotonate the ketone at the only available α-carbon with protons, which is C6. The resulting enolate will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The naming convention used in the options, where the resulting cycloalkanone is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain, is unusual for a final product name but acceptable for analysis. My structural analysis confirmed that the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` correctly describes the connectivity of the product formed.\n*   **Reaction B:** This is a nitro-Michael addition. The base KOH deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (a nitronate). This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). My step-by-step analysis of the bond formation and subsequent IUPAC naming led to the product `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. The search results confirm that Michael additions of nitroalkanes to activated alkenes like nitriles are standard reactions.\n\nCombining the results:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\nFinal check of all options:\n*   **Option A:** Correctly identifies both products A and B.\n*   **Option B:** Incorrectly identifies the structure of product A (oxo group at position 4 instead of 2). Correctly identifies product B.\n*   **Option C:** Incorrectly identifies the structure of product A (oxo group at position 4). Incorrectly identifies product B (butanenitrile instead of hexanenitrile).\n*   **Option D:** Correctly identifies product A. Incorrectly identifies product B.\n\nBased on this, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo determine the major products of the two reactions, we need to analyze each reaction mechanism, considering steric hindrance and product stability. Both reactions are examples of the Michael addition.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, where a nucleophile adds to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is an enolate, and the α,β-unsaturated compound is ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically hindered. It will deprotonate the starting ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no protons to remove.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate can only form by deprotonating C6.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate formed at C6 will act as a nucleophile and attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt). This is a conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond will form between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure A:** The resulting product will have the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) attached to the C6 carbon of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n5.  **Product Naming:** The IUPAC name given in the options can be confusing. Let's decipher the name provided in options C and D: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name treats the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The attachment point on the ring is designated C1.\n    *   Let's renumber our product according to this convention: The original C6 (the point of attack) becomes the new C1. The adjacent carbon with the ketone group (original C1) becomes C2. The next carbon (original C2) becomes C3.\n    *   With this new numbering, C1 has a methyl group and the propanoate chain attached. C2 is a ketone (=O). C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   This connectivity perfectly matches the name `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`. Thus, product A is correctly named `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nucleophile is a nitronate anion, and the acceptor is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), will deprotonate the acidic α-proton of 1-nitropropane (CH3CH2CH2NO2). The nitro group makes the protons on the adjacent carbon (C1) acidic, forming a nitronate anion `[CH3CH2CHNO2]−`.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n4.  **Product Structure B:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The structure after protonation by water is `CH3CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming:** To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is selected as the parent chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `NC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position C3 and a nitro group at position C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   Product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option C provides the correct names for both products A and B.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a breakdown of the two reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Synthesis of Product A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) as the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, t-BuOK, deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n*   **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons to be removed.\n    *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, leading to a single, specific enolate.\n*   **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n*   **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product, A, is named by treating the propanoate chain as the parent. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the third carbon of the ethyl propanoate chain. Following IUPAC naming rules:\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The substituent is attached at C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). This carbon (C1' of the substituent) has a methyl group. The original carbonyl group is now at C2' (2-oxo), and the original C2, with its ethyl and methyl groups, is at C3' (3-ethyl-3-methyl).\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Synthesis of Product B**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile), with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion. This nucleophile then attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Nucleophile Formation:** KOH removes a proton from the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂), forming the nucleophilic anion [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻.\n*   **Michael Addition:** This anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-**CH**=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n*   **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product, B, is a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile functional group is six carbons long, making it a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-**CH(NO₂)**(4)-**CH(CH₃)**(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the electrophilic Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   First, we need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring. The carbonyl group is at position C1.\n    *   The α-carbons are at C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible position for deprotonation is at C6. The bulky base, t-BuOK, will abstract the single proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate formed is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon.\n    *   It will attack the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond will form between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the initial addition, a workup step (usually involving a proton source like water, which is implicit) will protonate the intermediate to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The resulting product will have the original cyclohexanone core with its substituents, plus a new `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n    *   The structure will be a cyclohexanone ring with:\n        *   An oxo group (=O) at C1.\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C2.\n        *   A methyl group at C6.\n        *   An ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) also at C6.\n\n4.  **Product Nomenclature:**\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, the principal functional group is the ester, so the parent name is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain at position 3.\n    *   For naming the substituent ring, the point of attachment is designated as C1'. To give the other substituents the lowest possible locants, the carbonyl group (oxo) gets position C2'.\n    *   Following this numbering for the substituent:\n        *   The attachment point (original C6) is C1'. It has a methyl group (`1'-methyl`).\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (original C1) is C2' (`2'-oxo`).\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is C3' (`3'-ethyl`, `3'-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given for A in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the base and water (H₂O).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition, often called a nitro-Michael addition.\n\n1.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate). The nucleophile is `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nitronate anion acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group (`CH₃-CH=`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The structure is formed by connecting `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-` to `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n\n4.  **Product Nomenclature:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   We must find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a `methyl` group at C3 and a `nitro` group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms the thermodynamic enolate, where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate acts as a nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ carbon.\n    *   This attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The reaction is completed by a protonation step (e.g., from the solvent or a workup), which quenches the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Product Structure A**: The resulting product has the ethyl acrylate chain, which becomes a `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group, attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The skeleton of the product is:\n        ```\n             O\n            //\n          C1--C2(Et, Me)\n         /   \\\n      C6(Me, CH₂CH₂COOEt)  C3\n      |       |\n      C5------C4\n        ```\n    *   Now, we need to name this product.

Both are examples of the Michael addition reaction.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The strong base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which acts as the nucleophile (the Michael donor). This enolate will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** We must identify the acidic protons α (alpha) to the carbonyl group of the ketone.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only remove the single α-proton at the C6 position to form the enolate. There is no ambiguity in which enolate is formed.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the enolate anion attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n\n4.  **Product A Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation, a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the starting ketone. While the IUPAC names provided in the options seem to have typographical errors regarding the substituent positions, the reaction itself is straightforward. The product retains the ketone at the original position (or a tautomeric position).\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This anion is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile.

As noted, there is likely a typo in the name for A. However, the name in option B describes a \"2-oxocyclohexyl\" derivative, which is consistent with the product of a Michael addition on a cyclohexanone. The name in option C describes a \"4-oxocyclohexyl\" derivative, which is not a plausible product from this reaction.\n*   Based on the definite identification of Product B, and the greater chemical plausibility of the product type for A in option B, we select B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis problem requires predicting the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. A strong base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is used to create a nucleophile (an enolate) from the ketone. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base needs to remove a proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) to form an enolate.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (it has no hydrogen atoms attached), so it cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 is a tertiary carbon and has one hydrogen atom.\n    *   The bulky base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the C6 position to form the only possible enolate.

It has an oxo group.\n        *   The quaternary carbon (original C2) is C3.

The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) are acidic. KOH removes a proton from C1 to form the nucleophile: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Naming (Product B):** After the addition and protonation from water, the product is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. To name this molecule, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile (6 carbons including the nitrile carbon).\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1: `NC(1)−CH₂(2)−CH(CH₃)(3)−CH(NO₂)(4)−CH₂(5)−CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these names with the given options, we find that option B matches both results.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe user wants to identify the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate an alpha-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no alpha-protons. C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen). Therefore, the only available alpha-proton for deprotonation is at the C6 position.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n    *   The t-BuOK base deprotonates the ketone at C6, forming an enolate.\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After protonation (workup), the final product is formed.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The new substituent, `–CH2CH2COOCH2CH3`, is attached at C6.\n    *   To name the product as a propanoate derivative as given in the options, we identify the main chain as ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate.\n    *   The name is therefore `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). So, the attachment point is C1 of the substituent name.\n        *   The original C1 (ketone group) is now at position 2 -> `2-oxo`.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) is now at position 3 -> `3-ethyl-3-methyl`.\n        *   The original C6 (the point of attachment) also had a methyl group, which is now at position 1 -> `1-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This corresponds to product **A** in options A and D.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`). The alpha-protons (on the carbon adjacent to the NO2 group) are acidic and can be removed by a base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3CH=CHCN`), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (`CH3CH2CH⁻NO2`).\n    *   This carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water (H₂O) yields the final adduct.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH3CH2CH(NO2)–CH(CH3)CH2CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`). The IUPAC name will be a derivative of hexanenitrile because the longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `C1`: Nitrile carbon\n        *   `C2`: `-CH2-`\n        *   `C3`: `-CH(CH3)-` -> `3-methyl`\n        *   `C4`: `-CH(NO2)-` -> `4-nitro`\n        *   `C5`: `-CH2-`\n        *   `C6`: `-CH3`\n    *   The complete IUPAC name for the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This corresponds to product **B** in options A and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given options, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided chemical reactions, the major products are determined as follows:\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically bulky. It will deprotonate the starting ketone to form an enolate.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen) and has one acidic hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at the C6 position, forming an enolate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation during workup, a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product is `2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`. To name this according to the options, the propanoate chain is treated as the parent, with the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent at its C3 position. The IUPAC naming rules require numbering the substituent ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6). To give the functional groups the lowest possible numbers, the carbonyl group (oxo) becomes position 2, and the ethyl/methyl-substituted carbon becomes position 3. This leads to the name **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction, involving a nitroalkane as the nucleophile donor.\n\n1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic proton from the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate) `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). The attack occurs at the carbon bearing the methyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is `(NO₂)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. To name this, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group, which is a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)–C(2)H₂–C(3)H(CH₃)–C(4)H(NO₂)–C(5)H₂–C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\nThis is a Michael addition reaction, a type of conjugate addition.\n\n1.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will remove the most acidic proton from the ketone to form an enolate. The most acidic protons are on the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons.\n    *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK will deprotonate the C6 carbon, as this is the only available α-proton. This forms a trisubstituted enolate.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate formed acts as a nucleophile (the Michael donor). It attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After the reaction mixture is worked up (protonated), the final product is formed. The resulting structure has the ketone at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group along with the new -(CH₂CH₂COOEt) chain at C6.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Product:** Let's analyze the options provided. The structure of product **A** must match our predicted product.\n    *   The name given in options B and D is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. Although the naming convention is unusual (naming the propanoate as the parent chain), the described structure perfectly matches our derived product. If we renumber the cyclohexanone ring to fit this name (with the carbonyl as C2), then C1 would be the original C6 (now with a methyl and the propanoate side-chain attachment) and C3 would be the original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups).\n\nTherefore, product **A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This forms a nucleophilic nitronate anion (CH₃CH₂CH=NO₂⁻).\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the carbon atom of the double bond that is further from the electron-withdrawing nitrile group.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Product:** We must determine the correct IUPAC name for this structure.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the carbon of the nitrile group (C1).\n    *   Following the longest chain, we find a methyl group at position C3 and a nitro group at position C4.\n    *   Thus, the correct name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate will then act as a nucleophile and add to the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate (the nucleophile):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group), so it has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 has one methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract a proton from C6. This leads to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate. The double bond of the enolate forms between C1 and C6.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons from the acrylate's C=C double bond shift to form an ester enolate intermediate.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The ester enolate intermediate is protonated during the aqueous workup (or by the t-butanol formed in the first step) to give the final product, A.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Identify the Product A:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl acrylate chain (now -CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   Let's analyze the IUPAC name of this product. The options name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The base chain is \"ethyl ...propanoate\". The ring is attached at position 3 of the propanoate.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment is C1.\n    *   Our product structure has the following features on the ring, using the new numbering system for the name:\n        *   C1: Point of attachment to the propanoate chain; also has a methyl group (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   C2: The keto group (=O) (the original C1).\n        *   C3: An ethyl group and a methyl group (the original C2 substituents).\n    *   Combining these parts gives the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and B. The name in options C and D suggests a \"4-oxocyclohexyl\" ring, meaning the keto group is at C4 relative to the attachment point. This would be the product of a different reaction, not a standard Michael addition. Thus, options C and D are incorrect for product A.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a base that deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The resulting carbanion (nitronate anion) attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   The hydrogens on the carbon atom attached to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   KOH removes one of these α-hydrogens to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Identify the Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon of the nitrile (-CN) group.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and D.

This is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\nThis is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong and sterically hindered base. It will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate. The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons, at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons.\n    *   The carbon at C6 is secondary (bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the enolate can only be formed by deprotonating at the C6 position.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate formed at C6 acts as a nucleophile (a Michael donor). It attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor), which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. This type of conjugate addition is favored for stabilized nucleophiles like enolates.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After the reaction mixture is neutralized, the intermediate enolate is protonated to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (A):** The resulting product is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To match the naming convention in the options, the molecule is named as a propanoate derivative. In this system, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The attachment point on the ring is designated C1.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) gets the next lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   The substituents from the original ketone are located: the ethyl and methyl groups are at C3 (originally C2), and the other methyl group is at C1 (originally C6).\n    *   Thus, the correct name for the cyclohexyl substituent is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options A and B. Options C and D are incorrect as they name it a 4-oxocyclohexyl derivative.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This creates a resonance-stabilized carbanion, [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻, which will act as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** This carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. Subsequent protonation by water yields the final product. The resulting structure is CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (B):** To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has six carbons (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   This places a methyl substituent at C3 and a nitro substituent at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for product B in options B and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct product for reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct product for reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two correct products, we find that option B provides the correct names for both A and B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) --> A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (t-BuOK).\n2.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates an α-carbon of the ketone to form an enolate (the Michael donor). The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons:\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    Therefore, the enolate can only form at the C6 position.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product A Structure & Name:**\n    *   The resulting product has an `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product, we follow IUPAC rules. The ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Thus, the molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We must number the cyclohexyl ring substituent, starting with C1 at the point of attachment to the propanoate chain.\n        *   The point of attachment is the original C6 of the ketone. This is the **new C1**. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The adjacent carbonyl carbon (original C1) is the **new C2**. It has an oxo group.\n        *   The next carbon (original C2) is the **new C3**. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

It involves a nitroalkane (which has acidic α-protons), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a base (KOH).\n2.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the acidic α-proton of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN, also known as crotononitrile).\n4.  **Product B Structure & Name:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane moiety and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile moiety.\n    *   The resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   To name this product, the nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group.

This is a substituted cyclohexanone, which can act as a nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base, ideal for forming enolates.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Enolate Formation (Careful Point: Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group), at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) will unambiguously deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position. This regioselectivity is not a matter of kinetic vs. thermodynamic control; it is the only possible site for enolate formation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed has its nucleophilic character at C6.\n    *   This C6 nucleophile will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   After protonation during the workup step, the side chain `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` is attached to C6.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To compare with the options, we must name this product according to IUPAC conventions where the propanoate is the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.

The -NO₂ group makes the α-protons acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, another good Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Nucleophile Formation (Careful Point: Acidity):**\n    *   The α-protons on the carbon bearing the nitro group (C1 of 1-nitropropane) are significantly acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   KOH is a strong enough base to deprotonate this carbon, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This will be the nucleophile.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the -CN group).\n    *   The nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻` attacks the `CH` of the `CH₃-CH=` part of the nitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by the solvent (water).\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   The final product structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The chain is: `C(1)N-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so it is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the structure for B in options A and D. Options B and C describe an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Based on the analysis of the first reaction, Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options B and D.\n*   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates options B and C.\n*   The only option that correctly identifies both products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (which can form an enolate), an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at C6 to form the enolate. The steric bulk of t-BuOK favors the formation of the less substituted (kinetic) enolate, but in this case, C6 is the only option, so the regiochemistry is fixed.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`). The enolate will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of this molecule.\n    `CH₂=CH-COOEt`\n    ` β   α`\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:** The C6 of the cyclohexanone enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between these two atoms.\n    *   **Donor part:** The cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   **Acceptor part:** `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (after attack and protonation).\n    *   The new substituent, a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group, is attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n\n    The structure of product A is:\n    ```\n             O\n            //\n        C1--C2(Et, Me)\n       /    \\\n    C6(Me, CH₂CH₂COOEt)--C5\n     \\                  /\n      C4--------------C3\n    ```\n\n5.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the ester, so the parent name is based on **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone moiety is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, we number the cyclohexyl ring starting from the point of attachment as C1'.\n    *   The point of attachment (original C6) is **C1'**. It has a methyl group, so we have `1-methyl`.\n    *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent to the attachment point, so it is at **C2'**. This gives `2-oxo`.\n    *   The quaternary carbon with ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is at **C3'**. This gives `3-ethyl-3-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given for A in options A and C.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane (which is acidic at the α-carbon), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, KOH, will deprotonate the nitroalkane at the α-carbon.\n    *   The starting nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂`).\n    *   The α-carbon (C1) has two acidic protons. Deprotonation by `OH⁻` forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`\n    `     β   α`\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Bond formation: `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]` attacks `CH₃-CH(β)`.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`). The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon becomes the parent chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest chain is 6 carbons long: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for B in options A and B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The major product for Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The major product for Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the two chemical reactions, the major products have been determined.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, t-BuOK, selectively removes the only available α-proton from the C6 position of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one to form a kinetic enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The resulting product structure is named as a substituted propanoate, where the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. When naming the ring as a substituent, the numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6). Consequently, the propanoate chain and a methyl group are at C1, the oxo group is at C2 (originally C1), and the ethyl and another methyl group are at C3 (originally C2). This leads to the IUPAC name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition, sometimes referred to as a conjugate addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, creating a nitronate anion. This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). The final product is formed after protonation by water. For IUPAC naming, the main functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the carbon chain is named as a nitrile. The longest carbon chain, including the nitrile carbon, is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1. This places the methyl substituent at C3 and the nitro group at C4. Therefore, the correct name for the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBy combining the correct products for both reactions, we find that A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate and B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe problem asks for the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions. The Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (a Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor). The selection of the major product depends on factors like steric hindrance and the stability of intermediates and final products.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically bulky base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):**\n    The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The ketone has two α-positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position C6 is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen.\n    Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Conjugate Addition:**\n    The C6 of the enolate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. Subsequent protonation yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    A new substituent, an `ethyl propanoate` chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`), is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this new, more complex molecule according to IUPAC rules, the principal functional group dictates the base name. Here, the ester (`ethyl propanoate`) is named as the parent chain, and the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent.\n\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is at C1 of the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   The carbonyl group of the ketone is at the adjacent C2 position. Thus, the substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   The original substituents on the ring are renumbered according to this new scheme:\n        *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent ring (`1-methyl`).\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups on the original C2 are now on C3 of the substituent ring (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the systematic name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This rules out options A and B.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-hydrogens of nitroalkanes are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base/Solvent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H₂O).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nitronate (Michael Donor):**\n    The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n\n3.  **Conjugate Addition:**\n    The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the C3 of the butenenitrile. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    Let's trace the carbon backbone of the product:\n    *   From 1-nitropropane: `(NO₂)-CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(CN)-CH₂-CH-(CH₃)`\n    *   Connecting these at the point of attack gives: `(CN)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    To name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the highest priority functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest chain has six carbons, including the nitrile carbon. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   This places a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This rules out the `butanenitrile` product listed in options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is correctly named `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is correctly named `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the available α-protons to determine where the enolate will form.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to four other carbons) and has no protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 has one proton.\n    Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from the C6 position. This means the enolate will form with the double bond between C1 and C6. The regiochemistry is not in question.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a conjugate addition (1,4-addition). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting product is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one with an `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n5.  **IUPAC Naming**: According to IUPAC rules, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Thus, the molecule is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexyl group is attached to carbon 3 of this chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we start numbering from the point of attachment. Thus, the original C6 of the ketone ring is now C1 for the substituent name.\n    *   Following the ring from this new C1:\n        *   C1 has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 is the carbonyl carbon (`=O`), so we have a `2-oxo` group.\n        *   C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base KOH deprotonates the 1-nitropropane, and the resulting nucleophile attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon). KOH removes one of these protons to form a nitronate anion, `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`, which serves as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Electrophile**: The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as (E)-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), which is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the C1 of nitropropane and the C3 of the butenenitrile.\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**: After the attack and subsequent protonation by water, the resulting molecule is:\n    `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so it is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   A methyl group is on C3 (`3-methyl`).\n    *   A nitro group is on C4 (`4-nitro`).\n    *   The complete IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n\n**1.

This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which will act as the electrophile.\n*   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n*   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n**2. Enolate Formation:**\n*   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group): C2 and C6.\n*   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n*   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n*   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-carbon, which is C6. This forms an enolate where the C=C double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 carbon becomes the nucleophilic center.\n\n**3. Michael Addition Step:**\n*   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. In ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt), the β-carbon is the CH2 group.\n*   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n*   The initial adduct is an enolate, which is then protonated during workup to yield the final product.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n*   **Starting Ketone:**\n    *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n    *   C2: Ethyl and methyl groups\n    *   C6: Methyl group\n*   **Product Structure:** A `–CH2CH2COOEt` group (from ethyl acrylate) is now attached to the C6 position of the ketone.\n    *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n    *   C2: Ethyl and methyl groups\n    *   C6: Methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`)\n*   **Naming:** Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The options use a naming system where the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's examine the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name implies that the main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The `cyclohexyl` group is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   The numbering of the `cyclohexyl` substituent starts from the point of attachment (C1).\n        *   C1 is attached to the propanoate chain and has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 has an oxo group (=O).\n        *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Let's see if the ketone that would form this product matches our starting material. To find the starting ketone, we remove the `–CH2CH2COOEt` group from C1 of the substituent and replace it with a hydrogen. The starting ketone would be `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexane`.\n    *   To get the standard IUPAC name for this ketone, we must number the ring to give the carbonyl group the lowest possible number (position 1).\n        *   The old C2 (with =O) becomes the new C1.\n        *   The old C1 becomes the new C6 (it has a methyl group).\n        *   The old C3 becomes the new C2 (it has an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    *   The IUPAC name of this starting ketone is **2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**, which perfectly matches the reactant given in the question.\n    *   Therefore, the structure described by `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` is the correct product A. The other name for product A, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, would originate from a different starting ketone and is incorrect.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n**1. Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH3CH2CH2NO2). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the NO2 group) are acidic.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also called crotononitrile, CH3CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n*   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n**2. Nitronate Formation:**\n*   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n*   Nucleophile: `[CH3CH2CH-NO2]`\n\n**3. Michael Addition Step:**\n*   The α,β-unsaturated system in but-2-enenitrile is `CH3(β)-CH=CH(α)-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the carbon of the CH group bonded to the methyl group).\n*   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n*   Let's connect the fragments:\n    `[CH3CH2-CH(NO2)]–[CH(CH3)-CH2-CN]`\n*   The resulting structure is: `CH3CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n*   To name this molecule using IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN), which has the highest priority.\n    1.  The nitrile carbon is C1.\n    2.  The longest chain is 6 carbons long: `N≡C(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    3.  The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    4.  The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n*   Arranging the substituents alphabetically, the final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n*   Let's check the other name for B in the options: `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. This molecule would have a total of 6 carbon atoms (butane chain=4C, +2 methyl groups=2C). The reaction between a C3 compound (1-nitropropane) and a C4 compound (but-2-enenitrile) must result in a product with C3 + C4 = 7 carbon atoms. Our derived product, 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile, has 7 carbons (hexane chain=6C, +1 methyl group=1C). Therefore, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile` is incorrect due to the carbon count alone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of the first reaction (A) is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of the second reaction (B) is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Synthesis of Product A**\n\n*   **Reactants and Reagents:** The reaction is a Michael addition between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) as the base.\n*   **Identifying the Nucleophile:** The base, t-BuOK, is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at its α-carbon to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   It has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one α-hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the base must abstract the only available α-hydrogen from the C6 position.\n*   **The Michael Addition:** The enolate formed acts as the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (H₂C=CH−COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Structure of Product A:**\n    1.  The starting ring has a C=O at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    2.  The Michael addition adds a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate chain) to the C6 position.\n    3.  This makes C6 a quaternary carbon, now bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and the new propanoate chain.\n*   **Naming Product A:** The options provided name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    1.  The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    2.  The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    3.  To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as position 1.\n        *   Position 1 (original C6) has a **methyl** group.\n        *   Position 2 (original C1) has the carbonyl (**oxo**) group.\n        *   Position 3 (original C2) has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    4.  Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    5.  Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the structure of A in options A and D.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Synthesis of Product B**\n\n*   **Reactants and Reagents:** This is a Michael addition between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the base in water.\n*   **Identifying the Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group). This forms a nitronate anion, which is a potent carbon nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`\n*   **The Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n*   **Structure of Product B:**\n    1.  A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane component and the β-carbon of the nitrile component.\n    2.  The resulting molecule's backbone is formed by linking these two parts: `(from nitropropane part) CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - (from nitrile part) CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   **Naming Product B:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority and determines the numbering of the parent chain.\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is a 6-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    2.  We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    3.  The substituents on this chain are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    4.  Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the structure of B in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option A correctly identifies both products.\n\nA) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nB) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nC) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\nD) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for determining the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition. A strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) will create an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (α-carbons) are C2 and C6. We must check for acidic α-protons on these carbons.\n    *   **α-Carbon at C2:** This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl, an ethyl group, and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no attached hydrogen atoms. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   **α-Carbon at C6:** This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl, a methyl group, and a single hydrogen atom. This hydrogen is an acidic α-proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The strong, bulky base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6, leading to the formation of a single, specific enolate ion where C6 is the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`). The β-carbon is the one furthest from the ester group in the C=C double bond.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon single bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the `CH₂` group) of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   After the reaction and subsequent protonation (workup), the ethyl acrylate part becomes a saturated `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` group.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` side chain attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   The options name the product as a derivative of `ethyl propanoate`, meaning the `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` fragment is the parent chain. The entire cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   Let's name this complex substituent according to IUPAC rules. The ring carbon attached to the parent chain (the original C6) is numbered as position 1 of the substituent.\n        *   **Position 1 (original C6):** Has a `methyl` group attached.\n        *   **Position 2 (original C1):** Contains the carbonyl, so it's an `oxo` group.\n        *   **Position 3 (original C2):** Contains an `ethyl` group and a `methyl` group.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent gives **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   This substituent is located on carbon 3 of the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is another Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the nitroalkane to create a nucleophile, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂–NO₂`). The protons on the carbon directly bonded to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, removes an α-proton to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CH–NO₂]⁻`. The α-carbon acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃–CH=CH–CN`).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting molecular skeleton is `(CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂))–(CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)`.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   To name the final product, `CH₃–CH₂–CH(NO₂) –CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN`, we follow IUPAC nomenclature.\n    *   The nitrile (`–CN`) group is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1 and the name will end in `-nitrile`.\n    *   The longest continuous carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. The parent alkane is hexane, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1) to locate the substituents:\n        *   A **methyl** group (`–CH₃`) is on carbon 3.\n        *   A **nitro** group (`–NO₂`) is on carbon 4.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the full name for **Product B**: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Selection**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these determined structures with the given options, only option A provides the correct names for both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reagents:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, non-nucleophilic, sterically hindered base. Its role is to deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone will be deprotonated to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which will be attacked by the enolate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group C=O): C2 and C6.\n        *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n        *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position. This forms a single regioisomer of the enolate, where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 carbon becomes the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, the intermediate enolate is protonated during workup to yield the final product. The ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` chain.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product using IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...substituent...)propanoate`.\n    *   Now, we name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the parent chain is numbered as C1'. To give the principal group on the ring (the keto group) the lowest possible number, we number the ring such that the keto group is at C2'.\n        *   **Attachment point (original C6)** becomes **C1'**. It has a methyl group (`1-methyl`).\n        *   **Carbonyl carbon (original C1)** becomes **C2'** (`2-oxo`).\n        *   **Original C2** becomes **C3'**. It has an ethyl and a methyl group (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these parts alphabetically gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and D, and rules out options B and C.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reagents:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the carbon α to the nitro group.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), which is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group. The α-carbon in 1-nitropropane has two acidic protons.\n    *   The nucleophile is the nitronate anion: `CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. For CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN, the attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH group bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting anion is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon. This chain is 6 carbons long.

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is tertiary and has one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from C-6, forming the corresponding enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, with its nucleophilic carbon at C-6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n4.  **Product Structure A**: The resulting product is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This specific IUPAC name arises from numbering the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain, where the point of attachment to the ring is C-1 of the substituent.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), creates a nucleophile from 1-nitropropane, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The nitro group (-NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic. KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n4.  **Product Structure B**: After protonation by water, the final product is formed.

This results in a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH₂(C6)-CH(NO₂)(C5)-CH(CH₃)(C4)-CH₂(C3)-CH₂(C2)-CN(C1)\n    *   Let's retrace the IUPAC numbering carefully based on the connectivity: `CN(C1)-CH2(C2)-CH(CH3)(C3)-CH(NO2)(C4)-CH2(C5)-CH3(C6)`.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nMatching these products with the given options leads to the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):** The base used is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong and sterically hindered base. It will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group), so it has no protons to be removed.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a hydrogen and a methyl group). This is the only position where deprotonation can occur.\n    *   The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6, creating a nucleophilic enolate.\n\n2.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The enolate formed at C6 of the cyclohexanone will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** After the nucleophilic attack, the resulting intermediate is protonated to yield the final product, A. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the original ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The structure is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the options, we need to name this structure according to IUPAC rules where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   For naming the substituent, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as C1 of the ring.\n        *   This position (the original C6 of the ketone) has a methyl group, so there is a `1-methyl` substituent.\n        *   The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (original C1) becomes C2, so there is a `2-oxo` substituent.\n        *   The next carbon (original C2) becomes C3, which has both an ethyl and a methyl group, leading to `3-ethyl` and `3-methyl` substituents.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nucleophile):** The base KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane. These protons are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group. This creates the nucleophile `CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`.\n\n2.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, `CH₃CH=CHCN`). The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of this α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, B. A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, the nitrile group (`-CN`) has the highest priority and determines the suffix and numbering of the parent chain. The chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nMatching these two products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\n### Analysis of Reactions\n\nThe user has requested the major products for two separate chemical reactions. Both are examples of the Michael addition reaction.\n\n#### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a base-catalyzed Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no protons to be removed.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6, leading to a single possible enolate structure where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate, with its nucleophilic character at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation during workup, the added group is `–CH2CH2COOEt`.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The final product, **A**, is a cyclohexanone ring with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and the new ethyl propanoate group also at C6. The structure can be named as ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, although this involves an unconventional numbering of the cyclohexyl ring. Based on this analysis, options C and D are incorrect.\n\n#### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is another Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion acts as the Michael donor (nucleophile). The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n2.  **Nucleophile and Electrophile**:\n    *   The nucleophile is the anion of 1-nitropropane: `CH3CH2CH(NO2)⁻`.\n    *   The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile: `CH3CH=CHCN`. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting product has the structure `CH3CH2CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)CH2CN`. To name this compound (**B**), we find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon from the nitrile (CN) group.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile: `CN(1)–CH2(2)–CH(CH3)(3)–CH(NO2)(4)–CH2(5)–CH3(6)`.\n    *   This is a six-carbon chain, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is correctly identified as **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is correctly identified as **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nBoth reactions are examples of the Michael addition, a nucleophilic 1,4-conjugate addition of a stabilized carbanion (Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated compound (Michael acceptor).\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate → A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (a ketone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n    *   **Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate)**: The base abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity)**: We must identify the location of available α-protons. The α-carbons (adjacent to the C=O group) are C2 and C6.\n        *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group), so it has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Conclusion: Deprotonation can only occur at C6, forming a single, specific enolate. The steric hindrance of t-BuOK and thermodynamic vs. kinetic considerations are irrelevant here, as there is no other choice.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the ketone and the β-carbon (`CH₂`) of the acrylate. After protonation (workup), a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (A)**:\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (IUPAC Nomenclature)**: The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain. We must correctly name this complex substituent.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is the original C6 of the ketone. For substituent naming, this carbon is designated **C1**.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the principal group (the ketone, \"oxo\") the lowest possible number. The adjacent carbonyl carbon (original C1) becomes **C2**.\n    *   The substituents on this ring are: a **methyl** group at C1 (from the original C6), an **oxo** group at C2 (from the original C1), and an **ethyl** and **methyl** group at C3 (from the original C2).\n    *   Assembling the name gives: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor**: 1-nitropropane. The protons α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (an α,β-unsaturated nitrile).\n    *   **Base**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate)**: KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`), which is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic α-carbon attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (B)**:\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Carbon Counting & Parent Chain)**: The product's structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`).\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.

The attachment is at the 3-position of the propanoate.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl ring for IUPAC naming: The point of attachment is C1.

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two α-carbons, C2 and C6. The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one proton. Therefore, the base will abstract the proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate anion, with the negative charge on C6, acts as the nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition that forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** The resulting product has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this compound as per the given options, the ethyl propanoate part is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is the original C6 of the ring. For naming purposes, this carbon is now C1 of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1 of the substituent.\n    *   The ketone group (=O) is on the adjacent carbon, which is C2 (the original C1 of the ketone).\n    *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is now C3 of the substituent.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. This forms a carbanion (a nitronate ion), `[CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)]⁻`, which serves as the Michael donor.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the one in the `CH₃-CH=` part of the molecule.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting acyclic structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end, we find a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem involves a step-by-step analysis of two separate organic chemistry reactions, followed by the selection of the correct option that accurately describes the major products of both.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone that can form an enolate (the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a base (t-BuOK).\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no α-hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at the less sterically hindered C6 position to form the kinetic enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6-enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product A Structure and Naming:** The resulting product is named as an ethyl propanoate derivative, where the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. According to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the principal functional groups the lowest possible locants, starting from the point of attachment. The point of attachment (original C6) becomes C1. The carbonyl group (original C1) is at C2. The ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) are at C3. The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1. This leads to the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:** The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** This carbanion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n4.  **Product B Structure and Naming:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile. To name the product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN). The chain is six carbons long (hexanenitrile). The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. The resulting name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.

This is a ketone that can be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base indicates a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The α-carbons of the ketone are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The base removes the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate). The nucleophilic carbon is C6 of the enolate.\n    *   The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group), which is the electrophilic site in a conjugate addition.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n    *   After the addition and subsequent protonation (workup), the new substituent, a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate group), is attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   The resulting molecule is `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n    *   The options provide names where the product is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. We must name the cyclohexanone part as a substituent.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (C1'). This was C6 in the original ketone.\n    *   The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1' of the substituent name.\n    *   The carbonyl group (oxo) was at C1 of the ketone, which is adjacent to C6. So, the oxo group is at C2' in the new numbering.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups were at C2 of the ketone, which is adjacent to the carbonyl C1. So, these groups are at C3' in the new numbering.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexyl ring are: a methyl at C1', an oxo at C2', and an ethyl and a methyl at C3'.\n    *   Alphabetizing and numbering gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`), which is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n    *   After the addition and protonation by water, the final product is formed by connecting the two fragments:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael addition** reaction. The reaction involves an enolate (from the ketone) acting as a nucleophile and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) acting as a Michael acceptor. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the α-hydrogen at the C6 position. This forms a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. In this case, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The enolate (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the initial addition, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during the workup step to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring structure is maintained.\n    *   The substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) are unchanged.\n    *   At C6, the original hydrogen is replaced by the ethyl acrylate-derived group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (an ethoxycarbonylethyl group).\n    *   The resulting structure is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n6.  **Name the Product A and Compare with Options:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the propanoate chain is the parent and the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. Let's re-name our product according to this convention to match the options.\n    *   The main chain is ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl group is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated as C1.\n        *   The carbon of attachment (our original C6) has a methyl group. So, we have a **1-methyl** substituent.\n        *   The carbonyl group is on the adjacent carbon (our original C1), which becomes C2 in the substituent name. So, we have a **2-oxo** group.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (our original C2) is now C3 in the substituent name. So, we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for A in options A and C. The name in options B and D, which describes a 4-oxo product, is incorrect as the Michael addition occurs at the α-carbon (C6), adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane provides the nucleophile (a carbanion), and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group.\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is the CH carbon attached to the methyl group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond connects `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` to the `CH(CH₃)` part of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Name the Product B and Compare with Options:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN).\n    *   The chain is: `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`.\n    *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B in options A and D. The name in options B and C is incorrect; it corresponds to a different molecule with a different number of carbon atoms.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given choices, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile. The ethyl acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the site of enolate formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has no α-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only position with an α-proton, the bulky base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate this carbon to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) in a conjugate addition. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the cyclohexanone core with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and a new substituent at C6, which is an ethyl propanoate group attached via its C3.\n    *   Let's name this product. If we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3. The numbering of the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent starts at the point of attachment (C1).\n        *   The point of attachment (our original C6) is now C1 of the substituent name. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent, so it is at C2.\n        *   The quaternary carbon (original C2) is at position C3. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a nitro-Michael addition, a variation of the Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nitronate anion which is a potent nucleophile (a Michael donor). (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form the nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The nucleophilic attack will occur at the β-carbon (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the -CN group).\n\n3.  **Predict the Michael addition product:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        *   N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Enolate Formation**:\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It's important to correctly identify the structure and the available α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The name `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one` and `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one` refer to the same molecule, just with different numbering schemes for the carbon ring. Let's analyze the structure based on the name that clarifies the reactive site.\n    *   Using the name `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethylcyclohexan-2-one`, the carbonyl group is at position C2. The α-carbons are C1 and C3.\n    *   C3 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the ketone at the C1 position. This removes any ambiguity about which enolate is formed.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The enolate formed at C1 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After protonation (typically from the solvent or during workup), the final product is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The resulting molecule has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C1 position of the `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl` ring.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the product A listed in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon alpha to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion. This anion then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n\n2.  **Reactant Analysis and Nucleophile Formation**:\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2`) to form the nitronate anion `[CH3-CH2-CH-NO2]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**:\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane part and C3 of the butenenitrile part.\n\n4.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The initial adduct is protonated by water to give the final product: `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile, we have a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the product B listed in options A and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   **Product B** is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option C contains both correct products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (C2 and C6). The C2 carbon is quaternary and has no hydrogens. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one acidic alpha-hydrogen. Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, forming a single regioselective enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure**: After the addition and subsequent protonation (during workup), a `-CH2-CH2-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone. The product is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product according to IUPAC rules, the ester is considered the principal functional group, making the \"ethyl propanoate\" the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl substituent ring starts with C1 at the point of attachment. The ketone group should have the lowest possible number, which makes it C2.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are a methyl group at C1 (the original C6-methyl) and an ethyl and a methyl group at C3 (the original C2-substituents).\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon), which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion is a nucleophile (a Michael donor). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH3CH2CH-NO2]⁻`.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting structure after protonation by water is `CH3-CH(CH(NO2)CH2CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming**: To name this product, the nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group, and the carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain: `CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.

The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming a single regioselective enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate. After protonation during workup, the added group is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming**: The product is an ester, so it is named as a substituted propanoate. The ethyl group comes from the ethyl acrylate ester. The main chain is the three-carbon propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at C2.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups are on C3 (the original C2).\n    *   The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition, specifically a nitro-Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane.\n2.  **Nitronate Formation**: The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂) is acidic. KOH removes a proton from this carbon to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion, `[CH₃-CH₂-CH=NO₂]⁻`.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming**: The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is designated as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group has six carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile:\n        *   A methyl group is on C3.\n        *   A nitro group is on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically hindered. It will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is substituted with both an ethyl and a methyl group, meaning it has no α-protons and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The C6 carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at the C6 position, making the reaction highly regioselective. The resulting enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** The resulting product will have an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The full structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:** To match the options provided, we name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is designated as C1. The carbonyl group (the original C1) is at the adjacent position, C2. The original C2, bearing the ethyl and methyl groups, becomes C3.\n    *   Following this numbering, the substituent name is: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of the nitroalkane.\n\n1.  **Nitronate Formation:** The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) is acidic. KOH removes a proton to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** After the addition and subsequent protonation by water, the resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is named as a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the carbon of the nitrile group as C1.\n    *   The chain is `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Thus, the name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.

The bulky nature of t-BuOK favors the formation of the kinetic enolate (from the less substituted α-carbon), but in this case, C6 is the only option.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The enolate anion, with the nucleophilic charge on C6, attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   **Enolate (nucleophile):** The anion at C6 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   **Ethyl Acrylate (acceptor):** CH₂=CH−COOEt.

The nucleophilic attack occurs from the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Nitronate (nucleophile):** The anion at C1 of the 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **But-2-enenitrile (acceptor):** CH₃-CH=CH-CN.

The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.

This leads to the name **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n*   **Product B:** The carbanion from 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH(-)NO2`) adds to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The resulting carbon chain is `CH3CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`. Numbering from the nitrile group (C1), the longest chain is a hexanenitrile. This gives the name **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can identify the correct choice among the options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the correct products for two Michael addition reactions\n    and selects the corresponding option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Analysis of Reaction A ---\n    # Reactants: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate\n    # Reagent: t-BuOK (Potassium tert-butoxide)\n    # Reaction Type: Michael Addition\n    # The enolate forms at C6 and attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    # Naming the resulting structure as a propanoate ester gives:\n    product_A_name = \"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\"\n\n    # --- Analysis of Reaction B ---\n    # Reactants: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n    # Reagents: KOH, H2O\n    # Reaction Type: Michael Addition\n    # The alpha-carbon of deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the beta-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    # Naming the resulting structure as a nitrile gives:\n    product_B_name = \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"\n\n    # --- Options provided in the problem ---\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\"),\n        \"B\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"),\n        \"C\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\"),\n        \"D\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"),\n    }\n\n    # --- Find the correct option ---\n    correct_option = None\n    for choice, (name_A, name_B) in options.items():\n        if name_A == product_A_name and name_B == product_B_name:\n            correct_option = choice\n            break\n\n    # --- Print the final answer ---\n    if correct_option:\n        print(correct_option)\n    else:\n        # This part should not be reached if the analysis is correct\n        print(\"Analysis did not match any of the given options.\")\n\nsolve_reaction_puzzle()\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: D\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Formation of Product A**\n\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone that can act as a Michael donor after being deprotonated.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The combination of these reactants points to a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has **no** α-protons.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. This is not a matter of choice between kinetic or thermodynamic control; it is the only possible site for enolate formation.\n    *   The structure of the starting ketone:\n        ```\n             O\n            // (1)\n           C -- C(Et)(Me) (2)\n          /  \\\n      (6)C(H)(Me) -- C (3)\n        |          |\n      (5)C -------- C (4)\n        ```\n    *   The t-BuOK removes the proton from C6, forming a nucleophilic enolate at C6.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The C6 enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 attacks the terminal CH₂ of the CH₂=CHCOOEt group.

The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The main chain is `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   Let's analyze the name in options B and D: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This name implies the following structure for the cyclohexyl substituent:\n        *   The attachment to the propanoate chain is at **C1**.\n        *   C1 also has a **methyl** group.\n        *   The carbonyl (oxo) group is at **C2**.\n        *   C3 has an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Let's draw this structure:\n        ```\n               O=C2\n              /   \\\n        C1(Me, R) -- C3(Et, Me)   (where R is the -CH₂CH₂COOEt group)\n        |             |\n        C6H₂ -------- C4H₂\n         \\           /\n            C5H₂\n        ```\n    *   Comparing this structure with our predicted product, we see they are identical.

The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the NO₂ group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) and can be removed by a base.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base sufficient to deprotonate the nitroalkane.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is another **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Carbanion Formation**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon (C1) of 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. In `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, the β-carbon is the `CH` group next to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Protonation**\n    *   The resulting nitrile-stabilized carbanion intermediate is protonated by water to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure and Name of Product B**\n    *   Let's assemble the final structure by connecting the pieces:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n        *   Combined structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

This matches the name for B in options A and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains both correct product names.\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A and B)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   C6 has one α-proton and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The bulky base t-BuOK will abstract the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6-enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The structure is: 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provided use a different IUPAC naming convention where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    *   Parent chain: `ethyl ...propanoate`. The substituent is attached at the C3 position of the propanoate chain. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   Substituent: The cyclohexyl ring. According to IUPAC rules, the numbering of the substituent ring starts at the point of attachment.\n        *   The point of attachment is the original C6 of the ketone.

This reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (a Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound or other electron-withdrawing group (a Michael acceptor).\n\n#### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons are at positions 2 and 6. Carbon 2 has no protons as it is fully substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. Carbon 6 has one acidic proton. Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK will selectively deprotonate at the C6 position to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n4.  **Product Structure & Nomenclature**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. To name the resulting product as a propanoate ester, the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. Following IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as C1'. The numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group (the ketone's oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2'. The original substituents of the ketone are located accordingly.\n    *   **Substituent at C3 of ethyl propanoate**: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`\n    *   **Full name of Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n\n#### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: Protons on the carbon adjacent to a nitro group are acidic. KOH is a sufficiently strong base to deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂), forming a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n4.  **Product Structure & Nomenclature**: A new C-C bond is formed. The resulting acyclic product needs to be named according to IUPAC rules for nitriles. The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group (-CN) is identified as the parent chain.\n    *   **Structure**: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   **Parent chain**: The longest chain including the nitrile carbon has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   **Numbering**: The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   **Substituents**: A methyl group is at C3 and a nitro group is at C4.\n    *   **Full name of Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the mechanistic analysis of both Michael addition reactions and the application of IUPAC nomenclature rules:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis is a Michael addition reaction. The t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To form an enolate, an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) must be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with both an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 has one methyl group and one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Due to the absence of α-hydrogens at position 2, the base can only abstract the proton from position 6. This enolate is the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate formed at C-6 will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor) in a conjugate addition.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):** The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming of Product A:** To name the resulting molecule as a propanoate derivative (as given in the options), the ethyl propanoate chain is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   For naming the substituent ring, the point of attachment (the original C-6) is numbered as C-1. This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   The ketone group (original C-1) is now at position 2 of the substituent ring.\n    *   The original C-2, which has both an ethyl and a methyl group, is now at position 3 of the substituent ring.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full IUPAC name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction. The base (KOH) deprotonates the nitroalkane, which then acts as the nucleophile.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nitronate (Michael Donor):** KOH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-hydrogen from 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`) to form a stabilized carbanion known as a nitronate ion.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`), which is the Michael acceptor. The attack occurs at the carbon bearing the methyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a derivative of a nitrile. The nitrile carbon is C-1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group on C-3 and a nitro group on C-4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect A, Correct B\n*   B) Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   C) Correct A, Correct B\n*   D) Correct A, Incorrect B\n\nThe correct choice is the one that accurately identifies both products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe analysis of both reactions appears to be correct based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n**Reaction A: Michael Addition**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a bulky base.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. The base deprotonates the starting ketone to form an enolate. The only available α-proton is on carbon 6 (C6), as C2 is a quaternary carbon. The t-BuOK abstracts this proton to form the enolate at C6. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate in a conjugate addition.\n*   **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The resulting substituent at C6 is a `-(CH2)2COOEt` group.\n*   **Product Name (A):** To name the product, if we consider the propanoate as the parent chain, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3. The point of attachment on the ring is designated as C1 for naming purposes. The original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes C2, and the original C2 becomes C3. Therefore, the substituent is named (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl). The full IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options A and C.\n\n**Reaction B: Michael Addition**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Catalyst:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon adjacent to the nitro group), which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the NO2 group. The resulting nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Product Structure:** The nucleophilic carbon from 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2-CH-NO2`) bonds to the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`-CH(CH3)-`). The final structure after protonation is `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n*   **Product Name (B):** For IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) has priority and its carbon is designated as C1. The longest carbon chain containing this group has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile. The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. Thus, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches options B and C.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBoth of these products correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate then acts as a nucleophile and adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at position C1. We need to identify the α-carbons, which are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C2 and C6).\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has one α-proton.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at C6 to form the corresponding enolate. The negative charge (and the nucleophilic character) will be on C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The initial structure of the ketone is: C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -H).\n    *   After the reaction, the hydrogen at C6 is replaced by the `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group from ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting product has the following connectivity on the cyclohexane ring: C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt). C6 is now a quaternary carbon.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   We need to name the product structure: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This naming convention treats the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain and the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. The propanoate chain is attached to the ring at some position.\n    *   Let's renumber our product structure to match this naming style. The IUPAC rules for naming a substituted cycloalkane attached to a side chain can be complex, but the options guide us. The name in options C and D is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. Let's verify if our product matches this name.\n    *   Let's analyze the name:\n        *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is on C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   The substituent is a `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. The attachment to the propanoate is at C1 of the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   Let's draw the structure from this name:\n        *   The cyclohexyl ring has an attachment point at C1.\n        *   C1 also has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 has an oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Now, let's compare this to our derived product structure `[C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt)]`. We can renumber our structure:\n        *   Let Old C6 be New C1.\n        *   Let Old C1 be New C2.\n        *   Let Old C2 be New C3.\n    *   With this new numbering, the substituents are:\n        *   New C1 (was Old C6): has a methyl group and the attachment to the ethyl propanoate chain.\n        *   New C2 (was Old C1): has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (was Old C2): has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   This structure perfectly matches the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. 1-Nitroalkanes have acidic protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group). KOH is a strong base that will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane. The resulting nitronate anion is a good nucleophile. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which is a Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂).\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   The α-carbon is adjacent to the -CN group (C2), and the β-carbon is next to that (C3). Structure: C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon (C1) of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The bond formation connects the `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-` fragment to the `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment (after protonation of the intermediate enolate/nitrile anion by water).\n    *   The final structure is: **CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n    *   We identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   The chain is: **C⁶**H₃-**C⁵**H₂-**C⁴**H(NO₂)-**C³**H(CH₃)-**C²**H₂-**C¹**N.\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) A is incorrect.\nB) Both A and B are incorrect.\nC) Both A and B are correct.\nD) B is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem requires identifying the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone that can be deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The t-BuOK will abstract the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C6 is the nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).\n    *   The C6 of the cyclohexanone ring forms a new carbon-carbon bond with the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring had an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    *   After the reaction, a new substituent, `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate), is attached to the C6 carbon.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring where C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product by treating the ethyl propanoate moiety as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate (`ethyl OOC-CH₂(2')-CH₂(3')`).\n    *   The substituent is attached to C3' of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring. The IUPAC rules for such complex substituents can be tricky, but the key is to match the connectivity. Let's number the ring of the substituent starting from the point of attachment as C1. The ketone carbonyl must be given the lowest possible number.\n        *   C1 (point of attachment) corresponds to the original C6 of the ketone. It has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 corresponds to the original C1 of the ketone. It now has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3 corresponds to the original C2 of the ketone. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent (α) to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also called crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Solvent/Proton Source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate anion):**\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts an acidic proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The carbanion (`CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   Let's connect the fragments:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)–`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `–CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   Combining them gives the product: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (–CN), so this carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 is a 6-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

This set of reactants is characteristic of a **Michael addition**. The ketone will act as the Michael donor after being deprotonated to form an enolate, and the ethyl acrylate will act as the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone. Let's examine the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n    *   **C2 (alpha to the carbonyl):** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n    *   **C6 (alpha to the carbonyl):** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has one acidic α-proton.\n    *   Since only C6 has an α-proton, deprotonation occurs exclusively at this position to form a specific enolate. This enolate anion is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enolate (at C6) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. Subsequent protonation during the work-up step yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and IUPAC Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone.\n    *   To name the product, we follow IUPAC rules. The ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the parent chain is based on the ester. The `...-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` fragment makes the parent name **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Now, we must name the complex substituent ring. The point of attachment to the parent chain (the original C6 of the ketone) is given the lowest possible locant, C1'. The principal functional group on the ring, the ketone (`=O`), should then receive the lowest possible number, which is C2'.\n    *   Based on this numbering:\n        *   The methyl group from the original C6 is now on C1'.\n        *   The carbonyl group is at C2' (indicated by `-oxo`).\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups from the original C2 are now on C3'.\n    *   The name of the substituent is therefore **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The complete name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This name matches the name for product A in options C and D, so we can eliminate options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, and a base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane is the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`). The protons on this carbon are acidic because the resulting carbanion (a nitronate anion, `CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂`) is stabilized by the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group through resonance.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. Protonation from water yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and IUPAC Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂) – CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long. Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end:\n        `CN(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(CH₃)(3) - CH(NO₂)(4) - CH₂(5) - CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at position C3 and a nitro group at position C4.\n    *   The complete name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This name matches the name for product B in option C. The name for B in option D (2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile) is incorrect as it describes a different molecule with a four-carbon parent chain.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBoth of these correct names are found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nAnswering based on the provided information and the executed code output.\n\n**Reasoning Confirmation:**\n\nThe step-by-step chemical analysis for both reactions has been performed.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The Michael addition between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate correctly produces **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This is because the only available acidic alpha-proton is at the C6 position, which leads to this specific constitutional isomer.\n*   **Reaction B:** The Michael addition between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile correctly produces **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**, based on the IUPAC nomenclature rules for the resulting structure.\n\nThe provided code execution output confirms this analysis:\n*   `Analysis for Product A matches Option C: True`\n*   `Analysis for Product B matches Option C: True`\n*   `Conclusion: Option C is correct.`\n\nThe code successfully mapped the derived product structures to the names provided in option C, verifying the correctness of the analysis.

The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will remove an acidic alpha-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: Ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The ketone has two alpha-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no alpha-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5) and has one acidic alpha-proton.\n    *   The t-BuOK base will abstract the only available alpha-proton from C6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The resulting enolate is a nucleophile. It will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate in a conjugate addition.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation (usually from the solvent or during workup), the final product is formed.\n\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**:\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The IUPAC naming for such a complex molecule can be approached by treating the larger cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`:\n        *   `ethyl ... propanoate`: This indicates the `CH₂CH₂COOEt` chain.\n        *   The cyclohexyl group is a substituent attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n        *   C1 (formerly C6 of the ketone) has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 (formerly C1 of the ketone) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3 (formerly C2 of the ketone) has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   This matches the name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**: This is a nitro-Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor**: 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`).

My initial step-by-step analysis of both reactions led to a specific product for each.\n\nFor Reaction A (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK), I determined the product is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This is based on the Michael addition mechanism where the only available α-proton on the C6 carbon is removed by the base to form an enolate, which then attacks the ethyl acrylate. The naming convention was confirmed by renumbering the resulting substituted cyclohexane ring, with the point of attachment being C1.\n\nFor Reaction B (1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH), I deduced the product is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This is also a Michael addition, where the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane becomes a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile. The IUPAC name was derived from the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group.\n\nThe combination of these two products, A and B, directly corresponds to option A. The google search results confirm the general principles of Michael additions for both types of nucleophiles (ketone enolates and nitroalkane anions) and acceptors (α,β-unsaturated esters and nitriles). The searches also confirm the acidity of α-protons in nitroalkanes and ketones, which is the prerequisite for the reaction. The term \"conjugate addition\" is used synonymously with Michael addition. The regioselectivity in ketone enolate formation is a key factor, and in this specific ketone, there is only one position with an α-hydrogen, making the reaction regioselective. Therefore, the initial analysis is well-supported by established chemical principles. No conflicting information was found. I am confident in my initial conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer Determination:\n- Product A: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n- Product B: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n- This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate will then attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two alpha-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon, and C3) and has no alpha-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon and has one alpha-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the carbon of ethyl acrylate that is beta to the ester group.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The addition of the ethyl acrylate fragment to C6 of the ketone results in a `-(CH₂CH₂COOEt)` chain being attached at this position.\n    *   To name the final product, the propanoate chain is considered the parent structure. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the third carbon of the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   When naming the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1. The carbonyl carbon (original C1) becomes C2. The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) becomes C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The complete name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a nitro-Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane. This carbon is acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. The resulting nitronate anion is a good nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbon from the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   **Nucleophile**: `CH₃-CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂`\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the beta-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). According to IUPAC rules, the carbon of the nitrile is C1, and we find the longest carbon chain that includes it.\n    *   The longest chain is six carbons long (hexanenitrile).\n        `⁶CH₃-⁵CH₂-⁴CH(NO₂)-³CH(CH₃)-²CH₂-¹CN`\n    *   The chain has a methyl group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone with an α-hydrogen (enolate precursor), a strong bulky base (t-BuOK), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate an α-carbon of the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has **no α-hydrogens**.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from C6, leading to the formation of a single, specific enolate.\n\n    ```\n          O                     O(-)\n         //                    //\n        /  \\                   /  \\\n       |    |--Me    + t-BuO-  <=>  C----C(Me)  + t-BuOH\n    Et-|----|                      |    |\n    Me-|----/                  Et--|----|\n                               Me--|----/\n    Ketone                  (Enolate at C6)\n    ```\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The C6 carbon of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n\n    ```\n    (Enolate at C6) + CH₂=CH-COOEt   --->   Intermediate\n    ```\n    A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate is protonated (e.g., during an aqueous workup or by the t-BuOH formed in the first step) to give the final product, **A**.\n\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n        /  \\\n       |    |--Me\n    Et-|----|   |\n    Me-|----/   CH₂-CH₂-COOEt\n    ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** To name the product, we follow IUPAC nomenclature. The question names it as a substituted propanoate.\n    *   Parent chain: `ethyl ... propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). This carbon becomes C1'.\n    *   Numbering the ring to give the lowest possible locants for all substituents:\n        *   C1' is the attachment point and has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3' has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. We have a nitroalkane with acidic α-protons, a strong base (KOH), and an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:** The base, hydroxide (OH⁻ from KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion, which is the nucleophile.\n\n    ```\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂  +  OH⁻   <=>   CH₃-CH₂-CH(-)-NO₂  +  H₂O\n                                (Nucleophilic carbanion)\n    ```\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-C**H**=CH-CN).\n\n    ```\n            (Nucleophile)            (Michael acceptor)\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH(-)-NO₂   +   CH₃-CH=CH-CN   --->   Intermediate\n    ```\n    A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, **B**.\n\n    ```\n            NO₂\n            |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH — CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:** To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons.

The process involves the formation of a nucleophile from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong and sterically hindered base.

This setup is characteristic of a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of deprotonation.**\nThe base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which acts as the nucleophile. The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **α-carbon at C2:** This carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon C1, and C3). It has no protons, so it cannot be deprotonated.\n*   **α-carbon at C6:** This carbon is tertiary (bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon C1, and C5). It has one acidic proton.\nTherefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. This is a crucial point determined by the structure of the starting ketone.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the electrophile and the site of attack.**\nThe electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), which is a Michael acceptor. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. For ethyl acrylate, the attack occurs at the terminal CH₂ group.\n\n**Step 4: Form the product.**\nThe enolate formed at C6 of the cyclohexanone attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate moiety. The reaction is completed by protonation (usually during workup) of the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure and name of Product A.**\n*   **Starting material:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Attachment:** The `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6.\n*   **Product structure:** The product is a cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents: an oxo group at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, a methyl group at C6, and the new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n*   **Naming the product:** The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. In this convention, the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is named C1 of the cyclohexyl ring substituent. In our product, this is the original C6.\n    *   Numbering the ring from this attachment point (C1') to give the principal functional group (ketone) the lowest possible number, the oxo group is at C2'.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (originally at C6).\n        *   An oxo group at C2' (originally the C1 carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C3' (originally at C2).\n    *   So, the cyclohexyl substituent is named (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of reaction.**\nThis reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the nucleophile and the site of deprotonation.**\nThe base, KOH, deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at its α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the –NO₂ group). The α-protons of nitroalkanes are quite acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion (nitronate anion).\n*   Nucleophile: `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the electrophile and the site of attack.**\nThe electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). It is a Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon, which is the CH group adjacent to the methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Form the product.**\nThe carbanion of 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.

This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The carbonyl group is at C1.\n        *   α-carbon at C2: It is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has **no α-protons**.\n        *   α-carbon at C6: It is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6 to form an enolate ion with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The enolate attacks the CH₂ group of CH₂=CHCOOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Protonation (Workup):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated, typically during workup, to yield the final product.\n    *   The final structure has an ethyl propanoate side chain (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (Product A):**\n    *   The structure is 6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The options use a different IUPAC naming convention where the side chain is the parent and the ring is a substituent.

The name will be `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n        *   **Substituent Name:** The ring is attached at its C6 position. In substituent nomenclature, this attachment point is numbered C1'. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the other functional groups the lowest possible locants.\n            *   C1' is the point of attachment (original C6).

The search results confirm the general principles of Michael additions.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** This is a Michael addition. The donor is the enolate of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, and the acceptor is ethyl acrylate. The strong, bulky base t-BuOK will deprotonate the ketone at the only available α-carbon with protons, which is C6. The resulting enolate will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The naming convention used in the options, where the resulting cycloalkanone is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain, is unusual for a final product name but acceptable for analysis. My structural analysis confirmed that the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` correctly describes the connectivity of the product formed.\n*   **Reaction B:** This is a nitro-Michael addition. The base KOH deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (a nitronate). This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). My step-by-step analysis of the bond formation and subsequent IUPAC naming led to the product `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. The search results confirm that Michael additions of nitroalkanes to activated alkenes like nitriles are standard reactions.\n\nCombining the results:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\nFinal check of all options:\n*   **Option A:** Correctly identifies both products A and B.\n*   **Option B:** Incorrectly identifies the structure of product A (oxo group at position 4 instead of 2). Correctly identifies product B.\n*   **Option C:** Incorrectly identifies the structure of product A (oxo group at position 4). Incorrectly identifies product B (butanenitrile instead of hexanenitrile).\n*   **Option D:** Correctly identifies product A. Incorrectly identifies product B.\n\nBased on this, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo determine the major products of the two reactions, we need to analyze each reaction mechanism, considering steric hindrance and product stability. Both reactions are examples of the Michael addition.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, where a nucleophile adds to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is an enolate, and the α,β-unsaturated compound is ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically hindered. It will deprotonate the starting ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no protons to remove.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate can only form by deprotonating C6.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate formed at C6 will act as a nucleophile and attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt). This is a conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond will form between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure A:** The resulting product will have the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) attached to the C6 carbon of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n5.  **Product Naming:** The IUPAC name given in the options can be confusing. Let's decipher the name provided in options C and D: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name treats the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The attachment point on the ring is designated C1.\n    *   Let's renumber our product according to this convention: The original C6 (the point of attack) becomes the new C1. The adjacent carbon with the ketone group (original C1) becomes C2. The next carbon (original C2) becomes C3.\n    *   With this new numbering, C1 has a methyl group and the propanoate chain attached. C2 is a ketone (=O). C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   This connectivity perfectly matches the name `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`. Thus, product A is correctly named `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nucleophile is a nitronate anion, and the acceptor is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), will deprotonate the acidic α-proton of 1-nitropropane (CH3CH2CH2NO2). The nitro group makes the protons on the adjacent carbon (C1) acidic, forming a nitronate anion `[CH3CH2CHNO2]−`.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n4.  **Product Structure B:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The structure after protonation by water is `CH3CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming:** To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is selected as the parent chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `NC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position C3 and a nitro group at position C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   Product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option C provides the correct names for both products A and B.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a breakdown of the two reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Synthesis of Product A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) as the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, t-BuOK, deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n*   **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons to be removed.\n    *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, leading to a single, specific enolate.\n*   **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n*   **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product, A, is named by treating the propanoate chain as the parent. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the third carbon of the ethyl propanoate chain. Following IUPAC naming rules:\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The substituent is attached at C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). This carbon (C1' of the substituent) has a methyl group. The original carbonyl group is now at C2' (2-oxo), and the original C2, with its ethyl and methyl groups, is at C3' (3-ethyl-3-methyl).\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Synthesis of Product B**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile), with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion. This nucleophile then attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Nucleophile Formation:** KOH removes a proton from the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂), forming the nucleophilic anion [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻.\n*   **Michael Addition:** This anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-**CH**=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n*   **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product, B, is a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile functional group is six carbons long, making it a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-**CH(NO₂)**(4)-**CH(CH₃)**(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the electrophilic Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   First, we need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring. The carbonyl group is at position C1.\n    *   The α-carbons are at C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible position for deprotonation is at C6.

This matches the name given for A in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the base and water (H₂O).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition, often called a nitro-Michael addition.\n\n1.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, will deprotonate the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate). The nucleophile is `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nitronate anion acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group (`CH₃-CH=`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The structure is formed by connecting `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-` to `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n\n4.  **Product Nomenclature:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   We must find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a `methyl` group at C3 and a `nitro` group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The base's role is to deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons relative to the carbonyl group (C1). They are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms the thermodynamic enolate, where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate acts as a nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ carbon.\n    *   This attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The reaction is completed by a protonation step (e.g., from the solvent or a workup), which quenches the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Product Structure A**: The resulting product has the ethyl acrylate chain, which becomes a `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group, attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The skeleton of the product is:\n        ```\n             O\n            //\n          C1--C2(Et, Me)\n         /   \\\n      C6(Me, CH₂CH₂COOEt)  C3\n      |       |\n      C5------C4\n        ```\n    *   Now, we need to name this product. According to the options, the product is named as an ethyl propanoate with a substituted cyclohexyl group.\n    *   Let's re-number the cyclohexyl ring for naming purposes, where the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is C1. This corresponds to the original C6.\n        *   **New C1** (original C6): Attached to the propanoate and has a methyl group. This fits the `1-methyl` part of the name `(..1,3-dimethyl..)`\n        *   Numbering the ring to give the ketone (oxo group) the lowest possible number, we number towards the original C1.\n        *   **New C2** (original C1): This is the carbonyl carbon (`-oxo-`). This fits the `2-oxo` part.\n        *   **New C3** (original C2): This carbon has an ethyl and a methyl group. This fits the `3-ethyl-3-methyl` part.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the structure for A in options A and B.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type Identification**: This reaction involves a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile), and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n    *   The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H**₂-NO₂) is acidic.\n    *   Deprotonation by OH⁻ yields the nucleophilic nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂**CH**⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile).\n    *   The structure of but-2-enenitrile is CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the one bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane forms a new C-C bond with the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n        `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]`---`[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]`\n    *   After protonation from the water solvent, we get the final product.\n\n4.  **Product Structure B**: The structure of the product is:\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n\n5.  **IUPAC Nomenclature**: To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon becomes the parent chain.

This eliminates option A.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies both products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem asks us to determine the major products of two separate reactions. Both are examples of the Michael addition reaction.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The strong base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which acts as the nucleophile (the Michael donor). This enolate will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** We must identify the acidic protons α (alpha) to the carbonyl group of the ketone.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only remove the single α-proton at the C6 position to form the enolate. There is no ambiguity in which enolate is formed.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the enolate anion attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n\n4.  **Product A Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation, a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position of the starting ketone. While the IUPAC names provided in the options seem to have typographical errors regarding the substituent positions, the reaction itself is straightforward. The product retains the ketone at the original position (or a tautomeric position).\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This anion is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile. The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Product B Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure after protonation (by H₂O) is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The nitrile carbon is designated C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing C1 has 6 carbons. The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group** on C3 and a **nitro group** on C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Our analysis shows that Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for Product B in options **B** and **C**. We can therefore eliminate options A and D.\n*   We must now choose between options B and C based on the name for Product A. As noted, there is likely a typo in the name for A. However, the name in option B describes a \"2-oxocyclohexyl\" derivative, which is consistent with the product of a Michael addition on a cyclohexanone. The name in option C describes a \"4-oxocyclohexyl\" derivative, which is not a plausible product from this reaction.\n*   Based on the definite identification of Product B, and the greater chemical plausibility of the product type for A in option B, we select B as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis problem requires predicting the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. A strong base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is used to create a nucleophile (an enolate) from the ketone. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base needs to remove a proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) to form an enolate.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (it has no hydrogen atoms attached), so it cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 is a tertiary carbon and has one hydrogen atom.\n    *   The bulky base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the C6 position to form the only possible enolate. This enolate is the thermodynamically and kinetically favored one.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate nucleophile attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Naming (Product A):** After workup, a proton is added to the intermediate. The resulting molecule has the `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached to the C6 carbon of the original ketone ring. To name this product according to the options, we treat the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   It is substituted at the C3 position with the `(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-1-oxocyclohexan-6-yl)` group. A more systematic name according to IUPAC substitution rules would number the ring starting from the point of attachment. Let's re-number the substituent ring for naming purposes:\n        *   The point of attachment (original C6) is C1. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (original C1) is C2. It has an oxo group.\n        *   The quaternary carbon (original C2) is C3. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is another Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) are acidic. KOH removes a proton from C1 to form the nucleophile: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Naming (Product B):** After the addition and protonation from water, the product is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. To name this molecule, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile (6 carbons including the nitrile carbon).\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1: `NC(1)−CH₂(2)−CH(CH₃)(3)−CH(NO₂)(4)−CH₂(5)−CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these names with the given options, we find that option B matches both results.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe user wants to identify the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate an alpha-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no alpha-protons. C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen). Therefore, the only available alpha-proton for deprotonation is at the C6 position.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n    *   The t-BuOK base deprotonates the ketone at C6, forming an enolate.\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After protonation (workup), the final product is formed.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The new substituent, `–CH2CH2COOCH2CH3`, is attached at C6.\n    *   To name the product as a propanoate derivative as given in the options, we identify the main chain as ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate.\n    *   The name is therefore `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). So, the attachment point is C1 of the substituent name.\n        *   The original C1 (ketone group) is now at position 2 -> `2-oxo`.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) is now at position 3 -> `3-ethyl-3-methyl`.\n        *   The original C6 (the point of attachment) also had a methyl group, which is now at position 1 -> `1-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

The alpha-protons (on the carbon adjacent to the NO2 group) are acidic and can be removed by a base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3CH=CHCN`), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (`CH3CH2CH⁻NO2`).\n    *   This carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water (H₂O) yields the final adduct.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH3CH2CH(NO2)–CH(CH3)CH2CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`).

The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically bulky. It will deprotonate the starting ketone to form an enolate.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen) and has one acidic hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at the C6 position, forming an enolate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation during workup, a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product is `2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`. To name this according to the options, the propanoate chain is treated as the parent, with the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent at its C3 position. The IUPAC naming rules require numbering the substituent ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6). To give the functional groups the lowest possible numbers, the carbonyl group (oxo) becomes position 2, and the ethyl/methyl-substituted carbon becomes position 3. This leads to the name **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction, involving a nitroalkane as the nucleophile donor.\n\n1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic proton from the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate) `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). The attack occurs at the carbon bearing the methyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is `(NO₂)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. To name this, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group, which is a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)–C(2)H₂–C(3)H(CH₃)–C(4)H(NO₂)–C(5)H₂–C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\nThis is a Michael addition reaction, a type of conjugate addition.\n\n1.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will remove the most acidic proton from the ketone to form an enolate. The most acidic protons are on the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons.\n    *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK will deprotonate the C6 carbon, as this is the only available α-proton. This forms a trisubstituted enolate.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate formed acts as a nucleophile (the Michael donor). It attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After the reaction mixture is worked up (protonated), the final product is formed. The resulting structure has the ketone at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group along with the new -(CH₂CH₂COOEt) chain at C6.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Product:** Let's analyze the options provided. The structure of product **A** must match our predicted product.\n    *   The name given in options B and D is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. Although the naming convention is unusual (naming the propanoate as the parent chain), the described structure perfectly matches our derived product. If we renumber the cyclohexanone ring to fit this name (with the carbonyl as C2), then C1 would be the original C6 (now with a methyl and the propanoate side-chain attachment) and C3 would be the original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups).\n\nTherefore, product **A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This forms a nucleophilic nitronate anion (CH₃CH₂CH=NO₂⁻).\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the carbon atom of the double bond that is further from the electron-withdrawing nitrile group.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Product:** We must determine the correct IUPAC name for this structure.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the carbon of the nitrile group (C1).\n    *   Following the longest chain, we find a methyl group at position C3 and a nitro group at position C4.\n    *   Thus, the correct name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate will then act as a nucleophile and add to the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate (the nucleophile):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group), so it has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 has one methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract a proton from C6. This leads to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate. The double bond of the enolate forms between C1 and C6.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons from the acrylate's C=C double bond shift to form an ester enolate intermediate.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The ester enolate intermediate is protonated during the aqueous workup (or by the t-butanol formed in the first step) to give the final product, A.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Identify the Product A:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl acrylate chain (now -CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   Let's analyze the IUPAC name of this product. The options name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The base chain is \"ethyl ...propanoate\". The ring is attached at position 3 of the propanoate.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment is C1.\n    *   Our product structure has the following features on the ring, using the new numbering system for the name:\n        *   C1: Point of attachment to the propanoate chain; also has a methyl group (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   C2: The keto group (=O) (the original C1).\n        *   C3: An ethyl group and a methyl group (the original C2 substituents).\n    *   Combining these parts gives the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and B. The name in options C and D suggests a \"4-oxocyclohexyl\" ring, meaning the keto group is at C4 relative to the attachment point. This would be the product of a different reaction, not a standard Michael addition. Thus, options C and D are incorrect for product A.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a base that deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The resulting carbanion (nitronate anion) attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   The hydrogens on the carbon atom attached to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   KOH removes one of these α-hydrogens to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Identify the Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon of the nitrile (-CN) group.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and D. The name in options B and C, \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile,\" corresponds to a product that would be formed from different starting materials (e.g., nitromethane and 3-methylbut-2-enenitrile).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The major product of the first reaction (A) is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The major product of the second reaction (B) is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe correct choice is the one that has both product structures correct. This is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\nThis is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong and sterically hindered base. It will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate. The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons, at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons.\n    *   The carbon at C6 is secondary (bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the enolate can only be formed by deprotonating at the C6 position.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate formed at C6 acts as a nucleophile (a Michael donor). It attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor), which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. This type of conjugate addition is favored for stabilized nucleophiles like enolates.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After the reaction mixture is neutralized, the intermediate enolate is protonated to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (A):** The resulting product is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To match the naming convention in the options, the molecule is named as a propanoate derivative. In this system, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The attachment point on the ring is designated C1.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) gets the next lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   The substituents from the original ketone are located: the ethyl and methyl groups are at C3 (originally C2), and the other methyl group is at C1 (originally C6).\n    *   Thus, the correct name for the cyclohexyl substituent is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options A and B. Options C and D are incorrect as they name it a 4-oxocyclohexyl derivative.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This creates a resonance-stabilized carbanion, [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻, which will act as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** This carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. Subsequent protonation by water yields the final product. The resulting structure is CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (B):** To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has six carbons (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   This places a methyl substituent at C3 and a nitro substituent at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for product B in options B and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct product for reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct product for reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two correct products, we find that option B provides the correct names for both A and B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) --> A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. The reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (t-BuOK).\n2.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates an α-carbon of the ketone to form an enolate (the Michael donor). The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons:\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    Therefore, the enolate can only form at the C6 position.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product A Structure & Name:**\n    *   The resulting product has an `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product, we follow IUPAC rules. The ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Thus, the molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We must number the cyclohexyl ring substituent, starting with C1 at the point of attachment to the propanoate chain.\n        *   The point of attachment is the original C6 of the ketone. This is the **new C1**. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The adjacent carbonyl carbon (original C1) is the **new C2**. It has an oxo group.\n        *   The next carbon (original C2) is the **new C3**. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This narrows down the correct option to either A or D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) --> B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. It involves a nitroalkane (which has acidic α-protons), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a base (KOH).\n2.  **Michael Donor Formation:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the acidic α-proton of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN, also known as crotononitrile).\n4.  **Product B Structure & Name:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane moiety and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile moiety.\n    *   The resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   To name this product, the nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group. The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This narrows down the correct option to either C or D.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, product A is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, and product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.

This is a substituted cyclohexanone, which can act as a nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base, ideal for forming enolates.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Enolate Formation (Careful Point: Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group), at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) will unambiguously deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position. This regioselectivity is not a matter of kinetic vs. thermodynamic control; it is the only possible site for enolate formation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed has its nucleophilic character at C6.\n    *   This C6 nucleophile will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   After protonation during the workup step, the side chain `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` is attached to C6.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To compare with the options, we must name this product according to IUPAC conventions where the propanoate is the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.

This eliminates options B and C.\n*   The only option that correctly identifies both products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (which can form an enolate), an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at C6 to form the enolate. The steric bulk of t-BuOK favors the formation of the less substituted (kinetic) enolate, but in this case, C6 is the only option, so the regiochemistry is fixed.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`). The enolate will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of this molecule.\n    `CH₂=CH-COOEt`\n    ` β   α`\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:** The C6 of the cyclohexanone enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between these two atoms.\n    *   **Donor part:** The cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   **Acceptor part:** `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (after attack and protonation).\n    *   The new substituent, a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group, is attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n\n    The structure of product A is:\n    ```\n             O\n            //\n        C1--C2(Et, Me)\n       /    \\\n    C6(Me, CH₂CH₂COOEt)--C5\n     \\                  /\n      C4--------------C3\n    ```\n\n5.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the ester, so the parent name is based on **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone moiety is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, we number the cyclohexyl ring starting from the point of attachment as C1'.\n    *   The point of attachment (original C6) is **C1'**. It has a methyl group, so we have `1-methyl`.\n    *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent to the attachment point, so it is at **C2'**. This gives `2-oxo`.\n    *   The quaternary carbon with ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is at **C3'**.

This is also a **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base, KOH, will deprotonate the nitroalkane at the α-carbon.\n    *   The starting nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂`).\n    *   The α-carbon (C1) has two acidic protons. Deprotonation by `OH⁻` forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`\n    `     β   α`\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Bond formation: `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]` attacks `CH₃-CH(β)`.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`). The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon becomes the parent chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest chain is 6 carbons long: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

The strong, sterically hindered base, t-BuOK, selectively removes the only available α-proton from the C6 position of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one to form a kinetic enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The resulting product structure is named as a substituted propanoate, where the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. When naming the ring as a substituent, the numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6). Consequently, the propanoate chain and a methyl group are at C1, the oxo group is at C2 (originally C1), and the ethyl and another methyl group are at C3 (originally C2). This leads to the IUPAC name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition, sometimes referred to as a conjugate addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, creating a nitronate anion. This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). The final product is formed after protonation by water. For IUPAC naming, the main functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the carbon chain is named as a nitrile. The longest carbon chain, including the nitrile carbon, is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1. This places the methyl substituent at C3 and the nitro group at C4. Therefore, the correct name for the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nBy combining the correct products for both reactions, we find that A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate and B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe problem asks for the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions. The Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (a Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor). The selection of the major product depends on factors like steric hindrance and the stability of intermediates and final products.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically bulky base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):**\n    The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The ketone has two α-positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position C6 is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen.\n    Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Conjugate Addition:**\n    The C6 of the enolate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. Subsequent protonation yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    A new substituent, an `ethyl propanoate` chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`), is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this new, more complex molecule according to IUPAC rules, the principal functional group dictates the base name. Here, the ester (`ethyl propanoate`) is named as the parent chain, and the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent.\n\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is at C1 of the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   The carbonyl group of the ketone is at the adjacent C2 position. Thus, the substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   The original substituents on the ring are renumbered according to this new scheme:\n        *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent ring (`1-methyl`).\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups on the original C2 are now on C3 of the substituent ring (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the systematic name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This rules out options A and B.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-hydrogens of nitroalkanes are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base/Solvent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H₂O).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nitronate (Michael Donor):**\n    The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n\n3.  **Conjugate Addition:**\n    The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the C3 of the butenenitrile. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    Let's trace the carbon backbone of the product:\n    *   From 1-nitropropane: `(NO₂)-CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(CN)-CH₂-CH-(CH₃)`\n    *   Connecting these at the point of attack gives: `(CN)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    To name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the highest priority functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest chain has six carbons, including the nitrile carbon. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   This places a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This rules out the `butanenitrile` product listed in options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is correctly named `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is correctly named `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the available α-protons to determine where the enolate will form.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to four other carbons) and has no protons.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 has one proton.\n    Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from the C6 position. This means the enolate will form with the double bond between C1 and C6. The regiochemistry is not in question.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a conjugate addition (1,4-addition). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting product is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one with an `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n5.  **IUPAC Naming**: According to IUPAC rules, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Thus, the molecule is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexyl group is attached to carbon 3 of this chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we start numbering from the point of attachment. Thus, the original C6 of the ketone ring is now C1 for the substituent name.\n    *   Following the ring from this new C1:\n        *   C1 has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 is the carbonyl carbon (`=O`), so we have a `2-oxo` group.\n        *   C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base KOH deprotonates the 1-nitropropane, and the resulting nucleophile attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon). KOH removes one of these protons to form a nitronate anion, `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`, which serves as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Electrophile**: The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as (E)-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), which is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the C1 of nitropropane and the C3 of the butenenitrile.\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**: After the attack and subsequent protonation by water, the resulting molecule is:\n    `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, so it is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   A methyl group is on C3 (`3-methyl`).\n    *   A nitro group is on C4 (`4-nitro`).\n    *   The complete IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n\n**1. Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the nucleophile precursor.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which will act as the electrophile.\n*   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n*   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n**2. Enolate Formation:**\n*   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group): C2 and C6.\n*   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n*   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n*   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-carbon, which is C6. This forms an enolate where the C=C double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 carbon becomes the nucleophilic center.\n\n**3. Michael Addition Step:**\n*   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. In ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt), the β-carbon is the CH2 group.\n*   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n*   The initial adduct is an enolate, which is then protonated during workup to yield the final product.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n*   **Starting Ketone:**\n    *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n    *   C2: Ethyl and methyl groups\n    *   C6: Methyl group\n*   **Product Structure:** A `–CH2CH2COOEt` group (from ethyl acrylate) is now attached to the C6 position of the ketone.\n    *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n    *   C2: Ethyl and methyl groups\n    *   C6: Methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`)\n*   **Naming:** Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The options use a naming system where the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's examine the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name implies that the main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The `cyclohexyl` group is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   The numbering of the `cyclohexyl` substituent starts from the point of attachment (C1).\n        *   C1 is attached to the propanoate chain and has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 has an oxo group (=O).\n        *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Let's see if the ketone that would form this product matches our starting material. To find the starting ketone, we remove the `–CH2CH2COOEt` group from C1 of the substituent and replace it with a hydrogen. The starting ketone would be `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexane`.\n    *   To get the standard IUPAC name for this ketone, we must number the ring to give the carbonyl group the lowest possible number (position 1).\n        *   The old C2 (with =O) becomes the new C1.\n        *   The old C1 becomes the new C6 (it has a methyl group).\n        *   The old C3 becomes the new C2 (it has an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    *   The IUPAC name of this starting ketone is **2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**, which perfectly matches the reactant given in the question.\n    *   Therefore, the structure described by `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` is the correct product A. The other name for product A, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, would originate from a different starting ketone and is incorrect.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n**1. Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH3CH2CH2NO2). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the NO2 group) are acidic.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also called crotononitrile, CH3CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n*   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n**2. Nitronate Formation:**\n*   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n*   Nucleophile: `[CH3CH2CH-NO2]`\n\n**3. Michael Addition Step:**\n*   The α,β-unsaturated system in but-2-enenitrile is `CH3(β)-CH=CH(α)-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the carbon of the CH group bonded to the methyl group).\n*   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n**4. Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n*   Let's connect the fragments:\n    `[CH3CH2-CH(NO2)]–[CH(CH3)-CH2-CN]`\n*   The resulting structure is: `CH3CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n*   To name this molecule using IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN), which has the highest priority.\n    1.  The nitrile carbon is C1.\n    2.  The longest chain is 6 carbons long: `N≡C(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    3.  The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    4.  The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n*   Arranging the substituents alphabetically, the final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n*   Let's check the other name for B in the options: `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. This molecule would have a total of 6 carbon atoms (butane chain=4C, +2 methyl groups=2C). The reaction between a C3 compound (1-nitropropane) and a C4 compound (but-2-enenitrile) must result in a product with C3 + C4 = 7 carbon atoms. Our derived product, 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile, has 7 carbons (hexane chain=6C, +1 methyl group=1C). Therefore, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile` is incorrect due to the carbon count alone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of the first reaction (A) is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of the second reaction (B) is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Synthesis of Product A**\n\n*   **Reactants and Reagents:** The reaction is a Michael addition between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) as the base.\n*   **Identifying the Nucleophile:** The base, t-BuOK, is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at its α-carbon to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   It has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one α-hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the base must abstract the only available α-hydrogen from the C6 position.\n*   **The Michael Addition:** The enolate formed acts as the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (H₂C=CH−COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Structure of Product A:**\n    1.  The starting ring has a C=O at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    2.  The Michael addition adds a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate chain) to the C6 position.\n    3.  This makes C6 a quaternary carbon, now bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and the new propanoate chain.\n*   **Naming Product A:** The options provided name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    1.  The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    2.  The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    3.  To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as position 1.\n        *   Position 1 (original C6) has a **methyl** group.\n        *   Position 2 (original C1) has the carbonyl (**oxo**) group.\n        *   Position 3 (original C2) has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    4.  Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    5.  Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the structure of A in options A and D.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Synthesis of Product B**\n\n*   **Reactants and Reagents:** This is a Michael addition between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the base in water.\n*   **Identifying the Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group). This forms a nitronate anion, which is a potent carbon nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`\n*   **The Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n*   **Structure of Product B:**\n    1.  A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane component and the β-carbon of the nitrile component.\n    2.  The resulting molecule's backbone is formed by linking these two parts: `(from nitropropane part) CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - (from nitrile part) CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   **Naming Product B:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) has higher priority and determines the numbering of the parent chain.\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is a 6-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    2.  We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    3.  The substituents on this chain are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    4.  Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the structure of B in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option A correctly identifies both products.\n\nA) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nB) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nC) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\nD) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for determining the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition. A strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) will create an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (α-carbons) are C2 and C6. We must check for acidic α-protons on these carbons.\n    *   **α-Carbon at C2:** This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl, an ethyl group, and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no attached hydrogen atoms. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   **α-Carbon at C6:** This carbon is bonded to the carbonyl, a methyl group, and a single hydrogen atom. This hydrogen is an acidic α-proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The strong, bulky base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6, leading to the formation of a single, specific enolate ion where C6 is the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`). The β-carbon is the one furthest from the ester group in the C=C double bond.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon single bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the `CH₂` group) of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   After the reaction and subsequent protonation (workup), the ethyl acrylate part becomes a saturated `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` group.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` side chain attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   The options name the product as a derivative of `ethyl propanoate`, meaning the `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` fragment is the parent chain. The entire cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   Let's name this complex substituent according to IUPAC rules. The ring carbon attached to the parent chain (the original C6) is numbered as position 1 of the substituent.\n        *   **Position 1 (original C6):** Has a `methyl` group attached.\n        *   **Position 2 (original C1):** Contains the carbonyl, so it's an `oxo` group.\n        *   **Position 3 (original C2):** Contains an `ethyl` group and a `methyl` group.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent gives **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   This substituent is located on carbon 3 of the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is another Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the nitroalkane to create a nucleophile, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂–NO₂`). The protons on the carbon directly bonded to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, removes an α-proton to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CH–NO₂]⁻`. The α-carbon acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃–CH=CH–CN`).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting molecular skeleton is `(CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂))–(CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)`.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   To name the final product, `CH₃–CH₂–CH(NO₂) –CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN`, we follow IUPAC nomenclature.\n    *   The nitrile (`–CN`) group is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1 and the name will end in `-nitrile`.\n    *   The longest continuous carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. The parent alkane is hexane, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1) to locate the substituents:\n        *   A **methyl** group (`–CH₃`) is on carbon 3.\n        *   A **nitro** group (`–NO₂`) is on carbon 4.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the full name for **Product B**: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Selection**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these determined structures with the given options, only option A provides the correct names for both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reagents:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, non-nucleophilic, sterically hindered base. Its role is to deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone will be deprotonated to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which will be attacked by the enolate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group C=O): C2 and C6.\n        *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n        *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position. This forms a single regioisomer of the enolate, where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 carbon becomes the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, the intermediate enolate is protonated during workup to yield the final product. The ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` chain.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product using IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...substituent...)propanoate`.\n    *   Now, we name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the parent chain is numbered as C1'. To give the principal group on the ring (the keto group) the lowest possible number, we number the ring such that the keto group is at C2'.\n        *   **Attachment point (original C6)** becomes **C1'**. It has a methyl group (`1-methyl`).\n        *   **Carbonyl carbon (original C1)** becomes **C2'** (`2-oxo`).\n        *   **Original C2** becomes **C3'**. It has an ethyl and a methyl group (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these parts alphabetically gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and D, and rules out options B and C.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reagents:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the carbon α to the nitro group.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), which is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group. The α-carbon in 1-nitropropane has two acidic protons.\n    *   The nucleophile is the nitronate anion: `CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. For CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN, the attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH group bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting anion is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon. This chain is 6 carbons long. So the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n        `C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H(NO₂)-C3H(CH₃)-C2H₂-C1N`\n    *   We identify and number the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group at C3 (`3-methyl`).\n        *   A nitro group at C4 (`4-nitro`).\n    *   Combining the names alphabetically gives: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n    *   This is the name for product **B**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options C and D, and rules out options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two correct products leads to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition, a type of conjugate addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 is tertiary and has one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from C-6, forming the corresponding enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate, with its nucleophilic carbon at C-6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n4.  **Product Structure A**: The resulting product is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This specific IUPAC name arises from numbering the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain, where the point of attachment to the ring is C-1 of the substituent.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), creates a nucleophile from 1-nitropropane, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The nitro group (-NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic. KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n4.  **Product Structure B**: After protonation by water, the final product is formed. To name it, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group. This results in a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH₂(C6)-CH(NO₂)(C5)-CH(CH₃)(C4)-CH₂(C3)-CH₂(C2)-CN(C1)\n    *   Let's retrace the IUPAC numbering carefully based on the connectivity: `CN(C1)-CH2(C2)-CH(CH3)(C3)-CH(NO2)(C4)-CH2(C5)-CH3(C6)`.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nMatching these products with the given options leads to the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):** The base used is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong and sterically hindered base. It will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group), so it has no protons to be removed.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a hydrogen and a methyl group). This is the only position where deprotonation can occur.\n    *   The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6, creating a nucleophilic enolate.\n\n2.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The enolate formed at C6 of the cyclohexanone will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** After the nucleophilic attack, the resulting intermediate is protonated to yield the final product, A. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the original ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The structure is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the options, we need to name this structure according to IUPAC rules where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   For naming the substituent, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as C1 of the ring.\n        *   This position (the original C6 of the ketone) has a methyl group, so there is a `1-methyl` substituent.\n        *   The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (original C1) becomes C2, so there is a `2-oxo` substituent.\n        *   The next carbon (original C2) becomes C3, which has both an ethyl and a methyl group, leading to `3-ethyl` and `3-methyl` substituents.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nucleophile):** The base KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane. These protons are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group. This creates the nucleophile `CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`.\n\n2.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, `CH₃CH=CHCN`). The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of this α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, B. A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, the nitrile group (`-CN`) has the highest priority and determines the suffix and numbering of the parent chain. The chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nMatching these two products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\n### Analysis of Reactions\n\nThe user has requested the major products for two separate chemical reactions. Both are examples of the Michael addition reaction.\n\n#### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a base-catalyzed Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no protons to be removed.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6, leading to a single possible enolate structure where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate, with its nucleophilic character at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation during workup, the added group is `–CH2CH2COOEt`.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The final product, **A**, is a cyclohexanone ring with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and the new ethyl propanoate group also at C6. The structure can be named as ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, although this involves an unconventional numbering of the cyclohexyl ring. Based on this analysis, options C and D are incorrect.\n\n#### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is another Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion acts as the Michael donor (nucleophile). The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n2.  **Nucleophile and Electrophile**:\n    *   The nucleophile is the anion of 1-nitropropane: `CH3CH2CH(NO2)⁻`.\n    *   The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile: `CH3CH=CHCN`. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting product has the structure `CH3CH2CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)CH2CN`. To name this compound (**B**), we find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon from the nitrile (CN) group.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile: `CN(1)–CH2(2)–CH(CH3)(3)–CH(NO2)(4)–CH2(5)–CH3(6)`.\n    *   This is a six-carbon chain, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is correctly identified as **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is correctly identified as **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
