    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and the number of its carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde (C₆H₅CH=CHCHO) and methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** The Grignard reagent performs a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. The methyl group (CH₃) attacks the carbonyl carbon, and upon workup, the oxygen is protonated to form a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting product is (E)-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol (C₆H₅CH=CHCH(OH)CH₃).\n*   **Carbon Count:** Product 1 has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the phenyl ring, 2 in the double bond, 1 attached to the hydroxyl group, and 1 in the new methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1, which is a secondary alcohol, and pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).\n*   **Reaction:** PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones without affecting other functional groups like carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Product 2:** The secondary alcohol group in product 1 is oxidized to a ketone, forming (E)-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, also known as benzalacetone. The structure is C₆H₅CH=CHC(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon Count:** This reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms, so product 2 still has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 3: product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2, an α,β-unsaturated ketone, and (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, also known as dimethyloxosulfonium methylide. This is a sulfur ylide used in the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** With α,β-unsaturated ketones, dimethyloxosulfonium methylide selectively adds a methylene group (CH₂) across the carbon-carbon double bond (a 1,4-conjugate addition) to form a cyclopropane ring. This is a key difference from other ylides that might attack the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** The reaction adds a CH₂ group to the C=C double bond of product 2, creating a cyclopropane ring. The final structure is 2-acetyl-1-phenylcyclopropane.\n*   **Carbon Count:** Product 2 had 10 carbon atoms. The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction adds one more carbon atom from the methylene group of the ylide. Therefore, product 3 has a total of 11 carbon atoms.\n\nTo verify, we can count the carbons in the final structure of 2-acetyl-1-phenylcyclopropane:\n*   Phenyl group (C₆H₅): 6 carbons\n*   Cyclopropane ring: 3 carbons\n*   Acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃): 2 carbons\n*   **Total:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\nThus, product 3 contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
