    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must first identify the observational constraints of each instrument and then calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star.\n\n### Observational Constraints\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17.0.\n*   **HIRES (Keck Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16.0.\n*   **Combined Requirement:** For a star to be detectable by both instruments, it must meet the stricter of the two magnitude limits. Therefore, a star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.0.\n*   **Pointing Limits:** The problem explicitly states to disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes, so the declination (celestial latitude) of the stars is not a factor in this analysis.\n\n### Apparent Magnitude Calculations\n\nThe apparent magnitude (V or m) of a star is calculated based on its absolute magnitude (Mv or M), its distance (d) in parsecs, and any interstellar extinction (Av). The general formula is:\nV = Mv - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + Av\n\nIf there is extinction, it is calculated from the color excess E(B-V) using the given coefficient R=3.1, such that Av = 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (Mv) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Extinction (Av) = 0\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (V) = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) = **15.5 mag**\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since 15.5 is less than 16.0, Star 1 is detectable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (V) = **16.5 mag** (given directly)\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since 16.5 is not less than 16.0, Star 2 is too faint for HIRES and thus cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (V) = **15.5 mag** (given directly)\n    *   The additional information about color excess and distance is not needed as the final apparent magnitude is provided.\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since 15.5 is less than 16.0, Star 3 is detectable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (Mv) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Color Excess E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n    *   Extinction (Av) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (V) = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since 16.74 is not less than 16.0, Star 4 is too faint for HIRES and thus cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (Mv) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Extinction (Av) = 0\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (V) = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) â‰ˆ 16.5 - 5 + 3.495 = **14.995 mag**\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since 14.995 is less than 16.0, Star 5 is detectable by both instruments.\n\n### Final Selection\n\nBased on the calculations, Star 1, Star 3, and Star 5 are all bright enough to be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Reviewing the given options, the only pair where both stars are detectable is Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
