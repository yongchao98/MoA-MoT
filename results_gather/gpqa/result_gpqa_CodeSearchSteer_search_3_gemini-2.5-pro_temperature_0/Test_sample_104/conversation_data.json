    "To determine the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl/Rstar), we first need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spotted star. This variation is then equated to the transit depth of an exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Brightness Variation from Star Spots\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing its spotted and unspotted hemispheres. The maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nThe flux emitted per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F = σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (Unspotted Hemisphere):** The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature (Teff = 6000 K).\n    F_max ∝ σ * Teff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (Spotted Hemisphere):** This hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by cooler spots. The visible disk's flux is a combination of the normal photosphere and the spots.\n    *   Temperature of spots, Tspot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   Filling factor of spots, f = 0.20.\n    *   F_min ∝ (1 - f) * σ * Teff⁴ + f * σ * Tspot⁴\n\nThe amplitude of the photometric signal (A) is the fractional drop in flux:\n\nA = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\n\nA = [ σTeff⁴ - ((1-f)σTeff⁴ + fσTspot⁴) ] / (σTeff⁴)\nA = [ fσTeff⁴ - fσTspot⁴ ] / (σTeff⁴)\nA = f * [ 1 - (Tspot/Teff)⁴ ]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nA = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\nA = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\nA = 0.20 * [ 1 - 0.48225 ]\nA = 0.20 * 0.51775\nA ≈ 0.10355\n\n### 2. Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nThe signal from a transiting exoplanet is measured by its transit depth (δ), which is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. This is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nδ = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²) = (Rpl / Rstar)²\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that would produce the same signal amplitude, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude of the starspot variation.\n\n(Rpl / Rstar)² = A\n(Rpl / Rstar)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (Rpl/Rstar):\n\nRpl / Rstar = √0.10355\nRpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
