    "This problem involves the special theory of relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. This distance `d` is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for events occurring in a moving frame compared to the time interval measured within the moving frame itself (`Δt₀`). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    *   `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   Now, use the dilated time to find the distance:\n        `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis calculated distance is very close to option A. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nLet's perform the calculation without intermediate rounding for better precision:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 km`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
