    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary star systems. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nThe formula for the total mass is derived from Kepler's Third Law and is given by:\n\nM_total = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **K1** and **K2** are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For an eclipse to occur, the orbital plane must be aligned very close to our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90 degrees. In this case, sin(i) is approximately 1, and sin³(i) is also approximately 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\nTherefore, the total mass (M) of an eclipsing binary system is directly proportional to its period (P) and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2).\n\nM ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWe can now calculate this value for each system and then find their ratio.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   M1 ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   M2 ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\nTo find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M1 / M2:\n\nRatio = M1 / M2 = (2 * 15³) / (1 * 25³)\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options, the closest value is 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
