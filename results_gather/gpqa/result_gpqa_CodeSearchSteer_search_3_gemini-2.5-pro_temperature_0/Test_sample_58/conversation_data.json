    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   **Reaction:** H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n*   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ remaining:** 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction:** CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n*   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ in excess:** 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Determine the composition of the final solution:**\n\nAfter all reactions are complete, the solution contains:\n*   0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions (a strong base).\n*   0.050 moles of acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n*   Other spectator ions (Cl⁻, Ba²⁺).\n\nThe pH of the solution will be primarily determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻), as its contribution to the hydroxide concentration is far greater than that of the weak base (acetate).\n\n**4. Calculate the final pH:**\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n*   **Concentration of excess OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
