    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). While substitution or simple elimination might be considered, the rigid cage structure of adamantane and the specific reaction conditions often lead to skeletal rearrangements. Reactions of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes are known to proceed through strained intermediates, rearranging to form a protoadamantane skeleton. The spectroscopic data provided (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicating a ketone, and a 14-proton NMR spectrum) are consistent with the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that an alkene (Product 2) must have been formed. This can be explained by a tandem reaction sequence: the aluminum isopropoxide first reduces the ketone to the corresponding alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol), and then the high temperature promotes the dehydration of this alcohol to form an alkene. The most stable alkene formed from the dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol is **protoadamant-4-ene**, as this avoids the formation of a highly strained bridgehead double bond.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the double bond and converts the two carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups. Since both carbons in the double bond of protoadamant-4-ene are bonded to one hydrogen atom, the ozonolysis cleaves the ring to form a single, larger molecule containing two aldehyde groups. The resulting structure is **cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde**.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding any that exchange with a deuterated solvent).\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO). These typically have chemical shifts in the 9-10 ppm range.\n*   **Symmetry:** The product molecule, cis-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxaldehyde, possesses a high degree of symmetry. The two aldehyde groups are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Coupling:** We need to analyze the protons adjacent to one of the aldehyde protons.\n    *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton is separated by three bonds from the proton on the adjacent carbon of the ring (C3 or C7). This carbon (a methine group) has only **one** proton. This coupling will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   **⁴J Coupling (Long-Range):** In rigid bicyclic systems, coupling over four bonds can also be observed. The aldehyde proton can couple with the protons on the next carbons in the ring (C2 and C4, or C6 and C8). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to those on C4. It is expected that the aldehyde proton will show a small, long-range coupling to the **two** equivalent equatorial protons on these carbons, which are in a \"W\" or zig-zag arrangement conducive to ⁴J coupling.\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The primary splitting is into a doublet due to the single adjacent methine proton (³J). Each peak of this doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent long-range coupled protons (⁴J). This results in a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>"
