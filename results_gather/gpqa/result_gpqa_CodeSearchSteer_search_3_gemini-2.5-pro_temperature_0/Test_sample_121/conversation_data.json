    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's structure, followed by an analysis of its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This set of reagents is used for the α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n    *   **Product 1** is 2-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   Product 1 (2-bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   **Product 2** is ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   Product 2 (ethyl 2-bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3** is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (cyano and ester).\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion and forming an intermediate.\n    *   Because excess NaH is used, the α-carbon is deprotonated again. This new carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion.\n    *   This intramolecular cyclization forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4** is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all the protons that are in chemically non-equivalent environments. The question specifies that we should count all *chemically distinct* hydrogens, even if rapid conformational changes might make them appear equivalent in a standard room-temperature NMR spectrum. This means we must consider the protons in a fixed chair conformation, as diastereotopic protons are fundamentally chemically distinct.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry makes pairs of protons equivalent.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons:**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent to each other. This is **Signal 1**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are equivalent to each other. This is **Signal 2**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   In a chair conformation, each carbon (from C2 to C6) has an axial and an equatorial proton. These are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6. However, the axial proton (H_ax) and equatorial proton (H_eq) on C2 are diastereotopic. Therefore, the two axial protons (at C2 and C6) give one signal, and the two equatorial protons give another.\n        *   **Signal 3:** H_ax at C2 and C6.\n        *   **Signal 4:** H_eq at C2 and C6.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. The axial and equatorial protons are distinct.\n        *   **Signal 5:** H_ax at C3 and C5.\n        *   **Signal 6:** H_eq at C3 and C5.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. They are not equivalent to any other protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Signal 7:** H_ax at C4.\n        *   **Signal 8:** H_eq at C4.\n\nCounting these distinct sets gives a total of 8 signals.\n\n*   **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n*   **6 signals** from the cyclohexane ring.\n\nTotal = 2 + 6 = **8** distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<B>>>"
