    "The number of loops in the Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression provided. The key lies in a specific factor within the string of terms.\n\nIn quantum field theory, when calculating the value of a Feynman diagram, each closed loop requires an integration over the momentum circulating within it. In a four-dimensional spacetime, using a common regularization technique known as dimensional regularization, each of these loop integrals contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(4π)²` (or `1/(16π²)`) to the final expression for the diagram's amplitude.\n\nThe scribbled note contains the factor `1/(4π)⁶`. By analyzing this term, we can deduce the number of loops:\n\n`1/(4π)⁶ = (1/(4π)²)³`\n\nThe exponent, 3, directly corresponds to the number of loops in the Feynman diagram. While other terms in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`α³` and `g²`), relate to the number and type of interaction vertices, the power of the `1/(4π)²` factor is the most direct indicator of the loop count.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
