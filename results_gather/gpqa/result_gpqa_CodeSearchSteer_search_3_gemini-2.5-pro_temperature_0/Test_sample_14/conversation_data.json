    "The search results confirm the formulas used in the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Transit Probability:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit is the ratio of the stellar radius (R_star) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). This is often expressed as P_transit ≈ R_star / a.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_star). This can be written as P² ∝ a³ / M_star, which rearranges to a³ ∝ P² * M_star.\n\nThe initial derivation was as follows:\n\n1.  The ratio of the transit probabilities is:\n    Ratio = P_transit(Planet_1) / P_transit(Planet_2) = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n\n2.  Given that the stellar radii are the same (R_s1 = R_s2), the ratio simplifies to:\n    Ratio = a2 / a1\n\n3.  Using Kepler's Third Law (a ∝ (P² * M_star)^(1/3)), the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    a1 / a2 = [(P1² * M_s1) / (P2² * M_s2)]^(1/3)\n\n4.  Substituting the given relationships (P1 = P2 / 3 and M_s1 = 2 * M_s2):\n    a1 / a2 = [((P2 / 3)² * (2 * M_s2)) / (P2² * M_s2)]^(1/3)\n    a1 / a2 = [(P2² / 9 * 2 * M_s2) / (P2² * M_s2)]^(1/3)\n    a1 / a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)\n\n5.  The ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    Ratio = a2 / a1 = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n6.  Calculating the final value:\n    (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 is preferred because it has an approximately 1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. This matches option C.\n\nFinal check of the logic and calculations confirms the result. No further information is needed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
