    "The angle between the directions of the two photons produced in the electron-positron annihilation is approximately 138 degrees. This result is derived from the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in relativistic kinematics.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum\n\nFirst, we determine the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. The energy (E) and momentum (p) of a particle with rest mass (m) and Lorentz factor (γ) are given by the relations E = γmc² and E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   **Electron (moving from the left):**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Energy (E_e) = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Momentum (p_e) can be found from the energy-momentum relation: (p_e*c)² = E_e² - (m_e*c²)² = (4m_e*c²)² - (m_e*c²)² = 15(m_e*c²)². Thus, p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e*c. This momentum is in the positive horizontal direction.\n\n*   **Positron (moving from the right):**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Energy (E_p) = 2 * m_e * c² (The positron has the same rest mass as the electron).\n    *   Momentum (p_p) is calculated similarly: (p_p*c)² = E_p² - (m_e*c²)² = (2m_e*c²)² - (m_e*c²)² = 3(m_e*c²)². Thus, p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e*c. This momentum is in the negative horizontal direction.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   Total Energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = 4m_e*c² + 2m_e*c² = 6m_e*c².\n    *   Total Momentum (P_initial) = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c along the horizontal axis.\n\n### 2. Final State: Photon Properties\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n\n*   The problem states the two photons have equal energy (E_γ).\n*   From the conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final => 6m_e*c² = 2 * E_γ.\n*   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_γ = 3m_e*c².\n*   The momentum of a photon is given by p_γ = E_γ / c. So, the momentum of each photon is p_γ = 3m_e*c.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Momentum and Angle Calculation\n\nThe total momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial system has momentum only along the horizontal (x-axis). This means the vertical components (y-axis) of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) to the horizontal axis.\n\n*   The horizontal component of the final momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum: P_final_x = p_γ*cos(θ) + p_γ*cos(-θ) = 2*p_γ*cos(θ).\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c = 2 * (3m_e*c) * cos(θ)\n*   Simplifying the equation to solve for the angle θ:\n    cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n*   Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732:\n    cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   Solving for θ gives:\n    θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees.\n\nThe angle *between* the two photons is 2θ.\n\n*   Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138 degrees.\n\n<<<D>>>"
