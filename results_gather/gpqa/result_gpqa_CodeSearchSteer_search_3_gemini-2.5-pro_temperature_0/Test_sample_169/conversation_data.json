    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state vector.**\n    The given unnormalized spin state is |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). To normalize it, we first find the square of its norm, which is the inner product of the state with itself, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of the ket |ψ⟩, so ⟨ψ| = (-3i, 4).\n\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\n    The normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    The normalized state is |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * (3i, 4).\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y.**\n    The spin operator S_y is defined in terms of the Pauli matrix σ_y and the reduced Planck constant ħ:\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\n\n    Given the matrix for σ_y:\n    σ_y =\n    ( 0  -i )\n    ( i   0 )\n\n    So, S_y = (ħ/2) *\n               ( 0  -i )\n               ( i   0 )\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ_norm|S_y|ψ_norm⟩.\n\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * (-3i, 4) * [ (ħ/2) * ( 0  -i ) ] * [ (1/5) * ( 3i ) ]\n                                         ( i   0 )           ( 4  )\n\n    First, let's factor out the constants (1/5 * 1/5 * ħ/2 = ħ/50):\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * (-3i, 4) * [ ( 0  -i ) * ( 3i ) ]\n                                 [ ( i   0 )   ( 4  ) ]\n\n    Next, perform the matrix-vector multiplication:\n    [ ( 0  -i ) * ( 3i ) ] = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = [ -4i ]\n    [ ( i   0 )   ( 4  ) ]   [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]   [ 3i² ] = [ -3 ]\n\n    Now, substitute this back and perform the inner product:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * (-3i, 4) * ( -4i )\n                               ( -3  )\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [12i² - 12]\n    Since i² = -1:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-12 - 12]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-24]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ / 50\n\n    Simplifying the fraction gives:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
