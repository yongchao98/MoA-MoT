    "This is a problem about the probability of radioactive decay, which is a memoryless process. The fact that the atom has not decayed for the first 50 minutes does not affect its probability of decaying in the future. The probability of decay depends only on the length of the time interval.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the decay constant (λ) from the information given. The probability that an atom survives for a time *t* is given by the formula P(survival) = e^(-λt).\n\n1.  **Use the given data to find the decay constant (λ):**\n    *   The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   This means the probability of the atom *not* decaying (surviving) within 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Using the survival formula: 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).\n    *   To solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ.\n    *   So, λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    *   Because the process is memoryless, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in any 150-minute interval.\n    *   The probability of the atom *not* decaying in 150 minutes is P(survival) = e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   Substitute the expression for λ from step 1: P(survival) = e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150).\n    *   This simplifies to: P(survival) = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = e^(ln(0.68^1.5)) = 0.68^1.5.\n    *   Calculating the value: 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n    *   This is the probability of survival. The probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival.\n    *   P(decay in 150 minutes) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n\n3.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%.\n    *   This value is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
