    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. According to the Born rule in quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. This is calculated by integrating the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density, |Ψ(x)|², is found by multiplying the wave function by its complex conjugate, Ψ*(x).\nΨ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x) = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\n|Ψ(x)|² = ( a² / (1 + x) ) - (0.5i)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = ( a² / (1 + x) ) - (0.25 * -1)\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the normalization integral is set up over this interval:\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\n∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25x\n\nEvaluating the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x ] from 1 to 3\n\n= [a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n\nSet the result equal to 1:\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) = 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\nNow, solve for \"a\":\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\nUsing the approximation ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
