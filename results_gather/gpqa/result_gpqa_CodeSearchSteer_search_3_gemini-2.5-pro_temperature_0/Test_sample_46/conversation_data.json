    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and IR Spectrum\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal, a triplet integrating to three hydrogens, suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two hydrogens is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, such as an oxygen in an ester (-COOCH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to an ester oxygen.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two hydrogens is a classic signal for the protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two hydrogens, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### 3. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined data:\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The NMR data confirms a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. The spectroscopic data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate found in literature is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Other Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amine (would show one N-H band in IR) and an amide, which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl around 2.2-2.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR than two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data uniquely identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
