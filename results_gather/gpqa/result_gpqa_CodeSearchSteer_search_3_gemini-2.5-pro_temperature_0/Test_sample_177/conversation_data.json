    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant Îº and the renormalizability of the theory, we must analyze the given Lagrangian interaction term:\n\n\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\n\n### 1. Determining Mass Dimensions\n\nIn natural units (where \\(\\hbar = c = 1\\)), the action \\(S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}\\) is dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of \\([d^4x] = M^{-4}\\), the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of \\(M^4\\). This means every term in the Lagrangian, including \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\), must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\nWe need to find the mass dimensions of the fields and operators in the interaction term:\n*   **Fermion field \\(\\psi\\):** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is \\(\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of \\(M^4\\), and knowing that the derivative \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) has a dimension of \\(M^1\\), the fermion field \\(\\psi\\) (and \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\)) must have a mass dimension of \\(M^{3/2}\\).\n*   **Field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this to have a mass dimension of \\(M^4\\), the field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) must have a mass dimension of \\(M^2\\).\n*   **Sigma tensor \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\):** This is defined as \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}]\\). The gamma matrices \\(\\gamma_\\mu\\) are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless, having a mass dimension of \\(M^0\\).\n\nNow, we can determine the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) by ensuring the total dimension of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) is \\(M^4\\):\n\\[[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^0 \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^2 = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] \\cdot M^3 \\cdot M^2 = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] = M^{-1}\\]\nThe mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\n### 2. Determining Renormalizability\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimensions of its coupling constants. The general criteria are as follows:\n*   **Renormalizable:** The coupling constant is dimensionless (mass dimension 0).\n*   **Super-renormalizable:** The coupling constant has a positive mass dimension.\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** The coupling constant has a negative mass dimension.\n\nSince the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, the theory described by this interaction is **non-renormalizable**. Non-renormalizable theories typically lose predictive power at high energies because an infinite number of counterterms are required to cancel divergences that appear at higher orders in perturbation theory.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
