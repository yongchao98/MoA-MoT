    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first calculate the energy of the transition from the molecule's fundamental (ground) state to the next state with the lowest possible energy.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Vibrational Energy:** Eᵥ = ħω(v + 1/2), where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **Rotational Energy:** Eⱼ = B·J(J + 1), where `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), and B is the rotational constant, B = ħ² / (2I).\n*   **Total Energy:** E(v,J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\n*   **Initial State:** The fundamental, or ground, state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers: v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   **Final State:** The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" Since the problem provides the vibrational frequency (ω), it implies we should consider a rovibrational transition, where both `v` and `J` change. The selection rules for an absorption transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition that adheres to these rules is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot be negative).\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from **(v=0, J=0)** to **(v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):**\n    E(0,0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):**\n    E(1,1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nSince B = ħ² / (2I), we can write this as:\nΔE = ħω + ħ² / I\n\n### 4. Calculating Physical Constants\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass (μ) and the moment of inertia (I) of the molecule.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Mass of atom X (Mₓ): 20 amu\n    *   Mass of atom Y (Mᵧ): 2 amu\n    *   Bond length (R): 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Angular frequency (ω): 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Atomic mass unit (amu): 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant (ħ): 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Speed of light (c): 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mₓ * Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μ * R² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy of the transition.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    ΔE_vib = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (ħ²/I):**\n    ΔE_rot = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   **Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\nFinally, we calculate the photon's momentum (p) using the energy-momentum relation for a photon, p = E/c.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (p):**\n    p = ΔE / c = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n<<<D>>>"
