    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial conditions and conservation laws\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2` and kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n    *   From the problem statement, `m1` is the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after.\n        `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n        `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments and the total kinetic energy\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n*   We have `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   Substituting this into `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, we get `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   And `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (`Q-value`) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies:\n*   `T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1=p2`), we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\nThis leads to the relation: `(p*c)^2 = T * (T + 2*m*c^2)`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nWe substitute the known values (all in GeV):\n*   `T2 = 3 - T1`\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n*   `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classically calculated value is:\n*   `Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
