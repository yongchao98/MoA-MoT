    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we can use the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanet detection.\n\n### Analysis of the Radial Velocity Method\n\nThe RV method relies on detecting the Doppler shift in a star's spectral lines, which is caused by the star \"wobbling\" as it is gravitationally pulled by an orbiting planet. The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum observed radial velocity is known as the semi-amplitude, K.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n*   The wavelength shift for the star hosting planet #1 is Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n*   The wavelength shift for the star hosting planet #2 is Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n\nSince the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the wavelength shift Δλ, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Period\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (mₚ), the star's mass (Mₛ), and the orbital period (T) by the following formula. A simplified and proportional relationship when other factors are constant is K ∝ mₚ / (Mₛ²/³ * T¹/³).\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The stars have identical masses (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n*   The planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂).\n*   Both orbits are circular.\n\nA necessary assumption for this problem is that the orbital inclinations (i) relative to our line of sight are the same for both systems. With these conditions, the masses (mₚ and Mₛ) become constant factors in the comparison.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (T) simplifies to:\nK ∝ 1 / T¹/³\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can set up a ratio for the two planetary systems:\nK₂ / K₁ = (1 / T₂¹/³) / (1 / T₁¹/³) = (T₁ / T₂)¹/³\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the orbital periods, T₂ / T₁. We can rearrange the equation:\nT₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nNow, we substitute the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes we found earlier (K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7):\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This aligns with the intuitive understanding that a larger stellar wobble (higher K) is caused by a planet that is, among other possibilities, in a closer and therefore shorter-period orbit.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
