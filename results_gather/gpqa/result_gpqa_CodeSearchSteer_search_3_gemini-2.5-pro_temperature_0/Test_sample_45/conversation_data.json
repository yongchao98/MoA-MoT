    "The treatment of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst results in a self-metathesis reaction. This reaction joins two molecules of the starting alkene to form a new, larger alkene and ethene. The key to determining the number of products is to analyze the stereochemistry of the reaction.\n\n**1. Reactants and Reaction:**\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is a racemic mixture, which means it contains equal amounts of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n*   **Catalyst:** Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis.\n*   **Reaction:** The self-metathesis of two molecules of 3-methylpent-1-ene (CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃) produces 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene and ethene (CH₂=CH₂).\n\n**2. Product Structure:**\nThe main product, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (at carbons 3 and 6) and a central double bond (between carbons 4 and 5) that can exist as either an E (trans) or Z (cis) isomer.\n\n**3. Possible Reactant Pairings:**\nSince the starting material is a racemic mixture of the (R) and (S) enantiomers, three different reaction pairings can occur:\n*   (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene\n*   (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n*   (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n\n**4. Analysis of Products from Each Pairing:**\n\n*   **(R) + (R) pairing:** This reaction produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Because of the E/Z isomerism at the double bond, two distinct products (diastereomers) are formed:\n    1.  (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n    2.  (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n*   **(S) + (S) pairing:** This reaction produces (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, two diastereomers are possible, which are the enantiomers of the products from the (R) + (R) reaction:\n    3.  (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of product 1)\n    4.  (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of product 2)\n\n*   **(R) + (S) pairing (Cross-Metathesis):** This reaction produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The stereochemical outcome for the E and Z isomers is different:\n    5.  **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule possesses a center of inversion, making it an achiral meso compound.\n    6.  **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry, which makes it chiral.\n\nIn total, these three reaction pathways result in six chemically distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
