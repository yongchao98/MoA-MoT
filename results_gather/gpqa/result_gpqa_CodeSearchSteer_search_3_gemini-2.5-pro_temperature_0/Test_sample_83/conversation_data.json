    "When solving partial differential equations like the heat equation numerically, a common approach is to discretize the spatial dimensions, which transforms the PDE into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The solution to this system involves a matrix exponential function. For computational efficiency, this exponential function is often approximated by a rational function (a fraction of two polynomials), such as a Pad√© approximation.\n\nThe key to converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one lies in the ability to split the problem into smaller, independent tasks that can be solved simultaneously on different processors. This is achieved by decomposing the rational approximation of the matrix exponential into its linear partial fractions.\n\nThis decomposition allows a single, large, complex system to be broken down into several smaller, independent linear systems. Each of these smaller systems can then be assigned to a separate processor, enabling parallel computation and significantly speeding up the solution time.\n\nTherefore, the other options are less central to the act of parallelization itself:\n*   **A) Stability analysis:** This is crucial for any numerical algorithm (both sequential and parallel) to ensure that errors do not grow uncontrollably, but it is not the mechanism that enables parallelism.\n*   **C) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The nature of the roots affects the properties of the method, but the decomposition into partial fractions is the direct enabler of the parallel split, regardless of whether the roots are real or complex.\n*   **D) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** These conditions typically make a problem *more difficult* to parallelize because they create dependencies across the computational domain.\n\n<<<B>>>"
