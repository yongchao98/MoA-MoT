    "An N-sided regular polygon with an apothem of length 'a' will approach a circular aperture of radius 'a' as the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large. The problem, therefore, reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nWhen monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the diffraction intensity.\n\nThe angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind. For small angles, the condition for the minima is given by:\n\nθ = m * (λ / D)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the circular aperture (D = 2a).\n*   m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nFor the first minimum, the coefficient m is approximately 1.220. The angular position is:\nθ₁ ≈ 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a.\n\nFor the second minimum, the coefficient m is approximately 2.233. The angular position is:\nθ₂ ≈ 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.117 * λ / a.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.117 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.507 * λ / a\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
