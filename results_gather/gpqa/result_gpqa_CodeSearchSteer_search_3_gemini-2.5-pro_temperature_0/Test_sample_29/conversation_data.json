    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first calculate the wavelength of the emitted light and identify its color. The absorbed color will be the complementary color to the emitted color.\n\n**1. Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light**\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) in electron volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is approximated by the formula:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / E\n\nPlugging in the given energy:\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\nλ ≈ 530.07 nm\n\n**2. Determine the Color of Emitted Light**\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n**3. Identify the Absorbed (Complementary) Color**\nThe color an object appears to be is the result of the wavelengths of light it reflects or transmits, while it absorbs the other colors. The color that is absorbed is the complementary color to the one we see. In this case, since the dye emits green light, it must absorb the complementary color of green. The complementary color to green is red.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
