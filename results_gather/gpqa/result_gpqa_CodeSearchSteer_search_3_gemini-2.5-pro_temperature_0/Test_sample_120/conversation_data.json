    "The reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction follows a set of predictable rules regarding its regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, which are key to determining the final product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are also methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 with the specified R/S configurations.\n    *   **Reagent**: Me2CuLi (a Gilman reagent) provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me-).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are considered \"soft\" nucleophiles. In reactions with epoxides, they preferentially attack the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n    *   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The ring-opening of epoxides by organocuprates proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material. Due to the SN2 inversion, its configuration in the product will become (R).\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained, so it remains (R).\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations also remain (R).\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n\n1.  **Structure**: The reaction adds a new methyl group to C6 and creates a hydroxyl group at C1. The product is therefore a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Naming**: To name the product, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   The original C1 (now with an -OH and a methyl group) is the new C1.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (the newly added one), 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give methyl groups at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is preferred as it is lower. Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n3.  **Final Stereochemistry**:\n    *   **Product C1** (from reactant C1): Configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **Product C2** (from reactant C6): Configuration inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   **Product C4** (from reactant C4): Configuration is retained as (R).\n    *   **Product C5** (from reactant C3): Configuration is retained as (R).\n\nCombining these assignments, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
