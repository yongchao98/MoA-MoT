    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption from ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff for ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength (λ₀):** This is a spectral line of neutral hydrogen with a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength falls within the vacuum ultraviolet part of the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation. This makes ground-based observations at these wavelengths very difficult. The practical cutoff for ground-based telescopes is around 3200 Å (320 nm). Below this wavelength, atmospheric transmission drops significantly, rendering observations impossible. Some specialized instruments, like the upcoming CUBES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), are optimized for the near-UV range of 300-400 nm (3000-4000 Å).\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The redshift (z) describes how much the light from a distant object has been stretched to longer wavelengths by the expansion of the universe. The relationship between the rest wavelength (λ₀) and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is given by the formula:\n\n    λ_obs = λ₀ * (1 + z)\n\n    For the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable from the ground, its observed wavelength (λ_obs) must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n\n    λ_obs > 3200 Å\n\n    Substituting the values:\n\n    1216 Å * (1 + z) > 3200 Å\n\n    1 + z > 3200 / 1216\n\n    1 + z > 2.63\n\n    z > 1.63\n\nTherefore, the redshift of the absorbing cloud must be greater than approximately 1.63 for the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line to be shifted into the observable optical window. Some sources directly state that direct ground-based observations of neutral hydrogen via the Lyman-alpha transition are restricted to redshifts of z ≳ 1.7.\n\nComparing this calculated lower limit with the given options:\n*   A) 3\n*   B) 1.9\n*   C) 2.4\n*   D) 1.2\n\nThe value 1.2 is below the calculated limit. The values 1.9, 2.4, and 3 are all above the limit. The question asks for the *lower limit* among the choices provided that is physically viable. The lowest option that is safely above the calculated physical limit of z > 1.63 is 1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
