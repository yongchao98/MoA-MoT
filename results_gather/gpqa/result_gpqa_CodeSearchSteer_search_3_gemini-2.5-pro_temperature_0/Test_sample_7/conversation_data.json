    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Data\n\n1.  **Role of G2:** The single knock-out mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of the wild-type phenotype. Furthermore, any double-mutant combination including `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also results in 0% resistance. This pattern is characteristic of epistasis, where the `g2` mutation masks the effects of the `g1` and `g3` mutations. In a genetic pathway, the gene that is epistatic to others is often upstream. Given that at least one gene is a transcription factor, and the knockout of a key transcription factor can shut down an entire pathway, G2 is the strongest candidate for the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Relationship between G1 and G3:**\n    *   The `g1` single mutant loses some resistance (75% remaining).\n    *   The `g3` single mutant loses more resistance (50% remaining).\n    *   The `g1g3` double mutant has a resistance level of 10%. This phenotype is much more severe than either of the single mutant phenotypes and also more severe than a simple additive effect (where one might expect 100% - 25% loss - 50% loss = 25% remaining resistance).\n    *   This synergistic interaction, where the combined effect of two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects, is a hallmark of gene redundancy. It implies that G1 and G3 have partially overlapping functions; the organism can compensate for the loss of one, but losing both is devastating to the resistance phenotype.\n\n3.  **Epistasis between G1 and G3:** The term epistasis describes a situation where one gene's phenotype masks another's. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` double mutant's phenotype (10% resistance) would need to be the same as the `g1` single mutant's phenotype (75% resistance). This is not the case. Therefore, based on the standard definition, G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. The experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so no conclusion can be made about pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits). Also, G1 is not epistatic towards G3.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and correctly interprets the synergistic effect on the `g1g3` mutant as gene redundancy. Although the claim that \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is not supported by the data, the first two statements are strongly supported and are the most accurate descriptions of the primary interactions observed. Among the given choices, this is the best possible conclusion.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. We cannot determine if the genes share a promoter from this data. Also, G3 is not epistatic towards G1.\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. G1 is unlikely to be the primary transcription factor because the `g1` mutant has a weaker phenotype than the `g2` mutant. As with option A, pleiotropy cannot be determined.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most accurate conclusion based on the experimental data is that G2 acts as an upstream transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are partially redundant genes in the resistance pathway it regulates. Option B is the only one that captures these two key points.\n\n<<<B>>>"
