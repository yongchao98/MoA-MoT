    "This problem can be solved by using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Particle Survival Equation**: The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the detector's reference frame is given by the exponential decay law. This law must account for time dilation, where the particle's internal clock runs slower. The formula is:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    where:\n    *   `t` is the time of flight in the detector's frame.\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   `τ` (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n2.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel from the center to the wall of the spherical detector, a distance equal to the radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the time of flight `t` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c = 30 / c`\n\n3.  **Setting up the Ratios**: Let's analyze the two scenarios given in the problem. The term `(R/c) / τ` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The survival equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles survive, so `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2**: We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles survive, so `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknown**: We can solve for `γ₂` by first finding the constant `K` from Scenario 1.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `K` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculation**: Now, we calculate the numerical value.\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
