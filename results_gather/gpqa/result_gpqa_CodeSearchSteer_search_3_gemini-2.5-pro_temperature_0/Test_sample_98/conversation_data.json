    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**: The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of a carboxylic acid. These two pieces of information strongly suggest the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The ¹H NMR data is crucial for determining the carbon skeleton of the molecule. The absence of signals for vinyl hydrogens confirms that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures. The key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (n=1, giving a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving a triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (n=3, giving a quartet). The total number of neighboring protons is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (n=1, giving a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving a triplet), and another, different set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving another triplet). The total number of neighboring protons is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n### Evaluation of Potential Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each of the candidate molecules to see which one would produce both of these specific splitting patterns. We will label the backbone carbons starting with the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the proton on C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and its own methyl group (3H). This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H) would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors consisting of one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons. Thus, it cannot produce a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), the proton on C4 (1H), and its own methyl group (3H). This environment would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   Similar to structure B, there is no proton environment that would lead to a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the proton on C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H). This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H) would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has the correct set of neighbors (1H, 2H, and 3H) to produce a **dtq** signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**:\n    *   Let's analyze the protons on the main chain: `CH₃(C6)-CH(C5)(C₂H₅)-CH(C4)(C₂H₅)-CH(C3)₂-COOH(C1)`\n    *   **Proton on C4**: This proton is adjacent to the proton on C5 (1H), the CH₂ group at C3 (2H), and the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton on C5**: This proton is adjacent to the proton on C4 (1H), the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H), and the terminal CH₃ group at C6 (3H). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly structure A, 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid, has protons in two different locations that perfectly match the described complex splitting patterns of both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n\n<<<A>>>"
