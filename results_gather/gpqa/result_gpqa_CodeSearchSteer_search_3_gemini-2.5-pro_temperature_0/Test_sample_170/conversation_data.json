    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer.\n\nHere is a substance-by-substance analysis based on the directing effects of their functional groups:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer. The strength of the deactivating effect influences the selectivity for the meta position; stronger deactivators yield even less para-product.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong deactivator and meta-director. Bromination of nitrobenzene almost exclusively yields the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer. Theoretical calculations show the para intermediate is significantly less stable than the meta intermediate.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivator and meta-director. Its deactivating effect is less than the nitro group, so it will produce a slightly higher, yet still very small, yield of the para-isomer compared to nitrobenzene.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is also a deactivating meta-director. It is generally considered a weaker deactivator than a carboxylic acid. For instance, in nitration reactions, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para-isomer. This is expected to be the highest para yield among the three meta-directors.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (Activating/Deactivating):** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para products is largely determined by steric hindrance.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-director. For bromination, the typical distribution gives a significant amount of para-isomer, around 33-40%.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho, para-director, similar to the methyl group. However, the ethyl group is larger, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the para position, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is an ortho, para-director due to its lone pairs of electrons. Halogens are known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene can yield up to 87% of the para-isomer, which is the highest among this set of ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Summary of Isomer Yields:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the following order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Lowest para yield due to the strongly deactivating -NO₂ group.\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para yield, but slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Low para yield, but the most of the meta-directors.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Significant para yield (~33-40%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Highest para yield (~87%) due to the electronic properties of the chloro substituent.\n\nTherefore, the final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe correct sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
