    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must first establish the instrument's capabilities and the properties of each star. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved in a one-hour exposure using a single 8.2m VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode).\n\n### ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude\n\nThe European Southern Observatory (ESO) provides information on ESPRESSO's performance. For the 1-UT mode, which utilizes one of the VLT's 8m telescopes, ESPRESSO can reach a limiting V-band magnitude of approximately 16 to 17 to achieve a S/N of 10 in a one-hour exposure. This is dependent on the binning mode used; for instance, the HR21 mode has a limiting magnitude of about V ~ 16. We will use V = 16 as a conservative threshold for detectability.\n\n### Star Properties and Observability from Paranal\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern location restricts the visibility of stars in the far northern sky. A star's declination (DEC) must be greater than approximately -65 degrees and less than about +65 degrees to be observable from Paranal.\n\nHere is an analysis of each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** -0.74.\n*   **Declination:** Approximately -52° 42'.\n*   **Analysis:** With a declination of -52° 42', Canopus is easily observable from Paranal. Its apparent magnitude of -0.74 is significantly brighter than the V=16 limit.\n*   **Detectable:** Yes.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** +1.98.\n*   **Declination:** Approximately +89° 16'.\n*   **Analysis:** Polaris has a declination very close to the north celestial pole. From Paranal's southern latitude, Polaris is never visible as it does not rise above the horizon.\n*   **Detectable:** No.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance.**\n*   **Calculation:** The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula: m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5.\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** 15.\n*   **Declination:** 0°.\n*   **Analysis:** A declination of 0° means the star is on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal. Its apparent magnitude of 15 is within the V=16 detection limit of ESPRESSO.\n*   **Detectable:** Yes.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance.**\n*   **Calculation:** m = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.301 - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** 21.5.\n*   **Declination:** 0°.\n*   **Analysis:** While observable due to its declination, its apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the V=16 limit.\n*   **Detectable:** No.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance.**\n*   **Calculation:** m = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** 13.5.\n*   **Declination:** 0°.\n*   **Analysis:** The star is observable from Paranal. Its apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the V=16 limit.\n*   **Detectable:** Yes.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance.**\n*   **Calculation:** m = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.699 - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** 18.5.\n*   **Declination:** 0°.\n*   **Analysis:** The star is observable from Paranal, but its apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the V=16 limit.\n*   **Detectable:** No.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the following stars would be detectable:\n1.  Canopus (V = -0.74, observable)\n2.  Star c (V = 15, observable)\n3.  Star e (V = 13.5, observable)\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 stars from the list would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the specified conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
