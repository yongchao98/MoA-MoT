    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow a two-step process involving the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, and then Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / √a\n\nwhere:\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light reflected).\n*   `a` is the orbital distance from the star.\n\nSince the problem states that the albedo is the same for all three planets, the (1 - A) term is constant and can be disregarded when taking ratios. This simplifies the relationship to:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of temperatures between two planets (Planet_x and Planet_y) is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances:\n\nT_x / T_y = √(a_y / a_x)\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3) ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing these, we can find the ratios of their orbital distances:\n*   For Planet1 and Planet2: 1.4 = √(a2 / a1)  =>  a2 / a1 = 1.4² = 1.96\n*   For Planet2 and Planet3: 2.3 = √(a3 / a2)  =>  a3 / a2 = 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distances between Planet3 and Planet1 (a3 / a1), we multiply the two ratios:\n\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.37\n\n**2. Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, this can be expressed as a ratio:\n\n(P_x / P_y)² = (a_x / a_y)³\n\nFrom this, we can derive the relationship for the orbital periods:\n\nP_x / P_y = (a_x / a_y)^(3/2)\n\nWe want to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio P3 / P1. Using the orbital distance ratio we calculated:\n\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) ≈ (10.37)^(1.5)\n\nCalculating this value:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.42\n\nThis result is approximately 33.4. The information provided about the planetary masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation, assuming the planets' masses are negligible compared to their star's mass, which is a standard assumption in such problems.\n\n<<<A>>>"
