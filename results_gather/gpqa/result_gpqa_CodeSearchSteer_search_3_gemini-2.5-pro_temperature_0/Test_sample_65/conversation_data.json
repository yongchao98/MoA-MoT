    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory. This imposes certain fundamental symmetries that all operators within the theory must respect.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** SMEFT is built upon the principles of special relativity. Therefore, all operators must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and, more generally, Poincare transformations, which also include spacetime translations. The requirement of Lorentz invariance is fundamental to having a consistent theory with massless spin-1 particles like the photon and gluon.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory, stating that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is symmetric under the combined operations of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT adheres to these conditions, all its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** Unlike the other symmetries, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, notably in the weak interactions. SMEFT, as an extension of the SM, provides a framework to parameterize these known violations as well as potential new sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model. There are numerous studies dedicated to classifying and identifying the many CP-violating operators that can exist in SMEFT at various mass dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
