    "To determine the correct pair of compounds, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option and see which one matches the provided data.\n\n**Given Spectral Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in a single signal, a **singlet**, for these 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This results in a single signal, a **singlet**, for all 12 protons.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 1 proton.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** for these 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6 protons (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, resulting in **one singlet** for 4 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a CH2 group and a CH3 group, which would appear as a **quartet and a triplet**, respectively, due to spin-spin splitting. This contradicts the problem description, which specifies only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the 1:1 mixture for each option:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound and two 1H signals from the second), which does not match the two singlets observed.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This combination would also result in three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides another 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** of equal integration, matching the **1:1 ratio** described.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combination in the mixture gives three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This corresponds to a **2:1:1 ratio**, which perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
