    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n### 1. Chemical Reaction and Equilibrium Constant\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this formation (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given as 5.0 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe problem involves a solution of the complex, which will dissociate to a small extent. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n### 2. Setting up the Calculation\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentrations of the species. Let 'x' be the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions that form from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n\n*   **Change in Concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = +x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n\n*   **Equilibrium Concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n### 3. Solving for the Calcium Ion Concentration\n\nThe formation constant expression is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation of the complex will be minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nWe can now solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻²) / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\nx = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option D. The assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is validated by the result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
