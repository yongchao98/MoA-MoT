    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and does not possess any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters using (R) and (S) notations. This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific stereoisomer that is chiral. As a chiral molecule, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite the presence of chiral centers and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, and the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image (the (2S, 3S) isomer). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, and two different paths around the ring). Since a specific chiral enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
