    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness is due to hydrogen bonding. This strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this points strongly to a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. This piece of data provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation**\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. Let's calculate this for the two most likely options (those with two oxygens, as suggested by the carboxylic acid group):\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (B):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 1 would account for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid, but it does not account for the C=C double bond confirmed by both FTIR and 1H NMR.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (D):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 2 perfectly matches the evidence: one degree for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and a second degree for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll three analytical techniques point to a single conclusion. The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The only molecular formula that accommodates both of these features (requiring two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
