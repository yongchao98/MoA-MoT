    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂:\n\nM₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n**pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])**\n\n*   **Ka of acetic acid:** 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   **pKa:** -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt this point, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n\n*   [A⁻] = 25%\n*   [HA] = 100% - 25% = 75%\n*   **Ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:** 25 / 75 = 1/3\n\nNow, plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\npH = 4.733 - log(3)\npH = 4.733 - 0.477\n**pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (a weak base).\n\n**CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n\n*   **Moles of acetic acid:** M_acid × V_acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 moles\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added (V_eq):** Moles / M_base = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate [A⁻]:** Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\nNext, we calculate the concentration of OH⁻ produced by the hydrolysis of acetate. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n\n*   **Kw (ion-product constant for water at 25 °C):** 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   **Kb:** Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\nx² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nFinally, we calculate the pOH and then the pH.\n\n*   **pOH:** -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   **pH:** 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<D>>>"
