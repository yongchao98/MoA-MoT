    "The problem requires identifying the correct stereoisomers of a starting material that lead to specific stereoisomers of a product after reduction with two different reagents.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The options provide the name as (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to the structure HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu, where the chiral center is at carbon 3.\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone, which is formed from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center at C3 of the starting acid becomes C4 in the lactone, and its stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction sequences described.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    The product of this step is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n\nSince the reactions do not affect the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nThus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, it will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    The product of this step is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to Reaction A, the stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
