    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFirst, let's establish the energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a given quantum state 'n' is:\n\nE_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n\nE_n = n² * E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n### Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nSince the particles are spin-1/2 particles (fermions), they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level 'n' and the spin projection (spin up or spin down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculating the System Energies\n\nWe will now fill the energy levels with the four particles to find the total energy for the ground and excited states.\n\n**Ground State (Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up:\n*   **n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**First Excited State**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state configuration to the next available unoccupied energy level. This corresponds to promoting one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1E):** Two particles.\n*   **n=2 (Energy E₂ = 4E):** One particle.\n*   **n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E):** One particle.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\nE_1st_excited = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**Second Excited State**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Promote the other particle from n=2 to n=3: (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n2.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4: (2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n3.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3: (1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest energy configuration after the first excited state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
