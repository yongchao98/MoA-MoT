    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor will attract free electrons from the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a net charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially electrically neutral, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) do not produce an electric field outside the conductor. Similarly, the charge on the outer surface does not create a field inside the conductor's material.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges within the cavity, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (a principle derived from Gauss's Law, also known as the Shell Theorem).\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. This charge is uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius `R` centered at `O`. The electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center `O`, is therefore calculated as if a point charge `+q` were located at `O`.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information regarding the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance from P to the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` is all extraneous information designed to be a distraction, as the principle of electrostatic shielding makes them irrelevant to the field outside the conductor.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
