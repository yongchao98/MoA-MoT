    "The derivation I performed seems correct. The search results confirm the fundamental principles used.\n\n1.  **Hooke's Law and Potential Energy**: The force is F = -kx, and the corresponding potential energy is U(x) = (1/2)kx^2. This is a standard result.\n2.  **Relativistic Energy**: The total energy of a particle is E = γmc^2, which is the sum of its rest energy (mc^2) and its relativistic kinetic energy K = (γ - 1)mc^2.\n3.  **Conservation of Energy**: For this system, the total energy, which is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy, plus the rest mass energy, must be conserved.\n\nThe logic is as follows:\n*   **Total Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x=A):**\n    *   The velocity is v = 0.\n    *   The Lorentz factor γ is 1.\n    *   The kinetic energy is K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0.\n    *   The potential energy is U(A) = (1/2)kA^2.\n    *   The total energy of the system is E_total = (Rest Energy) + (Kinetic Energy) + (Potential Energy) = mc^2 + 0 + (1/2)kA^2.\n\n*   **Total Energy at Equilibrium Position (x=0):**\n    *   The velocity is maximum, v = v_max.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max^2/c^2).\n    *   The kinetic energy is K_max = (γ_max - 1)mc^2.\n    *   The potential energy is U(0) = 0.\n    *   The total energy of the system is E_total = (Rest Energy) + (Kinetic Energy) + (Potential Energy) = mc^2 + (γ_max - 1)mc^2 + 0 = γ_max * mc^2.\n\n*   **Equating the Energies:**\n    *   By the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at x=A must equal the total energy at x=0.\n    *   mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = γ_max * mc^2\n\n*   **Solving for v_max:**\n    1.  Divide by mc^2:\n        1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2) = γ_max\n    2.  Substitute γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max^2/c^2):\n        1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2) = 1 / √(1 - v_max^2/c^2)\n    3.  Square both sides:\n        (1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2 = 1 / (1 - v_max^2/c^2)\n    4.  Invert and rearrange:\n        1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / (1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2\n    5.  Solve for v_max^2/c^2:\n        v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2\n    6.  Take the square root and multiply by c:\n        v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2]\n\nThis result matches option B exactly.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ - Correct.\nC) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ - This is the non-relativistic limit.\n\nThe derivation is robust and confirmed by the fundamental principles found in the search results.\n\nTo solve this problem, we apply the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Define the Total Energy of the System:**\n    The total energy (E) of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is the sum of its rest energy ($E_0 = mc^2$), its relativistic kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$), and its potential energy ($U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$).\n    $E = mc^2 + (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    Here, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This total energy E must remain constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    At $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = 1 \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Energy at the Equilibrium Position (x = 0):**\n    The mass reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$, as it passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is zero.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy $U(0) = 0$.\n    The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy is conserved, so we can equate the energy at the maximum amplitude with the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we square both sides:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n    Next, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, take the square root and multiply by $c$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
