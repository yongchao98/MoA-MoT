    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and an evaluation of each statement:\n\n*   **Step 1: Compound A (C3H6) + Br2/CCl4 → Compound B**\n    Compound A has the formula C3H6, which corresponds to propene or cyclopropane. The reaction with bromine in carbon tetrachloride is a classic test for unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Propene (CH3-CH=CH2) will undergo an addition reaction.\n    *   **A:** Propene (CH3-CH=CH2)\n    *   **B:** 1,2-Dibromopropane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br))\n\n*   **Step 2: Compound B + alcoholic KOH → Compound C**\n    This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction. The strong base, alcoholic potassium hydroxide, eliminates two molecules of hydrogen bromide (HBr) from the adjacent carbon atoms.\n    *   **C:** Propyne (CH3-C≡CH)\n\n*   **Step 3: Compound C passed through a red-hot iron tube → Compound D**\n    When alkynes like propyne are passed through a red-hot iron tube, they undergo cyclic polymerization (trimerization). Three molecules of propyne will form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n    *   **D:** 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)\n\n*   **Step 4: Compound D + mixture of two strong acids → Compound E**\n    This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically nitration, using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **E:** 2,4,6-Trimethylnitrobenzene (Nitromesitylene)\n\n*   **Step 5: Compound E + Fe/HCl → Compound F**\n    This reaction involves the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2) using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid.\n    *   **F:** 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (Mesitylamine)\n\n*   **Step 6: Compound F + Nitrous acid → Compound G**\n    This is a diazotization reaction where a primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (NaNO2 + HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **G:** 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride\n\n*   **Step 7: Compound G + NaOH → Compound H**\n    The diazonium salt, when warmed with a weak base like NaOH solution, undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol.\n    *   **H:** 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol (Mesitylol)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. Phenols typically give a characteristic color (often violet, blue, or green) with a neutral ferric chloride solution. However, some sterically hindered phenols or substituted phenols may give different colors or no color at all. The statement specifies a yellow color. While a color reaction is expected, the exact color being yellow is questionable and might be incorrect as the typical result is a violet/blue/green complex. Without a specific reference for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol's test result, this statement is suspect.\n\n**B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, and the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This results in two distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum, both of which are singlets because there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons to cause splitting. This statement is correct.\n\n**C) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Propyne has a boiling point of -23.2 °C. Since this is below room temperature, propyne is a gas under standard conditions. It is also described as a highly flammable and colorless gas. This statement is correct.\n\n**D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesitylamine). Aromatic amines are well-known precursors in the synthesis of various dyes, particularly azo dyes. Specifically, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is used as an intermediate for dyes. This statement is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements B, C, and D are correct. Statement A is the most likely incorrect statement. The ferric chloride test for phenols usually produces a violet, blue, or green color, not yellow.\n\n<<<A>>>"
