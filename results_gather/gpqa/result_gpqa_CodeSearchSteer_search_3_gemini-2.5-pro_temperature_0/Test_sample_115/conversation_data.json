    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A:** The proton NMR data shows a triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm and a quartet for 4H at 1.3 ppm. While the splitting pattern for the 4H signal in n-butane is technically more complex, this description is a common simplification for the two equivalent ethyl groups in **n-butane** (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃). The integration ratio (6:4 or 3:2) and the chemical shifts are consistent with this structure.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B:** Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form compound B. The subsequent reaction of B with alcoholic KOH produces a compound C with two geometrical isomers. This indicates that B must be **2-bromobutane** (CH₃CH(Br)CH₂CH₃). Elimination of 1-bromobutane would only yield but-1-ene, which has no geometrical isomers.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C:** The reaction of 2-bromobutane with alcoholic KOH is an E2 elimination reaction. This reaction primarily forms the more substituted alkene, but-2-ene (CH₃CH=CHCH₃), according to Zaitsev's rule. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene. The problem specifies that the *cis*-isomer of C is used in the next step.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D:** This step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene, the dienophile) and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (the diene).\n    *   **Reaction:** A [4+2] cycloaddition occurs, forming a six-membered ring. The product is a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. This eliminates options A and D.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical outcome is determined by the geometry of the reactants and the \"endo rule\".\n        *   **Diene Conformation:** For the reaction to occur, the (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol must adopt an s-cis conformation. In this conformation, the -OH group at C1 and the -CH₃ group at C4 are both on the \"outside\" of the diene system, which means they will be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n        *   **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** The use of *cis*-but-2-ene means the two methyl groups (which become substituents at C5 and C6) will be *cis* to each other in the product.\n        *   **Endo Rule:** The Diels-Alder reaction generally favors the *endo* product. In this orientation, the substituents of the dienophile (the methyl groups at C5 and C6) are oriented *trans* to the \"outside\" substituents of the diene (the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4).\n    *   **Combining Stereochemical Information:**\n        *   The -OH at C1 is *cis* to the -CH₃ at C4.\n        *   The -CH₃ at C5 is *cis* to the -CH₃ at C6.\n        *   The {OH, CH₃ at C4} pair is *trans* to the {CH₃ at C5, CH₃ at C6} pair.\n    *   **Assigning R/S Configuration:** By assigning the absolute configuration to the chiral centers (C1, C4, C5, and C6) based on this relative stereochemistry, we find that the product is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
