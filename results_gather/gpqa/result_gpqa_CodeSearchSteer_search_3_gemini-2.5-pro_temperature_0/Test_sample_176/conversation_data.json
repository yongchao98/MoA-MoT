    "The search results confirm the physical laws I intended to use.\n-   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Luminosity is proportional to the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power (L = 4πR²σT⁴).\n-   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (T = b/λ_max). This law relates temperature to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength.\n-   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of a source is shifted depending on its radial velocity relative to the observer. A positive radial velocity (moving away) causes a redshift (increase in wavelength). The non-relativistic formula is v/c = Δλ/λ_rest or λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n\nThe key to the problem remains the interpretation of \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" As reasoned before, \"appeared\" refers to the observed wavelength (λ_obs). The inclusion of the specific radial velocity for Star 2 (700 km/s) and a zero velocity for Star 1 strongly suggests this information is intended to be used to correct the observed peak wavelength to the intrinsic peak wavelength, which is then used in Wien's Law to find the temperature.\n\nThe calculation I performed seems correct.\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Given Radius Ratio**: R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law**: T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n4.  **Wavelengths from Doppler Effect**:\n    *   λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁ (since v₁ = 0)\n    *   λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c) (assuming redshift for positive velocity)\n5.  **Equating Observed Wavelengths**: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂ => λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n6.  **Finding Wavelength Ratio**: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n7.  **Substituting into Temperature Ratio**: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n8.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The mass information is extraneous, likely to distract from the correct method.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach involves using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's displacement law, and the Doppler effect.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nMy calculated value is ~2.229, which rounds to 2.23. Option D (2.25) would be the answer if the Doppler shift were ignored. The small difference between C and D is the key, and the provided radial velocity data allows for this distinction.\n\nThe luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The ratio of the luminosities of two stars is therefore dependent on the ratio of their radii and the ratio of their surface temperatures.\n\nThe key steps to solving this problem are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: For Star 1 and Star 2, the ratio of their luminosities is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)²(T₁/T₂)⁴.\n3.  **Radius Information**: We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the star's surface temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). Specifically, T is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* (or rest-frame) peak wavelength (λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁.\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion relative to the observer. The relationship between the observed and rest wavelength is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds, λ_obs = λ_rest(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer).\n6.  **Applying the Data**:\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed peak wavelength is λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n7.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio**: From the relationship in the previous step, we find the ratio of the rest wavelengths: λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). This means T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n8.  **Final Calculation**: We can now substitute all the values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s))]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>"
