    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand the sources of solar neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how they are affected by the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch.\n\n### Solar Neutrino Sources and Energies\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction branches. The key reactions for this problem are:\n*   **Proton-Proton (pp) Chain:** This is the primary way the Sun produces energy and has three main branches.\n    *   **pp-I Branch:** Produces low-energy `pp` neutrinos (up to ~420 keV).\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** Produces two monoenergetic `7Be` (Beryllium-7) neutrino lines. The most prominent of these is at **861 keV** (sometimes cited as 862 keV), with a smaller one at 384 keV.\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** This branch is responsible for producing high-energy `8B` (Boron-8) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO Cycle:** A secondary process that also produces neutrinos, primarily from the decays of `13N` and `15O`, with continuous spectra.\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. The primary consequence of this is the complete disappearance of the `8B` neutrino flux. All other reaction branches, including pp-I, pp-II, and the CNO cycle, continue to operate as they were.\n\n### Analyzing the Neutrino Flux in the Energy Bands\n\nNow, let's examine the neutrino sources remaining in the two energy bands of interest after the `8B` neutrinos are gone:\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   `8B` Neutrinos: Flux is now zero.\n    *   `7Be` Neutrinos: The main line is at 861 keV, which is outside this band.\n    *   `pp` Neutrinos: Energy is too low to contribute.\n    *   **Remaining Source:** The only significant remaining contributors to this band are neutrinos from the CNO cycle (`13N` and `15O`), which have continuous energy spectra that extend into this range. The flux from these reactions is known to be relatively low compared to the main pp-chain fluxes.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   `8B` Neutrinos: Flux is now zero.\n    *   **Remaining Source:** This band contains the very strong, monoenergetic neutrino line from **`7Be` decay at 861 keV**. This reaction is part of the pp-II branch, which is unaffected by the shutdown of the pp-III branch. There is also a small contribution from CNO neutrinos in this range.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWith the pp-III branch stopped, the situation is as follows:\n*   **Flux (band 1):** Dominated by the low-level flux from CNO cycle neutrinos.\n*   **Flux (band 2):** Dominated by the very high flux from the `7Be` neutrino line at 861 keV.\n\nThe total flux from `7Be` neutrinos is roughly 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s, while the fluxes from the main CNO neutrinos (`13N` and `15O`) are on the order of 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s. This means the `7Be` flux is about 50 times larger than the CNO fluxes. When comparing the integrated flux in the 700-800 keV band (containing only CNO neutrinos) to the 800-900 keV band (dominated by the massive `7Be` peak), the flux in band 1 will be significantly smaller than the flux in band 2.\n\nThe ratio of the CNO flux to the `7Be` flux is on the order of 1/50 to 1/100. Therefore, the ratio of Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2) will be a very small number.\n\nGiven the options:\nA) 1.\nB) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nC) 10.\nD) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\nThe most plausible ratio is approximately 0.01, reflecting that the flux in the first band (from the weak CNO source) is about 100 times smaller than the flux in the second band (from the strong `7Be` source).\n\n<<<B>>>"
