    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nFirst, we need to establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The distance to the LMC is approximately 160,000 to 163,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use the value of 160,000 light-years.\n\n**1. Time from Earth's Perspective (Δt)**\n\nThis is the time an observer on Earth would measure for the journey.\n*   **Distance (d):** 160,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where c is the speed of light)\n\nThe time measured from Earth is calculated as:\nΔt = distance / speed\nΔt = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\nΔt ≈ 160,000.02 years\n\n**2. Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is a crucial component in time dilation calculations and is determined by the spacecraft's velocity.\nThe formula is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven v = 0.99999987c:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1 / √ (2.6 x 10⁻⁷)\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\n**3. Time for the Astronaut (Proper Time, Δt₀)**\n\nTime dilation causes time to pass slower for the moving astronaut relative to a stationary observer on Earth. The time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time) is calculated by dividing the Earth-measured time by the Lorentz factor.\nΔt₀ = Δt / γ\nΔt₀ ≈ 160,000.02 years / 1961.16\nΔt₀ ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis result is approximately 81 years.\n\n**4. Astronaut's Final Age**\n\nTo confirm the astronaut survives, we add the travel time to their initial age:\nFinal Age = 22 years + 81.58 years ≈ 103.58 years\n\nSince the astronaut's final age of approximately 104 years is less than their species' average lifespan of 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. The time elapsed for the astronaut during the trip is approximately 81 years.\n\n<<<A>>>"
