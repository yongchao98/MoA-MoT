    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n    This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom attaches to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n    When an α-halo ketone with available protons on the other side of the carbonyl group is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens up to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring) rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (a 5-membered ring).\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n    Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is added as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), which allows the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C-H bond on the same carbon (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4. Due to this symmetry, protons that can be reflected onto one another are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons (one pointing \"up\" and one \"down\" relative to the ring) are diastereotopic, meaning they are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, they represent two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 types)\n\nTallying these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde would show 6 distinct signals.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
