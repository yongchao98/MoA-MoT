    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide is a known method for generating the highly reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (an isomer of o-xylene, also known as an o-quinodimethane). This species is generated *in situ*.\n*   The generated diene (5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) then reacts with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Since the dienophile has two double bonds and two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs.\n*   **Product 1:** A large, polycyclic molecule is formed, which is the double Diels-Alder adduct. The tert-butoxy group remains at the C7 position of the central norbornane skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** The tert-butoxy group is an acid-labile protecting group for an alcohol. Aqueous acid cleaves the tert-butyl ether to yield an alcohol.\n*   **Product 2:** The same structure as Product 1, but the 7-(tert-butoxy) group has been converted to a 7-hydroxy (-OH) group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones.\n*   **Product 3:** The 7-hydroxy group of the central norbornane core is oxidized to a carbonyl group (ketone, C=O).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3.\n*   **Condition:** Heating at 150°C.\n*   **Reaction:** The Diels-Alder reaction is reversible. Heating a Diels-Alder adduct often leads to a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, breaking the adduct down into its original diene and dienophile components. This is a common strategy to generate or unmask unstable molecules.\n*   **Products of retro-Diels-Alder:** The reaction will yield two types of molecules:\n    1.  The dienophile part: This corresponds to the central bicyclic core, which is now **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n    2.  The diene part: Two molecules of **5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** are regenerated.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on **product 4**. Both fragments from the retro-Diels-Alder are products. We must determine which product is being referred to as \"4\" by examining the options provided.\n\n*   **Analysis of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one:** This molecule is highly symmetric (point group C₂ᵥ). It has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, and C7, and another plane passing through C7 and bisecting the C1-C4 bond. Due to this high symmetry, there are only **two** sets of chemically equivalent protons: the two bridgehead protons (H1, H4) are one set, and the four vinylic protons (H2, H3, H5, H6) are the other. This would give 2 signals in an NMR spectrum. This number is not among the options.\n\n*   **Analysis of 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring with two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups at positions 5 and 6. It has a total of 8 hydrogen atoms: four on the diene ring (H1, H2, H3, H4) and four on the two methylene groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The cyclohexadiene ring is not planar but exists in a twisted conformation. This makes the molecule chiral and removes all elements of symmetry (except the trivial C₁ identity element).\n    *   **Chemical Equivalence:** In a molecule with no symmetry, all atoms are, in principle, chemically distinct. Therefore, all 8 hydrogen atoms in a static molecule of 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene are chemically non-equivalent.\n        *   The four vinylic protons on the ring are all in unique environments.\n        *   The two protons on one methylene group are diastereotopic (due to the chirality of the rest of the molecule) and thus distinct. The same is true for the other methylene group. Furthermore, the two methylene groups themselves are not in equivalent environments.\n    *   This leads to a total of **8** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nSince 8 is one of the options, it is highly probable that \"product 4\" refers to the diene, 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
