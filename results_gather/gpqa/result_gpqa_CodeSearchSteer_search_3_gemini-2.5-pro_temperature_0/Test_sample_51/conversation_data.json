    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate here given the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the stellar photosphere.\n\n### The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n\n<sup>N<sub>2</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>N<sub>1</sub></sub> = (<sup>g<sub>2</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>g<sub>1</sub></sub>) * exp( <sup>-(E<sub>2</sub> - E<sub>1</sub>)</sup>&frasl;<sub>kT</sub> )\n\nWhere:\n*   **N<sub>2</sub>** and **N<sub>1</sub>** are the number of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1, respectively.\n*   **g<sub>2</sub>** and **g<sub>1</sub>** are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   **E<sub>2</sub> - E<sub>1</sub>** (or &Delta;E) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   **k** is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 &times; 10<sup>-23</sup> J/K).\n*   **T** is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots, which corresponds to a decrease in temperature (from 6000 K to 5500 K). Our formula confirms this: as temperature T decreases, the negative exponent becomes larger in magnitude, making the exponential term smaller.\n\n### Calculating the Change Factor\n\nWe need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio at 6000 K divided by the ratio at 5500 K.\n\nLet R<sub>nospots</sub> be the ratio at T<sub>nospots</sub> = 6000 K and R<sub>spots</sub> be the ratio at T<sub>spots</sub> = 5500 K.\n\nFactor = <sup>R<sub>nospots</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>R<sub>spots</sub></sub> = <sup>[ (g<sub>2</sub>/g<sub>1</sub>) * exp(-&Delta;E / kT<sub>nospots</sub>) ]</sup>&frasl;<sub>[ (g<sub>2</sub>/g<sub>1</sub>) * exp(-&Delta;E / kT<sub>spots</sub>) ]</sub>\n\nThe statistical weights (g<sub>2</sub>/g<sub>1</sub>) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nFactor = exp[ <sup>-&Delta;E</sup>&frasl;<sub>k</sub> * (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>T<sub>nospots</sub></sub> - <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>T<sub>spots</sub></sub>) ]\n\n### Determining the Energy Difference (&Delta;E)\n\nThe energy difference &Delta;E can be calculated from the wavelength (&lambda;) of the transition using the Planck-Einstein relation, &Delta;E = hc/&lambda;.\n\n*   **h** (Planck's constant) = 6.626 &times; 10<sup>-34</sup> J&middot;s\n*   **c** (speed of light) = 3.00 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> m/s\n*   **&lambda;** (wavelength) = 1448 &Aring; = 1448 &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> m\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term &Delta;E/k:\n\n<sup>&Delta;E</sup>&frasl;<sub>k</sub> = <sup>hc</sup>&frasl;<sub>&lambda;k</sub> = <sup>(6.626 &times; 10<sup>-34</sup> J&middot;s * 3.00 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> m/s)</sup>&frasl;<sub>(1448 &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> m * 1.381 &times; 10<sup>-23</sup> J/K)</sub> &asymp; 99,440 K\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the factor equation:\n\nFactor = exp[ -99,440 K * (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6000 K</sub> - <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5500 K</sub>) ]\n\nFactor = exp[ -99,440 * (<sup>5500 - 6000</sup>&frasl;<sub>6000 * 5500</sub>) ]\n\nFactor = exp[ -99,440 * (<sup>-500</sup>&frasl;<sub>33,000,000</sub>) ]\n\nFactor = exp( <sup>99,440</sup>&frasl;<sub>66,000</sub> )\n\nFactor = exp(1.5067)\n\nFactor &asymp; 4.51\n\nThis value is closest to 4.5. The additional information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not required for this calculation, as the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
