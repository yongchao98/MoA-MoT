    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ): **λ = 1 / (nσ)**.\n\n2.  **Defining λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):** In the initial state, before the electron beam is active, the mean free path λ1 refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   Therefore, **λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas)**.\n    *   Here, 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules, and 'σ_gas-gas' is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n3.  **Defining λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):** When the electron beam is turned on, λ2 represents the mean free path of the high-energy electrons as they travel through the same environment of residual gas molecules.\n    *   Therefore, **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)**.\n    *   The number density 'n' of the gas molecules remains the same. The critical difference is the collision cross-section, 'σ_e-gas', which now describes the interaction between an electron and a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   **Gas-Gas Collision (σ_gas-gas):** This is a \"hard-sphere\" type of collision, where two neutral molecules must come very close to each other to interact significantly. The cross-section is based on their kinetic diameter.\n    *   **Electron-Gas Collision (σ_e-gas):** This interaction is fundamentally different. An electron is a charged particle and interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron can be significantly deflected (an event which counts as a \"collision\" or \"scattering\") by the molecule's electron cloud and nucleus without getting physically close. This phenomenon is known as electron scattering. Because of this long-range force, the effective target area that a gas molecule presents to an electron is much larger than the area it presents to another neutral gas molecule.\n    *   Therefore, it is a well-established principle in physics that **σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on λ1 vs. λ2:**\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and σ_e-gas is larger than σ_gas-gas, it directly follows that the mean free path for electrons (λ2) must be shorter than the mean free path for gas molecules (λ1).\n    *   The observation that electrons are easily deflected and require a high vacuum for propagation in an electron microscope supports this conclusion.\n\nBased on this physical reasoning, the relationship between the two mean free paths is λ2 < λ1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
