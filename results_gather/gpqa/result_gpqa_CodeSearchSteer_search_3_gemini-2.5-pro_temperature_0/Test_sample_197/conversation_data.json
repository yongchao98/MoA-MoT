    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate the mole fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe relevant species in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺ ions\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the given overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy substituting these expressions into the equation for the total cobalt concentration, we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for [[Co(SCN)₂]] and c(Co), the [Co²⁺] term cancels out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven values are:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Since the total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M is significantly lower than the thiocyanate concentration, we can assume the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately 0.1 M).\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it D):\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the value of the numerator for α₂:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
