    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, especially in the radiation zone (far-field). The behavior of the radiated power is determined by the characteristics of this dipole radiation.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ = [ (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) ] * sin²(θ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `θ` is the angle between the oscillation axis (z-axis) and the direction of observation.\n\nThe radiated power is a function of the angle θ, specifically `f(θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`. The maximum power, A, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value of 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we calculate the value of `sin²(30°)`:\n\nsin(30°) = 1/2\nsin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe radiated power is also dependent on the angular frequency `ω` to the fourth power (`ω⁴`). The relationship between angular frequency and wavelength `λ` is:\n\nω = 2πc / λ\n\nSubstituting this into the power dependence, we find the relationship between power and wavelength:\n\nPower ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThis inverse fourth-power dependence on wavelength is known as Rayleigh's law. Thus, a possible form for the function `f` describing the radiated power includes a `λ⁻⁴` term.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4, and the radiated power has a wavelength dependence of λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
