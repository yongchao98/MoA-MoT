    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t` depend on the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is implicitly defined by the relation $t = t_r + d/c$, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThe correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (the charge's position, velocity, and the distance vector) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nBy factoring out `c` from the denominator, the expressions can be rewritten as:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions match option B. It is important to note that for a moving charge, a scalar potential alone is not sufficient to describe the electric field; a vector potential is also required.\n\n<<<B>>>"
