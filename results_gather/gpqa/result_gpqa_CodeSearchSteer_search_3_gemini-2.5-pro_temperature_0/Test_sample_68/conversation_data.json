    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the minimum resolution required.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   A particle (X⁰) moving at a relativistic speed has a longer lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference (the bubble chamber) than its own rest frame. This effect is called time dilation.\n    *   The distance this particle travels before decaying is called the decay length.\n    *   The decay of individual particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives for a certain distance follows an exponential decay law.\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be longer than the detector's spatial resolution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m₀).\n    *   E = 27 GeV\n    *   m₀ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n    *   γ = E / m₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (<L>):**\n    The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying (<L>) depends on its proper lifetime (τ₀), its velocity (v), and the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula is <L> = γ * v * τ₀. For highly relativistic particles, the velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. A more precise formula uses the particle's momentum `p`: <L> = (p/m₀) * c * τ₀.\n    *   First, find the momentum `p`: p = √(E² - m₀²) = √(27² - 3.41²) ≈ 26.78 GeV/c.\n    *   Now, calculate the mean decay length:\n        <L> = (p/m₀) * c * τ₀\n        <L> = (26.78 GeV/c / 3.41 GeV/c²) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n        <L> ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m)\n        <L> ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Resolution:**\n    We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the probability of a particle having a decay length (`l`) greater than the detector's resolution (`d_res`) must be at least 0.30.\n    *   P(l > d_res) ≥ 0.30\n    The probability of a particle surviving beyond a distance `d` is given by the exponential decay law: P(l > d) = exp(-d / <L>).\n    *   We need to find the maximum possible value for `d_res` that satisfies this condition:\n        exp(-d_res / <L>) = 0.30\n    *   Solving for `d_res`:\n        -d_res / <L> = ln(0.30)\n        d_res = -<L> * ln(0.30)\n        d_res ≈ -(1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n        d_res ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculation shows that the resolution must be less than or equal to 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m to observe at least 30% of the decays. We now check which of the given options satisfy this condition.\n    *   A) 2.08 * 10⁻⁶ m: This is ≤ 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. This resolution is sufficient.\n    *   B) 2.08 * 10⁻³ m: This is > 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. This resolution is not sufficient.\n    *   C) 2.08 * 10⁻⁹ m: This is ≤ 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. This resolution is sufficient.\n    *   D) 2.08 * 10⁻¹ m: This is > 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. This resolution is not sufficient.\n\n    Both options A and C are technically correct. However, the question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This is typically interpreted as the least stringent requirement, or the largest value for the resolution that still works. Option A is much closer to the calculated threshold of 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. The small discrepancy between the calculated value and option A is likely due to a slight inaccuracy in the problem's given values. Therefore, option A is the most reasonable answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
