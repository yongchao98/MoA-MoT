    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential equation:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))²\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is equivalent to two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The potential can be written as V(x, y) = V(x) + V(y), where:\nV(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x²\nV(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 k_eff z² is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k_eff/m).\n\nFor the oscillator in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is:\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the oscillator in the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators.\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
