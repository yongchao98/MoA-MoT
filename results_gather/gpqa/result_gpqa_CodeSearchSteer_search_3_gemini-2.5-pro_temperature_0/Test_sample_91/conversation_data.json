    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the enthalpy of formation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the different types of chemical bonds.\nThe given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Counting Carbon (C) atoms:** There are 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Counting Hydrogen (H) atoms:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**2. Count the Bonds**\n\nBy examining the structure, we can count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H single bonds.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are 2 C=C double bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds:** There are 9 C-C single bonds.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds and turn it into gaseous atoms. We use the given bond energies for this calculation.\n\n*   Energy to break 22 C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy to break 9 C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy to break 2 C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for the compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of gaseous carbon and 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 (breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for the elements = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy required to atomize the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f° = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n*   ΔH_f° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe question provides options in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. To compare our result with all options, we should convert our answer to kJ/g.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.45 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
