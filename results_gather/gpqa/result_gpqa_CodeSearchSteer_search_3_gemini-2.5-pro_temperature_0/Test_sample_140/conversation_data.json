    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the possible reaction pathways.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** Sodium amide is a very strong base that can remove a proton (or deuteron) from the positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion (NH2‚Åª) can remove the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored step due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is broken more easily than a C-D bond). This elimination leads to the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This process is slower but still occurs. This elimination results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate from Pathway A:** The benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6 (and deuterium at C2) is attacked by an amide ion.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of aniline-2-d after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of aniline-6-d, which is the same molecule as aniline-2-d.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A yields only one product: **aniline-2-d**.\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate from Pathway B:** The non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C1 and C2) is attacked by an amide ion.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of a carbanion, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   Therefore, Pathway B yields only one product: **aniline**.\n\nSince two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed, two different organic products are possible.\n\nThe two possible organic products are:\n*   Aniline-2-d\n*   Aniline\n\nThus, there are a total of two possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
