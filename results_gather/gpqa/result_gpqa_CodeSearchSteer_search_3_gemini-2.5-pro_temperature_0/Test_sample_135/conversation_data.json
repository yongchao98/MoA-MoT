    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, denoted as ∫∇⋅f dV. The vector field f has a magnitude of 1/r² and is directed radially outward from the origin. The integration is to be performed within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume to the surface integral of the field's flux through the closed surface enclosing that volume. The formula is:\n\n∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∬_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS\n\nHere, V is the volume of the sphere of radius R, and S is its surface. The vector f is given as f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction. The outward unit normal to the spherical surface, n̂, is also the radial unit vector r̂.\n\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radius r is equal to R. Therefore, the vector field on the surface is f(R) = (1/R²) r̂.\n\nThe dot product f ⋅ n̂ on the surface is:\nf ⋅ n̂ = (1/R²) r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1/R²\n\nNow, we can evaluate the surface integral:\n∬_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS = ∬_S (1/R²) dS\n\nSince R is a constant, 1/R² can be taken out of the integral:\n(1/R²) ∬_S dS\n\nThe integral ∬_S dS represents the total surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR².\n\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n(1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π\n\nA crucial point to consider is that the vector field f(r) = (1/r²) r̂ has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where it is undefined. A direct calculation of the divergence of f for r ≠ 0 gives zero. This might incorrectly suggest the integral is zero. However, the singularity at the origin acts as a source, and its contribution is captured by the Divergence Theorem. In fact, the divergence of this specific field is more accurately represented by a Dirac delta function, ∇⋅(r̂/r²) = 4πδ³(r). Integrating this over the volume of the sphere, which contains the origin, also yields 4π.\n\nThus, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π.\n\n<<<D>>>"
