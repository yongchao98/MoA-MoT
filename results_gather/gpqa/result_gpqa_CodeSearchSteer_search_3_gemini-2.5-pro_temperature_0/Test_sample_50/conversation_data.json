    "To determine the net potential energy of a charge `q` placed a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, we can use the method of images. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the complex charge distribution induced on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\".\n\nHere's a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the induced charge on the sphere's surface creates an electric field outside the sphere that is identical to the field of an image charge `q'`. This image charge is located at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = - (R/d) * q`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is `d' = R^2 / d`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere (which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge).\n\n    The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is due to the image charge `q' = -Rq/x` at a distance `x' = R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - x'`.\n    The force is `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2 = k * q * (-Rq/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * R * q^2 * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`:\n    `U = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[d to ∞] -k * R * q^2 * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n    To solve this integral, we can use a substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = -k * R * q^2 * (1/2) ∫[d^2-R^2 to ∞] du / u^2`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * R * q^2 * [-1/u] from (d^2 - R^2) to ∞`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * R * q^2 * [0 - (-1 / (d^2 - R^2))]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    An alternative and simpler way to think about this is that the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The interaction energy is `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - d')`.\n\n    Let's calculate this:\n    *   `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * (-Rq/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The net potential energy is `U = (1/2) * U_interaction = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
