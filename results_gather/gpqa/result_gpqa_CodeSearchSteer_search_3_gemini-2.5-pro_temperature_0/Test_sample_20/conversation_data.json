    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a compound generally needs a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of p-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms that are part of the carbonyl groups (C=O) are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. The other four carbon atoms are part of C=C double bonds and are sp2 hybridized. These carbons have vinylic hydrogens, not the required α-hydrogens on an sp3 hybridized carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups and possess acidic α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and particularly stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the trans isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. While it exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
