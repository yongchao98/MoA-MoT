    "To determine why the protein overexpression failed, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`. In DNA, `ATG` is the most common start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). Translation of a protein begins here.\n2.  **Identify the HA Tag Sequence:** The construct was designed to have an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The amino acid sequence for this tag is `YPYDVPDYA`. The DNA sequence immediately following the `ATG` start codon is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`. Translating this using a standard DNA codon table reveals:\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    This confirms that the DNA sequence correctly codes for the HA tag `YPYDVPDYA`. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect as there is no missense mutation in the tag sequence.\n3.  **Examine the Sequence Immediately After the Tag:** The DNA sequence continues with `AAATGA...`. When the ribosome reads this part of the mRNA (which would be `AAA UGA`), it first encounters the codon `AAA`, which codes for Lysine (Lys).\n4.  **Identify the Premature Stop Codon:** The very next codon is `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it does not code for an amino acid but instead signals for the termination of translation. This causes the ribosome to detach from the mRNA, releasing the newly synthesized, but incomplete, polypeptide chain.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe ribosome initiates translation at the `ATG` start codon, correctly synthesizes the HA tag and one additional amino acid (Lysine), and then immediately encounters a `TGA` stop codon. This results in the production of a tiny, 11-amino-acid peptide (`Met-YPYDVPDYA-Lys`), not the full-length GADD45G fusion protein. This premature termination of translation is the reason the expected protein is not observed.\n\n*   **Option A is correct** because the ribosome terminates translation early due to the premature `TGA` stop codon.\n*   **Option B is incorrect** because the HA tag sequence is correct.\n*   **Option C is incorrect** because `UAA` is a universal stop codon, but the codon in question is `TGA`. Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation. While some rare exceptions exist where TGA can code for an amino acid (e.g., in mitochondria), this is not the case for standard expression in the nucleus of Chinese hamster ovary cells.\n*   **Option D is incorrect** because while a lack of a linker can sometimes cause issues, the definitive problem here is the premature stop codon which prevents the synthesis of the full-length protein in the first place.\n\n<<<A>>>"
