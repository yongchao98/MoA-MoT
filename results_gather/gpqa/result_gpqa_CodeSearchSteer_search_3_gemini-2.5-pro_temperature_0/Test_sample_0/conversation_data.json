    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the energy uncertainty (or natural linewidth) of each level. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is given by the relation:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy (the natural linewidth of the energy level).\n*   **Δt** is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nA quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a definite energy. The lifetime of the state (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, we can calculate the energy uncertainty for each level using a simplified form of the relation, ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n**1. Calculate the energy uncertainty for the first state (E1):**\n*   Lifetime (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**2. Calculate the energy uncertainty for the second state (E2):**\n*   Lifetime (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than the broader of the two linewidths. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than this value.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the energy uncertainty of the broader state.\n\n<<<C>>>"
