    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n### **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the three equivalent protons of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-COO-). The singlet multiplicity indicates no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the chemical shift region typical for vinyl protons, which are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This vinyl proton is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to only one other proton. Its high chemical shift (downfield) is due to the deshielding effect of being attached to the ester oxygen atom (-CH=CH-O-). The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vicinal protons on a double bond are stereochemically dependent. A J value in the range of 12-18 Hz is indicative of a *trans* relationship between the protons.\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (CH₃-) that is split into a doublet. This splitting pattern means it is adjacent to a single proton, consistent with a CH₃-CH= group.\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This vinyl proton's multiplicity reveals its neighbors. It is split into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm) and further split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these signals confirms the structure CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the two vinyl protons unequivocally establishes their *trans* configuration. A *cis* isomer would exhibit a much smaller coupling constant, typically between 6-12 Hz. The other compound options, cis- and trans-butenyl acetate, are inconsistent with the observed splitting patterns and proton count. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
