    "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be analyzed for sources of chirality. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism if rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. For atropisomerism to lead to optical activity, two conditions must be met: the rotation around the central single bond must be restricted, and the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry. In this specific compound, all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the biphenyl linkage. The substitution pattern is asymmetric, meaning the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. Therefore, it can be resolved into enantiomers and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. Optical isomerism in this type of molecule typically arises from the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active. It exists as two optical isomers, L- and D-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure features a carbon-carbon double bond. The two carboxylate groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), it is not optically active. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is achiral. Therefore, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>"
