    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\nPropionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃). This reaction forms a cyclic thioacetal, which protects the aldehyde functional group. The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\nProduct A is treated with butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base. BuLi removes the acidic proton from the carbon atom situated between the two sulfur atoms (C2), creating a carbanion. This type of reactivity, where the polarity of the carbonyl carbon is reversed, is known as \"umpolung\". Product B is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\nThe carbanion B acts as a nucleophile and reacts with bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an alkylation reaction. The carbanion attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The resulting product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\nThis step involves the hydrolysis of the thioacetal protecting group to regenerate a carbonyl group. Reagents like mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) in the presence of water and acid are used for this deprotection. The product, D, is a ketone where the carbonyl carbon is bonded to the two ethyl groups that were attached at the C2 position. This ketone is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, CH₃CH₂COCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\nThis is a Wittig reaction, a method used to synthesize alkenes from carbonyl compounds.\n*   First, the Wittig reagent (a phosphorus ylide) is prepared from 3-bromopentane and triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), followed by deprotonation with BuLi. This creates the ylide (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n*   Next, this ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone and the substituted carbon group of the ylide are exchanged.\n\nThe reaction is:\n(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O (3-pentanone) + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n\nThe final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n      |\nCH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n      |\n      CH₂CH₃\n```\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. We can identify the chemically equivalent carbons to determine the number of 13C-NMR signals:\n1.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce a single signal.\n2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** All four methylene groups are also chemically equivalent. This will produce a second signal.\n3.  **Alkene carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the double bond are in identical chemical environments. This will produce a third signal.\n\nTherefore, due to its symmetry, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will produce a total of **3** signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
