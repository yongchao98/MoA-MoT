    "In physics, regularization is a method used to handle infinities that arise in calculations, particularly in quantum field theories. These infinities, known as divergences, typically occur when calculating interactions at very high energies (ultraviolet divergences) or very small distances.\n\nHere is an analysis of the given theories:\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory runs into problems at high energies, or equivalently, small distances. For instance, the self-energy of a point-like electron is predicted to be infinite, which indicates a breakdown of the theory. This requires some form of regularization or modification to resolve.\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As a quantum field theory, QED famously requires regularization to handle the ultraviolet divergences that appear in calculations of particle interactions, especially those involving loops in Feynman diagrams. After regularization, a process called renormalization is used to absorb these infinities into a redefinition of physical parameters like mass and charge, leading to finite and highly accurate predictions.\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory describing the strong nuclear force. It also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in perturbative calculations and therefore requires regularization and renormalization. Lattice QCD is a specific approach that uses a discretized space-time as a form of regularization.\n\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** A key motivation for superstring theory is its potential to be a quantum theory of gravity that is free of ultraviolet (UV) divergences. The theory posits that fundamental particles are not point-like but rather one-dimensional \"strings.\" This extended nature of strings is believed to smooth out interactions at very short distances (high energies), thus avoiding the infinities that plague point-particle quantum field theories. Consequently, superstring theory is thought to be UV finite and does not require regularization for high-energy divergences.\n\n<<<C>>>"
