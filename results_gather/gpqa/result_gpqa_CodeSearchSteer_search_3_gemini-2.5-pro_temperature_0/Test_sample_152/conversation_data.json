    "The analysis of the three Michael addition reactions leads to the following conclusions:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** The base (NaOEt) deprotonates dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`, at the acidic α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n4.  **Product Formation:** The initial adduct is protonated by the ethanol solvent. The resulting product structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃`.\n5.  **Nomenclature:** This product is named as a substituted propane derivative. The main chain is a three-carbon chain with three trimethyl carboxylate groups. Following IUPAC nomenclature, the correct name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone. Enamines are effective nucleophiles in Michael additions, a process known as the Stork enamine synthesis. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n3.  **Reaction:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Workup:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) serves two purposes: it protonates the intermediate and hydrolyzes the resulting iminium salt back into a ketone.\n5.  **Product Formation:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position. The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile, resulting in the structure **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the stable product after acidic hydrolysis.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Retrosynthesis:** This is a reverse analysis to identify reactant C. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK) is a classic Michael acceptor.\n3.  **Michael Donor (C):** The product shows that the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety has acted as the nucleophile, with the new bond formed at its C2 position. The protons on the carbon between two carbonyl groups (C2) are particularly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a stable enolate. This enolate then acts as the Michael donor.\n4.  **Reactant Identification:** Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
