    "To determine the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy Î³-rays is limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for this process. The interaction is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, where a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a CMB photon ($\\gamma$) to create an electron ($e^{-}$) and a positron ($e^{+}$).\n\nThe threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the high-energy photon to make this reaction possible. This occurs when the electron and positron are created with no excess kinetic energy in the center-of-momentum frame of the two photons. The calculation relies on the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe key steps in the calculation are:\n1.  **Invariant Mass**: The total energy in the center-of-momentum frame at the threshold is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and the positron, which is $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the rest mass of an electron and $c$ is the speed of light. The square of this invariant energy is $(2m_e c^2)^2$.\n2.  **Lab Frame Energy**: In the laboratory frame (our frame of reference), we consider a head-on collision between the high-energy photon of energy $E_{HE}$ and a CMB photon of energy $E_{CMB}$. This configuration gives the lowest possible threshold energy. The square of the invariant energy in this frame is given by $4 E_{HE} E_{CMB}$.\n3.  **Threshold Condition**: By equating the expressions from both frames, we get the condition for the threshold energy:\n    $4 E_{HE} E_{CMB} = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n4.  **Solving for High Energy**: Rearranging the formula to solve for the energy of the gamma-ray gives:\n    $E_{HE} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given and known values:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron is a known physical constant, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$, which is equal to $0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n$E_{HE} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{HE} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{HE} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{HE} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the answers in units of Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$. Converting our result to GeV:\n$E_{HE} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV corresponds to option B. Above this energy, the universe becomes increasingly opaque to gamma-rays because the probability of them interacting with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs rises sharply, thus limiting their travel distance and effective lifetime.\n\n<<<B>>>"
