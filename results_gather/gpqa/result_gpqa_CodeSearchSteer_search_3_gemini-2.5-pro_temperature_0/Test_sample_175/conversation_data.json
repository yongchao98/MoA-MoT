    "This is a problem of sequential quantum measurements. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**1. Initial State and Normalization**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `( -1 )`\n      `(  2 )`\n      `(  1 )`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization factor is 1/√6. The normalized state vector is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `( -1 )`\n                      `(  2 )`\n                      `(  1 )`\n\n**2. Measurement of Observable P**\n\nThe operator for P is:\nP = `( 0    1/√2   0   )`\n    `( 1/√2  0    1/√2 )`\n    `( 0    1/√2   0   )`\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring the value 0 for P. This requires finding the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for P = 0:**\n    We solve the equation P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩:\n    `( 0    1/√2   0   ) (x)`   `(0)`\n    `( 1/√2  0    1/√2 ) (y)` = `(0)`\n    `( 0    1/√2   0   ) (z)`   `(0)`\n\n    From the first and third rows, we get (1/√2)y = 0, which means y = 0.\n    From the second row, we get (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0, which means x = -z.\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form (x, 0, -x). Let's choose x=1, the unnormalized eigenvector is (1, 0, -1).\n\n*   **Normalize the eigenvector |p₀⟩:**\n    The squared norm is 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2.\n    The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n    |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `( 1 )`\n                      `( 0 )`\n                      `(-1 )`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0:**\n    The probability is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector:\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n    ⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1) ] ⋅ [ (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1) ]\n    ⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * ( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\n    Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3.\n\n**3. State Collapse and Measurement of Q**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector |p₀⟩. The new state of the system is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `( 1 )`\n                         `( 0 )`\n                         `(-1 )`\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on this new state |ψ'⟩. The operator for Q is:\nQ = `( 1   0   0 )`\n    `( 0   0   0 )`\n    `( 0   0  -1 )`\n\nWe want to find the probability of getting the value -1 for Q.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for Q = -1:**\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n    |q₋₁⟩ = `( 0 )`\n             `( 0 )`\n             `( 1 )`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1:**\n    The probability is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the new state |ψ'⟩ onto the eigenvector |q₋₁⟩:\n    Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²\n    ⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = (0, 0, 1) ⋅ [ (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1) ]\n    ⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * ( (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1) ) = -1/√2\n    Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2.\n\n**4. Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then immediately measuring Q=-1 is the product of the two probabilities:\nTotal Prob = Prob(P=0) × Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)\nTotal Prob = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
