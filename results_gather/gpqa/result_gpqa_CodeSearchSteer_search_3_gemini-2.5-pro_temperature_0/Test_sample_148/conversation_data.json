    "The observations described—duplicate peaks for an alpha-proton in ¹H NMR and two separable peaks of identical mass in LC-MS—point to the presence of isomers. The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of why this is the most fitting explanation:\n\n*   **NMR Observations**: The presence of two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton, which are not due to spin-spin coupling, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and have different physical properties. This difference in 3D structure leads to distinct chemical environments for their nuclei, resulting in separate signals in an NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Enantiomers**, being mirror images, are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment and would produce only a single set of peaks.\n    *   A **precursor** or a **'double-coupled' product** would be a different molecule altogether, likely with a significantly different NMR spectrum and, crucially, a different mass.\n\n*   **LC-MS Observations**: The liquid chromatography (LC) separates two components that the mass spectrometry (MS) confirms have the same mass as the expected molecule.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like reversed-phase HPLC.\n    *   **Enantiomers** cannot be separated by standard LC; a chiral stationary phase is required.\n    *   Contaminants like precursors would have a different mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n\n**A Common Cause in Peptides: Rotamers**\n\nA very common reason for these specific observations in synthetic peptides is the presence of **rotamers**, which are a specific type of diastereomer. They arise from slow rotation around a chemical bond, most notably the amide (peptide) bond.\n\n1.  **Cis-Trans Isomerism**: The peptide bond has partial double-bond character, which restricts rotation. This can lead to both *cis* and *trans* isomers. While the *trans* form is usually more stable, the energy barrier to interconversion can be high enough that both forms are observed on the NMR timescale at room temperature, leading to two sets of peaks. This is particularly common for peptide bonds preceding a proline residue.\n2.  **Atropisomerism**: This is another form of rotational isomerism where bulky substituents create a high barrier to rotation around a single bond, leading to stable, separable isomers that are a type of diastereomer.\n3.  **Separation and Detection**: These rotamers (or atropisomers) are diastereomeric and thus have slightly different shapes and polarities, allowing them to be separated by LC. Since they are isomers, they have the same elemental composition and therefore the same mass, as observed in the LC-MS. The fact that the peaks are resolved at an elevated temperature in the LC-MS is also consistent with the analysis of such isomers.\n\nIn summary, the evidence strongly refutes contamination or 'double coupling' (wrong mass) and the presence of enantiomers (would not be resolved by standard NMR or LC). The observations are classic indicators of diastereomers, very likely arising from the presence of stable rotamers (cis-trans isomers) of the peptide.\n\n<<<A>>>"
