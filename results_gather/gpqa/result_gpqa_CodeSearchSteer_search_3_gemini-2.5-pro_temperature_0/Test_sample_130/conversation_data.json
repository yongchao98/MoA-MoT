    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants**\n\n*   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C spectrum. This spectroscopic data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. The Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically favored product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n**3. Structure and NMR of the Products**\n\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. The reaction of the symmetric diene and symmetric dienophile results in a product with a plane of symmetry.\n*   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride).\n*   Based on the structure, we can predict the ¹H NMR signals:\n    *   **Two equivalent vinylic methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, typically around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, in a more shielded environment, around 1.0 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent protons from the anhydride part:** A singlet for 2 protons, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups, around 3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Two methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* or \"up\" and the other is *anti* or \"down\" relative to the double bond). They are not chemically equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two separate doublets. Their chemical shifts are typically around 1.3-1.5 ppm.\n*   This predicted spectrum (two 6H singlets, one 2H singlet, and two 1H doublets) is consistent with the signals described in the options.\n\n**4. Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicycloheptene system. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n*   **In the *exo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n*   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is a definitive characteristic of the *endo* adduct and will be absent in the *exo* adduct.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n*   The distinguishing cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* geometry.\n*   This corresponds to the interaction between the **anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
