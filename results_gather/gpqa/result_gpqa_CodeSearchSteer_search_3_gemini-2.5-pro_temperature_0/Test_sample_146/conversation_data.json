    "To determine the velocity of particle A, we apply the principle of conservation of energy to the annihilation process.\n\n**1. Initial Energy**\nThe initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, this is twice the rest energy of a proton.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n\nThe rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final Energy**\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are produced from the annihilation, they will share the total initial energy. By conservation of momentum, if the initial system was at rest, the final particles must move in such a way that the total momentum remains zero. This implies that all four resulting particles will have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same energy.\n\nThe energy of a single relativistic particle ($E_A$) is given by:\n\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nwhere $m_A c^2$ is the rest energy of particle A (given as 300 MeV) and $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity**\nNow, we can find the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor. The formula for velocity in terms of gamma is:\n\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v \\approx 0.7688 c$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>"
