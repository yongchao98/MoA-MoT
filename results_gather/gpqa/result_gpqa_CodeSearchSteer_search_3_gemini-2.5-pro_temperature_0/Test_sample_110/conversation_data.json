    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming a single regioselective enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate. After protonation during workup, the added group is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming**: The product is an ester, so it is named as a substituted propanoate. The ethyl group comes from the ethyl acrylate ester. The main chain is the three-carbon propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at C2.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups are on C3 (the original C2).\n    *   The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition, specifically a nitro-Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane.\n2.  **Nitronate Formation**: The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂) is acidic. KOH removes a proton from this carbon to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion, `[CH₃-CH₂-CH=NO₂]⁻`.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming**: The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is designated as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group has six carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile:\n        *   A methyl group is on C3.\n        *   A nitro group is on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
