    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid, 1 carbon in the formyl group, and 2 carbons in the vinyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the reaction conditions.\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce the following functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   Alcohols are also reduced to alkanes.\n\nThe red phosphorus regenerates the HI from the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the functional groups and points of unsaturation in the starting material:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl group** at C2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **double bond** in the cyclohexene ring is saturated, turning the ring into a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The **vinyl group** at C5 is reduced to an **ethyl group**.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, specifically 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane (the numbering may change based on IUPAC rules for the final product, but the connectivity remains the same). The carbon skeleton is C₁₀. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For a C₁₀ cycloalkane, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Analyzing the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The product has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The product has zero double or triple bonds.\nTherefore, the IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
