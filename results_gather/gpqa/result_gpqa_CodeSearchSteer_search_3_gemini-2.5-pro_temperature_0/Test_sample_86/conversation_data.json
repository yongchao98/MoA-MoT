    "To identify the correct 1H NMR data, we must first deduce the most likely structure of the compound based on the provided information.\n\n### Structural Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄).\n2.  **Total Carbons**: The molecule contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n3.  **Functional Groups**: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\nBased on these points, we can determine the nature of the two substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nThe most common and stable substituent fitting the \"2 carbons and a carbonyl\" description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃). This gives us a haloacetophenone structure (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n\nAnother possibility could be a formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO), leading to a halophenylacetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n### 1H NMR Data Interpretation\n\nNow, let's analyze the given NMR options in the context of these possible structures. The options B and C both show a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This \"two-doublet\" pattern is highly characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring, which creates a symmetrical molecule.\n\n*   **Option A and D** can be eliminated. Option D lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Option A shows only one proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons).\n\nWe are left with options B and C, which correspond to the two plausible *para*-substituted structures:\n\n*   **Structure for Option C**: *p*-haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group directly attached to the ring, which strongly deshields the aromatic protons, shifting them downfield. The provided shifts of 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm are consistent with this. For example, the aromatic protons of *p*-chloroacetophenone are found at approximately 7.89 ppm and 7.43 ppm.\n    *   **Methyl protons**: The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are adjacent to a carbonyl, but not to any other protons, so they appear as a singlet. A chemical shift of ~2.3-2.6 ppm is typical for an acetyl group's methyl protons. The value of 2.3 ppm in option C is a very reasonable value.\n    *   The data in option C: **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)** is fully consistent with the structure of a *p*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Structure for Option B**: *p*-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n    *   **Aldehyde proton**: The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   **Methylene protons**: The signal at 3.7 ppm is appropriate for methylene protons (-CH₂) situated between an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: In this structure, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is separated from the ring by a -CH₂- group. This separation reduces its deshielding effect on the aromatic protons compared to acetophenone. Therefore, the aromatic proton signals would be expected at a higher field (lower ppm value), typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The shifts of 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm given in option B are too far downfield for this structure. For instance, the aromatic protons of 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (a similar structure) appear around 7.3 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical shifts for the aromatic protons in option C (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are much more consistent with the strong deshielding effect of a carbonyl group directly attached to the aromatic ring, as in *p*-haloacetophenone. The data in option B, while correctly identifying an aldehyde, presents aromatic shifts that are inconsistent with the proposed structure. Therefore, the compound is a *p*-haloacetophenone, and the correct NMR data is provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
