    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in each reaction and how they would be observed in the different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers at C3 (R or S). Since the stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S), the products are:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (S at C5) and the other being different (R/S at C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric and achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible combinations of these stereocenters lead to three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting together as a single peak.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two products. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n\nAssuming the products of Reaction I do not co-elute with the products of Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption for different molecular structures), the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram will be 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be separated by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all separable compounds, which is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
