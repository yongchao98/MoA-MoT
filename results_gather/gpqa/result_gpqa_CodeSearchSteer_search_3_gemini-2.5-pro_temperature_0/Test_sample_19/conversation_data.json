    "The \"impulse\" approximation is a foundational concept in many-body nuclear physics that simplifies complex interactions. It posits that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus can be treated as a collection of independent interactions with its individual nucleons. The core assumptions that jointly define this approximation are as follows:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the primary tenet of the impulse approximation. The total interaction is viewed as an incoherent sum of separate interactions with single nucleons. The other nucleons in the nucleus are considered \"spectators\" to the event.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** In its simplest form, known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), the incoming probe and the outgoing particles are treated as plane waves. This means they do not interact with the rest of the nuclear medium on their way in or out. This assumption simplifies the problem by ignoring complex final-state interactions.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** The interaction is assumed to happen over a very short timescale. During this brief period, the strong forces that bind the nucleon within the nucleus are considered negligible. Therefore, the nucleon is treated as a free particle during the collision itself.\n\nThe third statement provided in the question, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" is an assumption about the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not about the dynamics of the interaction within the nucleus. The impulse approximation can be used with various models of the nucleon, making this an independent approximation rather than a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
