    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the M+ peak, is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns well with the C=O stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This evidence makes options C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (an aldehyde with a regular alcohol -OH) and B (a chloroformate with no -OH group).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and appearing as a singlet is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The ring has two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). Each set appears as a doublet because they are splitting each other.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The singlet at 11.0 ppm confirms the carboxylic acid. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde):** Inconsistent with the very broad IR peak and the NMR data.\n*   **Option B (Phenyl chloroformate):** Inconsistent with IR and NMR data (no O-H group).\n*   **Option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, with four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **Option C (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data. It has the correct mass and chlorine isotope pattern. The IR data matches a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and the characteristic *para*-substitution pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
