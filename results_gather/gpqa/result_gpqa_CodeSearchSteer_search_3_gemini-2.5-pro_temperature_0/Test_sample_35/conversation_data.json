    "To determine what is most likely observed, we must first identify the absorption line by calculating its energy at its source, known as the rest-frame energy. The light from an object at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) is significantly redshifted, meaning its wavelength is stretched and its energy is decreased as it travels to us.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the redshift (z) corresponding to a distance of approximately 2.1 Gpc. While the exact value depends on the specific cosmological model used, a distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a redshift of approximately z = 0.5.\n\nNext, we can calculate the rest-frame energy (E_rest) using the observed energy (E_obs = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) and the redshift (z):\n\nE_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\nE_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.5)\nE_rest = 5.85 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\nThis calculated rest-frame energy of approximately 5.85 micro-electronvolts (µeV) is remarkably close to the well-known energy of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, which is about 5.87 µeV. This transition, which involves a \"spin-flip\" of the electron relative to the proton, produces the famous 21 cm radio line.\n\nThe 21 cm line is a key tracer of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in the interstellar medium (ISM). This atomic gas exists in two main phases: a Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) with temperatures around 100 K and a Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) with temperatures around 6000 K.\n\nAbsorption lines, like the one detected, are typically observed when a cold gas cloud sits in front of a brighter, more distant background source. The strength of the 21 cm absorption is inversely proportional to the temperature of the gas. Therefore, the much colder gas of the CNM produces a significantly stronger absorption signature than the WNM. For this reason, 21 cm absorption studies are excellent probes of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
