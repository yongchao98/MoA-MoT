    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically analyzing its constituent parts.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Proton (¹H) Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** The prompt describes a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals for aromatic protons. This pattern, often an AA'BB' system, is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring, which has a total of 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons—one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). This group contains 2 vinyl protons.\n    *   **Methyl (-CH₃) Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups. One signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) substituent. The other methyl signal must belong to the ester group, as no other structural source is suggested. Since the problem states there are no methylene (`-CH₂`) groups, this methyl must be directly attached to the ester functionality (i.e., a methyl ester or an acetyl group). Each methyl group contributes 3 protons, for a total of 6 protons from these two groups.\n    *   **Total Protons:** Summing these up gives a total of 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 protons.\n\n2.  **Carbon Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The `-CH=CH-CH₃` group adds 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The NMR data indicates a methyl group is part of this functionality, with no adjacent `-CH₂` groups. This leads to two possibilities for the ester substituent: a methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these groups contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester) = 11 carbons.\n\n3.  **Oxygen Count:**\n    *   The ester functional group (`-COO-`) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element, the molecular formula is determined to be **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information. Compounds such as (E)-methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate are isomers that fit this formula and the spectral data described.\n\nThis eliminates the other options:\n*   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂`: Incorrect carbon count.\n*   `C₁₂H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts, and would likely contain `-CH₂` groups, which are explicitly absent.\n*   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect hydrogen count and would imply a saturated alkyl chain instead of a propenyl group, contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
