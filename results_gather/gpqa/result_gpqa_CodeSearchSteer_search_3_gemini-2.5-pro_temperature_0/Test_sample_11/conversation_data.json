    "To find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n**Given:**\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (m_ν) is considered to be zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum of the stationary pion is zero, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum (p).\n*   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n*   E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the stationary pion: E_π = m_πc²\n*   For the neutrino (massless): E_ν = pc\n*   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for the momentum (pc), we can rearrange and square the equation:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of pc:\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**3. Calculating Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    For a massless particle like the neutrino, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (KE = E - mc²).\n    First, find the total energy of the muon:\n    E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\n    E_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n    Now, calculate the kinetic energy:\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n    KE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values closely match one of the given options.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
