    "To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a quick and accurate detection of a new retrovirus, the correct approach involves identifying the virus's genetic material and then developing a highly sensitive test to detect it.\n\nThe most appropriate method is described in option A. Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are correct:\n\n*   **Virus Identification:** Retroviruses, like HIV and the virus that causes COVID-19, have an RNA genome. To determine the genetic sequence of an RNA virus, the RNA must first be converted into a more stable complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. This cDNA can then be sequenced to identify the unique genetic makeup of the new virus. This initial sequencing step is crucial for designing a specific and accurate diagnostic test.\n\n*   **Diagnostic Kit Development:** Once the viral sequence is known, a real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test can be developed. This technique is considered a gold standard for detecting viral infections because it is extremely sensitive, specific, and provides rapid results, sometimes in just a few hours. The test uses specific primers that target and amplify a unique segment of the virus's genetic material, allowing for the detection of even minute quantities of the virus in a patient's sample.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n\n*   **Option B is incorrect** because identifying a virus based on symptoms alone is unreliable. Many different viruses can cause similar symptoms, and a molecular test requires the precise genetic sequence to design accurate primers.\n*   **Option C is incorrect** because it describes a serological test (ELISA) that detects IgG antibodies. While useful, serology has limitations for *quick* diagnosis in an acute outbreak. It takes time for the body to produce detectable levels of antibodies (the \"diagnostic window\"), so this method is not ideal for identifying an active infection in its early stages. Molecular tests that detect the virus itself are much faster for early diagnosis.\n*   **Option D is incorrect** because it states the virus is identified by \"DNA sequencing.\" Retroviruses have an RNA genome, so the essential step of converting RNA to cDNA (reverse transcription) before sequencing is missing, making the initial premise inaccurate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
