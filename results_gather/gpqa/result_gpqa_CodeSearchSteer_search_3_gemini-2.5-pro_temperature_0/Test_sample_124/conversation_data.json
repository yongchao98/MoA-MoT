    "The quantum mechanical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground state (lowest energy):** $n=0$, $E_0 = (0 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (3/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** $n=1$, $E_1 = (1 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (5/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** $n=2$, $E_2 = (2 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (7/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** $n=3$, $E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. The degeneracy, $g_n$, for a given principal quantum number $n$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is calculated by the formula:\n\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula gives:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nThis means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the energy eigenvalue of $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$. These correspond to the different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2), and (1,1,1).\n\nBased on this analysis, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
