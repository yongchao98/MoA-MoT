    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Assume a Uniform Stellar Distribution:** We start with the assumption that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (ρ), is constant.\n\n2.  **Consider a Spherical Shell:** Imagine a thin spherical shell of space with a radius *d* from Earth and a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*).\n    *   dV = 4πd² * dd\n\n3.  **Count the Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars (*dN*) within this shell is the product of the constant star density (ρ) and the volume of the shell (*dV*).\n    *   dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n\n4.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:** Stellar parallax (*plx*) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    *   d = 1 / plx\n    *   Therefore, plx = 1 / d\n\n5.  **Relate Thickness in Distance to Thickness in Parallax:** We need to express the shell's thickness *dd* in terms of a change in parallax, *d(plx)*. We can do this by differentiating the distance equation with respect to parallax.\n    *   d = 1 / plx\n    *   Taking the derivative: dd/d(plx) = -1 / plx²\n    *   When considering a small range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign: dd = (1 / plx²) * d(plx)\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now, we substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* back into our equation for the number of stars, *dN*.\n    *   Original equation: dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n    *   Substitute d = 1/plx: dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd\n    *   Substitute dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx): dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n    *   Combine the terms: dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is dN/d(plx). We can rearrange the final equation to find this.\n    *   dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
