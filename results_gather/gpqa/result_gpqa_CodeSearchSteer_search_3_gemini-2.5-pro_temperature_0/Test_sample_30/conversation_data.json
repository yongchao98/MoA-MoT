    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\nToluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the toluene ring is an ortho-, para-director. This means it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to it. Due to steric hindrance at the ortho position, the major product is the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination of reagents is a strong oxidizing agent. While several outcomes are possible, the most logical transformation in a multi-step synthesis problem is the oxidation of the methyl group. A patent describes the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene to p-nitrobenzaldehyde. Oxidation to the carboxylic acid is also possible, but the subsequent reaction with acetone strongly suggests an aldehyde is needed.\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The sodium hydroxide removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which lacks α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense. The initial addition product quickly dehydrates (loses a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated system.\n\n*   **Reaction:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde + acetone → (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Product 3:** The structure is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This product is a chalcone derivative.\n\n### Step 4: Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we must analyze the symmetry elements of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a para-substituted nitrobenzene ring connected to a trans (E) α,β-unsaturated ketone chain (-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃).\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the extensive system of sp² hybridized atoms and conjugation, the molecule is largely planar. The benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group all lie in the same plane.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no rotation axes (other than the trivial C₁). A 180° rotation (C₂) would not leave the molecule unchanged because the nitro group on one side is different from the acetyl group on the other.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Assuming the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the atoms is a plane of symmetry. This is the only symmetry element present besides the identity.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
