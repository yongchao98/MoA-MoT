    "The physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's magnetic moment `μ` (which is proportional to its spin `S`, `μ = γS`) is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Change of Field**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The magnetic moment, which was pointing in the Z direction, now finds itself in a magnetic field pointing along the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Precession**: The magnetic field `B` exerts a torque on the magnetic moment `μ`, causing the magnetic moment vector to rotate, or precess, around the new field direction (+Y axis).\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-component**: As the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. Since the initial moment was entirely along the Z-axis, it starts at its maximum value and then decreases, passes through zero, reaches a minimum (pointing in the -Z direction), and then returns to its initial state. This periodic change is an oscillation.\n\n5.  **Frequency Calculation**: The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ω`, and is given by the formula:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle, a constant that relates its magnetic moment to its angular momentum.\n    *   `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe expectation value (or average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`, will oscillate according to the equation:\n`<μz(t)> = <μz(0)> * cos(ωt) = <μz(0)> * cos(γBt)`\n\nThe angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` in the cosine function, which is `γB`. This corresponds to the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
