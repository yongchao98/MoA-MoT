    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2).\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n    Since the planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. The problem states that they have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/4) / (1/a2)^(1/4)` -> This is incorrect. The exponent is 1/2.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) and Doppler Shift:** The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two planets is:\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ2 / λ_0) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n    `K1 / K2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\n4.  **Relating RV to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is `v_p = (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)`.\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for K:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2) = (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (M_star^(1/2) * a^(1/2))`\n    *Note: This assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass and that the orbital inclination is ~90° (sin(i)≈1), which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet.*\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    `a^(1/2) ≈ (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (K * M_star^(1/2))`\n    `a ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    `a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (K1^2 * M_star)]`\n    The terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n7.  **Substituting the Known Ratios:**\n    *   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5 / 7`\n    *   RV ratio: `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4`\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
