    "A dominant-negative mutation produces an altered protein that not only is non-functional itself but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the other allele. In the case of a protein that must form a dimer to function, the presence of the mutant Y subunit disrupts the activity of the wild-type (WT) subunits.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the scenario and the options:\n*   **The core problem:** The Y mutation is in the dimerization domain. This mutant subunit (Y) can still interact with a wild-type subunit (WT), forming a WT-Y heterodimer. However, this resulting dimer is non-functional. This \"poisons\" the pool of WT subunits, preventing them from forming functional WT-WT dimers and leading to an overall loss of function, which is the hallmark of a dominant-negative effect.\n*   **Analyzing the options:**\n    *   **A) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** A mutation that disrupts proper dimerization can lead to misfolded proteins that clump together, or aggregate. These aggregates can sequester the wild-type protein, preventing it from functioning and leading to its degradation. This causes a loss-of-function phenotype and is a known mechanism for dominant-negative effects.\n    *   **B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** The formation of a non-functional or misfolded WT-Y dimer can trigger the cell's quality control system, known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). This process would lead to the degradation of the entire complex, including the wild-type subunit. This effectively removes the functional wild-type protein from the cell, causing a loss-of-function. This is also a well-established mechanism for dominant-negative mutations.\n    *   **C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. If the mutation completely prevented dimerization, the mutant subunits could not interfere with the wild-type subunits. The wild-type subunits would be free to form functional WT-WT dimers, likely resulting in a wild-type or near-wild-type phenotype. This would be a recessive mutation, not a dominant-negative one.\n    *   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** A dominant-negative mutation is a type of loss-of-function mutation, not a gain-of-function. It inhibits the normal function, rather than creating a new or enhanced one.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth protein aggregation (A) and protein degradation (B) are plausible and interconnected mechanisms for a dominant-negative mutation that affects dimerization. The formation of improper dimers can lead to misfolding, which in turn can cause either aggregation or targeted degradation by the cell's quality control machinery. Often, aggregation and subsequent degradation occur together. Both options describe a valid molecular basis for the observed dominant-negative, loss-of-function phenotype. However, protein aggregation is a very common consequence of mutations that affect protein-protein interactions and folding, often leading to the sequestration and subsequent degradation of the wild-type protein.\n\nGiven the options, both A and B describe likely molecular events. In many real-world examples, aggregation and degradation are linked. For instance, misfolded protein aggregates are often targeted for degradation. Both choices represent a more specific molecular mechanism than simply stating \"interference.\" Between the two, protein aggregation is a direct structural consequence of faulty dimerization that can trap the wild-type protein, making it a very likely phenotype.\n\n<<<A>>>"
