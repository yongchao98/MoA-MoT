    "To determine the joint probability, we must analyze the initial and final states of the two-electron system in terms of their angular momentum quantum numbers.\n\n### Analysis of the System State\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by the ket `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l₁ = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p orbital).\n    *   `l₂ = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p orbital).\n    *   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Measurement and Final State**: A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed. We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalues `-ħ` for both.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` corresponds to the quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₂z` corresponds to the quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   This corresponds to the uncoupled state `|l₁, m₁>|l₂, m₂> = |1, -1>|1, -1>`.\n\n### The Role of Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients\n\nThe connection between the coupled state `|l, m>` and the uncoupled basis states `|m₁, m₂>` is described by the Clebsch-Gordan expansion. The probability of finding the system in a specific uncoupled state `|m₁, m₂>` after measurement is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, `|<l₁, m₁, l₂, m₂ | l, m>|²`.\n\n### Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed as:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nLet's check if this condition is met for the desired outcome:\n*   The initial state has `m = -1`.\n*   The desired final state has `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   The sum for the final state is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\nSince the total z-component of the initial state (`m = -1`) is not equal to the sum of the z-components of the desired final state (`m₁ + m₂ = -2`), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero.\n\n` <1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0 `\n\nThe probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also zero. This means it is impossible to measure `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` simultaneously when the system is in the state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both `L₁z` and `L₂z` as `-ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>"
