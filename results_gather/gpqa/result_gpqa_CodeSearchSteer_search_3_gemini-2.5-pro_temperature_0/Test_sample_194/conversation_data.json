    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum possible orbital period for the second planet (Planet 2) such that it still produces both transit and occultation events. For a planet in a circular orbit, if it transits the star (passes in front), it will also be occulted by the star (pass behind). Therefore, the core of the problem is to find the maximum orbital distance at which a transit can still occur.\n\n2.  **Define the Transit Condition:** A transit occurs when a planet's orbit takes it between its star and an observer. The geometry of this event is described by the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. For the center of the planet to pass in front of the star's disk, the impact parameter must be `b ≤ 1`. The maximum possible impact parameter for such a transit is therefore `b_max = 1`.\n\n3.  **Relate Impact Parameter to Orbital Distance:** The impact parameter (`b`) is determined by the star's radius (`R_s`), the planet's semi-major axis (`a`), and the orbital inclination (`i`) using the formula: `b = (a / R_s) * cos(i)`. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination `i`. The star's radius `R_s` is also constant for the system. This means that for this system, the impact parameter `b` is directly proportional to the semi-major axis `a`.\n\n4.  **Use Ratios to Simplify the Problem:** We can establish a ratio between the parameters of the two planets.\n    *   For Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 / R_s) * cos(i)`\n    *   For Planet 2: `b2 = (a2 / R_s) * cos(i)`\n\n    By dividing the second equation by the first, we get:\n    `(a2 / a1) = (b2 / b1)`\n\n    This powerful simplification means we don't need to calculate the star's radius or the specific orbital inclination.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Maximum Orbital Distance Ratio:** We are given the impact parameter for Planet 1, `b1 = 0.2`. To find the maximum orbital period for Planet 2, we need to find its maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`), which corresponds to its maximum possible impact parameter (`b2_max`). As established in step 2, the limiting impact parameter for a transit to occur is `b2_max = 1`.\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio of the maximum semi-major axis of Planet 2 to the semi-major axis of Planet 1:\n    `(a2_max / a1) = (b2_max / b1) = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\n    This shows that the second planet can be at most 5 times farther from the star than the first planet and still produce a transit.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (`P`) of a planet to its semi-major axis (`a`). The law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). In ratio form for two planets orbiting the same star, this is expressed as: `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Maximum Period:** We can now solve for the maximum period of Planet 2 (`P2_max`) using the known period of Planet 1 (`P1 = 3` days) and the semi-major axis ratio we just calculated.\n\n    *   `P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)`\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    *   `P2_max = 3 * 5 * sqrt(5)`\n    *   `P2_max ≈ 3 * 5 * 2.236`\n    *   `P2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days.\n\nNote that the radii of the planets and the star were not needed for this calculation because of the use of ratios and the standard definition of the transit condition (`b ≤ 1`).\n\n<<<B>>>"
