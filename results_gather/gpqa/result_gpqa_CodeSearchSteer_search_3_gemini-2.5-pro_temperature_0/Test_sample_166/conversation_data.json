    "To calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state, we use the relative entropy measure. The final answer is derived through a step-by-step calculation based on the provided formulas and parameters.\n\n### 1. Defining the State\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n\nWith the specified values:\n*   `phi = -pi / 4`\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n\nFirst, we determine the components of the state vector:\n*   `cos(-pi / 4) = 1 / sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(-pi / 4) = -1 / sqrt(2)`\n\nThe normalization constant `N` is calculated as:\n*   `sin(2 * phi) = sin(-pi / 2) = -1`\n*   `N^2 = 1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2) = 1 - exp(-2 * 0.5^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5)`\n*   `N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5))`\n\nSubstituting these into the state equation gives us the \"odd\" cat state:\n`|psi> = (1 / sqrt(2) * N) * (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`\n\n### 2. The Measure of Non-Gaussianity\nThe non-Gaussianity `del_b` is defined as the relative entropy between the state `rho` and a reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`del_b = S(rho || tau) = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(rho * ln(tau))`\n\nA more common and equivalent definition for the non-Gaussianity measure is `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`, where `S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho))` is the von Neumann entropy.\n\n*   **Entropy of the state `rho`**: Since `|psi>` is a pure state, its density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is `S(rho) = 0`.\n*   **Reference Gaussian state `tau`**: This state is chosen to have the same first and second moments (mean and covariance matrix) as `rho`.\n*   Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue `nu`, which is calculated from the determinant of its covariance matrix `V`. The formula for the entropy is:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  **First Moments (Mean Displacement)**: For the odd cat state, the mean displacement is zero. `<q> = 0` and `<p> = 0`.\n2.  **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix)**: We need to calculate the mean photon number `<n>` and the expectation value `<a^2>`.\n    *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n3.  **Numerical Evaluation**:\n    *   `alpha = 0.5`, so `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n    *   `exp(-2 * alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653`.\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * (1 + exp(-0.5)) / (1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ 0.25 * (1.60653 / 0.39347) ≈ 1.0207`.\n    *   The covariance matrix `V` is diagonal, with elements determined by `<n>` and `<a^2>`. The determinant is `det(V) = (1/4) * ((2<n> + 1)^2 - (alpha^2)^2)`.\n    *   `det(V) ≈ 0.25 * ((2 * 1.0207 + 1)^2 - 0.25^2) = 0.25 * (3.0414^2 - 0.0625) ≈ 0.25 * (9.2501 - 0.0625) ≈ 2.2969`.\n4.  **Symplectic Eigenvalue `nu`**:\n    *   `nu = sqrt(det(V)) ≈ sqrt(2.2969) ≈ 1.5155`.\n5.  **Entropy `S(tau)`**:\n    *   `S(tau) ≈ (1.5155 + 0.5) * ln(2.0155) - (1.5155 - 0.5) * ln(1.0155)`\n    *   `S(tau) ≈ 2.0155 * 0.7009 - 1.0155 * 0.0154`\n    *   `S(tau) ≈ 1.4127 - 0.0156 ≈ 1.3971`.\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 1.40. Comparing this with the given options, the closest value is 1.38. The minor discrepancy can be attributed to rounding in the options or slight variations in the definitions used in different literature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
