    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the temperature it would reach if it were a perfect blackbody heated solely by its parent star. The formula is derived from the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated by the planet. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance from its star.\n\nThis relationship can be expressed as:\nT_eq ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4) = d^(-1/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\nT_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (d_p4 / d_p2)^(-1/2) = (d_p2 / d_p4)^(1/2)\n\nWhere `d_p2` and `d_p4` are the orbital distances of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, and since they orbit the same star, other factors in the full equilibrium temperature equation cancel out.\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For the circular orbits mentioned in the problem, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital distance (d).\n\nThe law can be written as:\nP² ∝ d³\n\nFrom this, we can establish a relationship for the distances of the two planets based on their orbital periods:\n(d_p2 / d_p4)³ = (P_p2 / P_p4)²\nd_p2 / d_p4 = (P_p2 / P_p4)^(2/3)\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the distance ratio from Kepler's Third Law into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = [ (P_p2 / P_p4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\nT_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (P_p2 / P_p4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. From this, we can identify the period values for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   P_p2 = 2\n*   P_p4 = 3.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of their periods:\nP_p2 / P_p4 = 2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.5714\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures:\nT_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
