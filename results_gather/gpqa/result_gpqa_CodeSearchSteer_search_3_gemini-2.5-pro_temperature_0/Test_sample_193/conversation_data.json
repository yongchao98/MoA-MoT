    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Since each of the three spins can take a value of +1 or -1, there are a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the equation:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states:\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   **State 1:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E₁ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State 2:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThere are 2 states with an energy of -3J.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are in one direction and one spin is in the opposite direction.**\n*   **State 3:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n    E₃ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 4:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n    E₄ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 5:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E₅ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 6:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E₆ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 7:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n    E₇ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 8:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n    E₈ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are 6 states with an energy of J.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states:\nZ = Σᵢ e^(-βEᵢ)\n\nWe can group the states by their energy levels and degeneracies (the number of states with the same energy):\n*   Energy E₁ = -3J has a degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   Energy E₂ = J has a degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function is then calculated as:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nC) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
