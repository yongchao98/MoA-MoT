    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Normalize the state |α>**\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|α'>`.\n`|α'> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nTo normalize it, we need to find a constant C such that `|α> = C|α'>` and `<α|α> = 1`.\nThe inner product `<α'|α'>` is:\n`<α'|α'> = <(1+i)up + (2-i)down | (1+i)up + (2-i)down>`\nSince `|up>` and `|down>` are orthonormal, `<up|up> = 1`, `<down|down> = 1`, and `<up|down> = <down|up> = 0`.\n`<α'|α'> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`<α'|α'> = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant C is `1/sqrt(<α'|α'>)`, so `C = 1/√7`.\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n**2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` if `i = j`. This gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nNote that this is `(hbar/2) * σ_x`, where `σ_x` is the Pauli X matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ = ± hbar/2`\n\nSo, the two eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y] = (hbar/2) * [x, y]`\n    `[y, x] = [x, y]`, which implies `x = y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`. Normalizing it gives `(1/√2) * [1, 1]`.\n    So, `|v₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y] = -(hbar/2) * [x, y]`\n    `[y, x] = [-x, -y]`, which implies `y = -x`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`. Normalizing it gives `(1/√2) * [1, -1]`.\n    So, `|v₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**3. Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|v_i>` is given by `P_i = |<v_i|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability P₁ (for eigenvalue λ₁ = +hbar/2):**\n    `<v₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n    `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability P₂ (for eigenvalue λ₂ = -hbar/2):**\n    `<v₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Calculate the average value of the operator**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of A is given by `<A> = Σ P_i * λ_i`.\n`<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
