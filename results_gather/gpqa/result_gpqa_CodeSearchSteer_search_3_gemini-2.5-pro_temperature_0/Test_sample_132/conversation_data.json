    "The initial calculations and the proposed method are sound. The search results confirm that for a phosphate buffer system composed of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should be used with the pKa2 value to determine the pH or the [H+] of the solution. Once the hydrogen ion concentration is known, the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) can be found using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation of phosphoric acid (Ka3). The search results did not provide a direct calculation for this specific problem but validated the general chemical principles. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the molar amounts of the buffer components.**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (which provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H2PO4-) = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (which provides the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO4^2-) = Mass / Molar Mass\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Volume in Liters\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**.\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.\n    *   The equilibrium constant expression is Ka2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-].\n    *   Rearranging for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]).\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration.**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is the third dissociation of phosphoric acid: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.\n    *   The equilibrium constant expression is Ka3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-].\n    *   Rearranging for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nNow, applying the given values:\n\n*   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g\n*   Molar Mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g\n*   Molar Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Volume = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L\n*   Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8\n*   Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Moles and Concentrations**\n\n*   Moles KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Moles Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate [H+]**\n\n*   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * 1.308\n*   [H+] = 8.1096 x 10^-8 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-]**\n\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.1096 x 10^-8 M)\n*   [PO4^3-] = (5.0562 x 10^-14) / (8.1096 x 10^-8)\n*   [PO4^3-] = 6.235 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
