    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identifying Hydrocarbon Z\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon is given by the formula: `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 g/mol) and Hydrogen (≈1 g/mol), we can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = `(2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. This equation does not yield an integer `n` for 14.28%.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = `(2n) / (14n)` = `2 / 14` = `1 / 7` ≈ 0.142857.\n*   This matches the given value of 14.28%. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all other compounds. This points to a very stable and common cycloalkane. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a prime candidate, as it is a widely used solvent and is the most stable six-carbon cycloalkane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Components of Mixture Y\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z. Let the components of Y be Z and another substance, D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it could be a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) or an aromatic compound. Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water without a catalyst and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y is described as a disproportionation. A classic example of a disproportionation reaction involving cyclic compounds is the conversion of a cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene into a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound. For instance, cyclohexene can disproportionate to form cyclohexane and benzene. This strongly suggests that the other component (D) is benzene (C6H6).\n*   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This mixture is equimolar and its components fit the description.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Components of Mixture X and Solving the Question\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer (a form of disproportionation), where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in products (Mixture Y) = H atoms in Cyclohexane + H atoms in Benzene\n    *   Total H atoms in Y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (Mixture X) must also be 18.\n    *   Total H atoms in X = H atoms in molecule A + H atoms in molecule B = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the reaction, this number is 18.\n\nTo confirm this is a plausible scenario, we can identify potential structures for A and B:\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B must yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies A and B are C6 cyclic compounds.\n*   A and B are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n*   A likely pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Total hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C6 rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene). In this reaction, the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene, a chemically sound process under catalytic conditions.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
