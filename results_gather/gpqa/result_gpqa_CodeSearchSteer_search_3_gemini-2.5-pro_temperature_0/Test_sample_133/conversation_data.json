    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Moles of H+ and OH- Ions\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from H2SO4:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H2SO4 is a diprotic strong acid, it provides 2 moles of H+ per mole of H2SO4.\n    *   Moles of H+ = 2 * 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n*   **Total Moles of H+:**\n    *   Total H+ = 0.1 mol (from HCl) + 0.18 mol (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it provides 2 moles of OH- per mole of Ba(OH)2.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol\n\n### 2. Heat from Neutralization (H+ + OH- → H2O)\n\nThe neutralization reaction is limited by the reactant with the fewer moles, which is the hydroxide ion (OH-).\n\n*   **Limiting Reactant:** OH- (0.2 mol)\n*   **Moles of water formed:** 0.2 mol\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   **Heat of Neutralization (ΔH_neut):**\n    *   ΔH_neut = 0.2 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\n### 3. Heat from Precipitation (Ba²+ + SO₄²⁻ → BaSO₄)\n\nA precipitation reaction also occurs between the barium ions from Ba(OH)2 and the sulfate ions from H2SO4.\n\n*   **Moles of Ba²+:** 0.1 mol (from 0.1 mol of Ba(OH)2)\n*   **Moles of SO₄²⁻:** 0.09 mol (from 0.09 mol of H2SO4)\n*   The precipitation is limited by the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻).\n*   **Moles of BaSO4 precipitate formed:** 0.09 mol\n*   The enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO4 is approximately -4.66 kcal/mol.\n*   **Heat of Precipitation (ΔH_precip):**\n    *   ΔH_precip = 0.09 mol * (-4.66 kcal/mol) = -0.4194 kcal\n\n### 4. Total Enthalpy of Neutralization\n\nThe total enthalpy change is the sum of the heat released from the neutralization and the precipitation reactions.\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy (ΔH_total):**\n    *   ΔH_total = ΔH_neut + ΔH_precip\n    *   ΔH_total = -2.74 kcal + (-0.4194 kcal)\n    *   ΔH_total = -3.1594 kcal\n\nThis calculated value of -3.1594 kcal is closest to option C, -2.72 kcal. The discrepancy might arise from using slightly different standard enthalpy values in the problem's source. However, based on standard values, the calculation points towards C being the most plausible answer, as the heat from precipitation is a secondary contribution. If we only consider the heat of neutralization (-2.74 kcal), option C is the nearest choice.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options.\nA) -3.80 kcal\nB) -16.0 kJ\nC) -2.72 kcal\nD) -11.42 kcal\n\nOur calculated heat of neutralization alone is -2.74 kcal, which is very close to -2.72 kcal. It's possible the question primarily considers the neutralization aspect, or uses a slightly different value for the standard enthalpy.\n\nLet's check the other options.\n-11.42 kcal would correspond to the neutralization of 0.83 moles of water, which is incorrect.\n-16.0 kJ is equivalent to -3.82 kcal, which is close to option A.\n\nLet's re-calculate the heat of neutralization in kJ:\nΔH_neut = 0.2 mol * (-57.1 kJ/mol) = -11.42 kJ. This is not among the options.\n\nLet's re-calculate the heat of precipitation in kJ. I need the value in kJ/mol.\n-4.66 kcal/mol * 4.184 kJ/kcal = -19.5 kJ/mol.\nΔH_precip = 0.09 mol * (-19.5 kJ/mol) = -1.755 kJ.\n\nTotal heat in kJ = -11.42 kJ + (-1.755 kJ) = -13.175 kJ. This is not close to -16.0 kJ.\n\nGiven the options, the value of -2.72 kcal is the most reasonable answer, representing the heat of neutralization of 0.2 moles of water, with minor variations due to standard values used.\n\nFinal calculation check:\nMoles H+ = 0.28 mol\nMoles OH- = 0.20 mol\nMoles H2O formed = 0.20 mol\nHeat of neutralization = 0.20 mol * -13.7 kcal/mol = -2.74 kcal.\nThis is closest to -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
