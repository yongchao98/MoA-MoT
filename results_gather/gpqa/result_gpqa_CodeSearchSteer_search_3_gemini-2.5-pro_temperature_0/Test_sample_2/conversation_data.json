    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we can calculate the expectation values of σ_z and σ_x separately and then combine them.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator A for a state |ψ⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.\n\n1.  **Calculate the expectation value of σ_z (⟨σ_z⟩):**\n    The σ_z operator has the eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.\n    ⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩\n    Applying σ_z to |ψ⟩:\n    σ_z|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * (+1)|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 * (-1)|↓⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩\n    Now, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩:\n    ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n    Using the orthogonality of the states (⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1, ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0, ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0):\n    ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) - ((√3)/2 * (√3)/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n2.  **Calculate the expectation value of σ_x (⟨σ_x⟩):**\n    The σ_x operator acts on the basis states as follows: σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.\n    ⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩\n    Applying σ_x to |ψ⟩:\n    σ_x|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * |↓⟩ + (√3)/2 * |↑⟩\n    Now, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩:\n    ⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ((√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)\n    ⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5 * (√3)/2) + ((√3)/2 * 0.5) = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = 2(√3)/4 = (√3)/2\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value of the full operator:**\n    The expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x is:\n    ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n    ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * ((√3)/2)\n    ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    Using the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n    ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n    ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n    ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place, we get -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
