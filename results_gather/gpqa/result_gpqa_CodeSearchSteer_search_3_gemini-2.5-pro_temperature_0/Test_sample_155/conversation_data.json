    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is preserved in the epoxide product. (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. Epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation occurs from either face of the double bond at equal rates, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The treatment of an epoxide with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the ring to form a 1,2-diol (a glycol). This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-like process that occurs with *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4S,5S)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The two products, (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same achiral molecule due to a center of symmetry. This type of achiral diastereomer is called a **meso compound**. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the epoxide to the *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, produces the *cis*-epoxide. This product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *anti*-addition of water to the achiral *meso*-epoxide can occur by attacking either of the two epoxide carbons. These two carbons are enantiotopic.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is known as a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, which is a combination of the products from both reactions, contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture is then analyzed by two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two isomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
