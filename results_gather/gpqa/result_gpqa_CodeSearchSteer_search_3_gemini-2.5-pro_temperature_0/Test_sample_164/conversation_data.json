    "After a thorough review of the scientific and industrial literature concerning ethylene polymerization, here is an evaluation of the four statements:\n\n*   **A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This statement is **correct**. Major chemical companies in the US, such as Univation Technologies (a joint venture of ExxonMobil and Dow) and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have commercialized dual-catalyst or multi-component catalyst systems. These systems, with trade names like PRODIGY™ and MarTECH™ ADL (Advanced Dual Loop), are used in single or dual-reactor processes to produce polyethylene with tailored properties, including bimodal molecular weight distributions and in-situ comonomer incorporation.\n\n*   **B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** This statement is **incorrect**. The essential additional step is the oligomerization of ethylene to form α-olefins (e.g., 1-hexene, 1-octene), which act as comonomers to create branches. Numerous research papers and patents describe tandem catalyst systems where an oligomerization catalyst is successfully activated by an aluminum-based compound, most commonly methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified versions of it.\n\n*   **C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This statement is **correct**. Group VIa (Group 6) contains chromium (Cr), which is a key element in this field. Specific chromium-based catalyst systems, activated by compounds like alkylaluminum or aluminoxanes, are highly effective and selective for the trimerization of ethylene into 1-hexene. This selective formation of 1-hexene is a crucial industrial method for producing the comonomer needed to introduce regular, short-chain branches into the polyethylene backbone.\n\n*   **D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** This statement is plausible but less definitively supported as the primary reason for their non-use compared to the certainty of the other statements. Research has shown that noble metals like palladium can catalyze the formation of highly branched polyethylene from ethylene. [18 from first search] While it is a general principle in industrial chemistry that noble metal catalysts are significantly more expensive than catalysts based on base metals like chromium or iron, the literature found does not explicitly state that cost is the sole prohibitive factor for this specific application on an industrial scale.\n\nBoth statements A and C are factually correct. However, statement C describes a fundamental chemical principle—the type of catalyst that enables the key transformation—which is a prerequisite for the industrial implementation described in statement A. The development of selective chromium (Group VIa) oligomerization catalysts was a critical scientific breakthrough that made these advanced tandem polymerization systems commercially viable. Therefore, in a scientific context, statement C is a more fundamental and precise truth about the chemistry involved.\n\n<<<C>>>"
