    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The \"laboratory frame\" is the stationary observer's frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The \"glass frame\" is the frame of reference moving along with the glass (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Determine the known velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S'), is determined by the index of refraction, `n`. The formula for the index of refraction is `n = c / u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum and `u'` is the speed of light in the medium.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass itself is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.**\n    The formula to find the velocity (`u`) of an object in frame S when its velocity in frame S' (`u'`) and the velocity of frame S' relative to S (`v`) are known is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula.**\n    *   `u'` (speed of light in the glass's frame) = `1/n`\n    *   `v` (speed of the glass frame) = `v`\n    *   `c` (speed of light in vacuum) = `1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the expression, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result matches the formula derived for the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water and was a key experiment in the development of special relativity.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1+n*v)/(n+v) - Matches the derived speed.\nB) (1-n*v)/(n+v) - Incorrect.\nC) (1+n*v)/(n-v) - Incorrect.\nD) 1 - Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
