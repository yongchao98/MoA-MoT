    "The problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows the use of this equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation for the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels, `a` and `b`, is given by:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the higher energy state `b` and lower energy state `a`, respectively.\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant, which has a value of approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the ratio of excited atoms for each star:\n*   For star 1 with temperature T_1: (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n*   For star 2 with temperature T_2: (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means:\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_b / g_a) is the same for both stars since the same iron atom energy levels are being considered, so it cancels out:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the relationship between the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\nln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
