    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state is governed by quantum mechanical selection rules for dipole transitions. This problem involves a two-step cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the First Transition\n\nThe initial state is |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩. According to the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n*   The principal quantum number *n* is not strictly constrained but must decrease for a decay.\n\nFor the first transition from |3,0,0⟩:\n*   Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   The problem specifies a cascade through the n=2 shell, so the intermediate state will have *n'* = 2.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Second Transition\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. Let's check if this is allowed by the selection rules:\n*   Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed change.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1. This is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the decay.\n\nFor the first step, the atom decays from a spherically symmetric state (*l*=0). In such cases, the transition probabilities to each of the possible *m'* states of the next *l* level are equal. Since there are three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩), the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nFor the second step, consider the decay from the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩. The atom must decay to a lower energy level, which is the n=1 ground state. The only possible state in the n=1 shell is |1,0,0⟩ (since *l* must be less than *n*). Therefore, the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ occurs with a probability of 1, as it is the only available decay channel.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n*   P(total) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n*   P(total) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\nThis matches the path and probability given in option A. The other options list either incorrect probabilities for their respective valid paths or an incorrect probability for the path in option A.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>"
