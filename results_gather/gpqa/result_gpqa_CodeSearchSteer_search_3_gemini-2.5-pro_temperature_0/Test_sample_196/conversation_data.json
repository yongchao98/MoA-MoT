    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   Two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is next to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n        *   2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H): A proton on a carbon attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position).\n        *   1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H): A CH₂ group.\n        *   1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H): A CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n        *   0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H): A CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   This fragmentation pattern—a CH, a CH₂, a CH₃ doublet, and a CH₃ triplet—is characteristic of a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\nCombining these findings, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction and Final Product\n\nCompound X reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent known to completely reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. The reaction involves the reduction of the carboxyl group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general transformation is R-COOH → R-CH₃.\n\nApplying this to the starting material:\n*   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Red P / HI\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n\nThe final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectroscopic analysis and the known reactivity of red phosphorus and HI, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
