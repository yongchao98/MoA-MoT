    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. Analyzing these conditions reveals the correct statement among the given options.\n\nThe key assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-carrier device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) contributes to the current.\n*   **Trap-free solid:** The semiconductor or insulator is assumed to be free of traps or energetic disorder, which could capture the charge carriers and limit the current.\n*   **Ohmic contacts:** The contacts to the device must be Ohmic, meaning they allow for the free injection of charge carriers into the material without a significant energy barrier. This is also described as having no carrier injection barrier. A Schottky contact, which has a barrier, would invalidate this assumption.\n*   **Drift-dominated current:** The model assumes that the current is primarily driven by the electric field (drift current) and that the contribution from the random thermal motion of carriers (diffusion current) is negligible.\n\nBased on these points, we can evaluate the given statements:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the law requires an Ohmic contact, not a Schottky contact which implies an injection barrier.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law describes a current that is dominated by drift, not one where the drift current is negligible.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect as the equation is derived for a single-carrier device.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately reflects the primary conditions for the Mott-Gurney law's validity: it applies to a trap-free material, involves a single type of charge carrier, requires a contact with no injection barrier (Ohmic), and assumes the current is dominated by drift (negligible diffusion).\n\n<<<D>>>"
