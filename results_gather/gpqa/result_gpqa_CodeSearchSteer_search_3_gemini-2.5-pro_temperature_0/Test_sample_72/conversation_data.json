    "### Calculation of Relative Speed and Total Energy in a Relativistic System\n\nTo determine the correct option, we must calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using the principles of special relativity.\n\n#### Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity addition (in this case, finding the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction) is:\n`v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (mass 3m), v1 = 0.5c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (mass 2m), v2 = 0.6c\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nThus, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n#### Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Astronaut 1 (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n2.  Calculate the energy (E1):\n    `E1 = γ1 * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464mc²`\n\n**Astronaut 2 (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n2.  Calculate the energy (E2):\n    `E2 = γ2 * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5mc²`\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n`E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 3.464mc² + 2.5mc² = 5.964mc²`\n\nThe total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ 0.14c\n*   Total energy (E) ≈ 5.96 mc²\n\nThese results correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
