    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of quantum mechanics regarding the measurement of an observable. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the state vector and the observable operator.**\n    The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (vector) `|ψ⟩`:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]\n    ```\n    The observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n    ```\n    P = [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]\n        [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]\n        [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvalues of the observable P.**\n    To find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n    ```\n    det([ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ], [ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ], [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]) = 0\n    ```\n    This simplifies to:\n    -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0\n    -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n    -λ³ + λ = 0\n    λ(1 - λ²) = 0\n    The eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\n3.  **Find the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = 0.**\n    The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0. We need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to λ = 0 by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n    Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]`.\n    ```\n    [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ] [x]   [0]\n    [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n    [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ] [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    This gives the equations:\n    *   (1/√2)y = 0  =>  y = 0\n    *   (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x = -z\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]`. Choosing c=1, we get `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    Now, we normalize this eigenvector:\n    ||v₀||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2\n    The normalized eigenvector `|λ₀⟩` is:\n    ```\n    |λ₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]\n    ```\n\n4.  **Normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`.**\n    The norm squared of the state vector is:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = ||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n    The normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n    ```\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]\n    ```\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is given by the Born rule, which states the probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the normalized eigenvector and the normalized state vector: `Prob(λ=0) = |⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    First, calculate the inner product `⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n    ```\n    ⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] . (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]\n    ```\n    ```\n    = (1/√12) * [(1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1)]\n    ```\n    ```\n    = (1/√12) * (-1 - 1)\n    ```\n    ```\n    = -2 / √12 = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3\n    ```\n    Finally, the probability is the square of the magnitude of this value:\n    ```\n    Prob(λ=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n    ```\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
