    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze Planet (a):** This is a baseline planet, identical to Earth in mass and radius. Its density is Earth's density, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Planet (b):** This planet has twice the mass of Earth, and its density is explicitly stated as approximately 5.5 g/cm³. This is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze Planet (d):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but only half the mass. With less mass, the force of its own gravity is weaker, leading to less self-compression. Therefore, its density will be *less* than Earth's density.\n\n4.  **Analyze Planet (c):** This planet also has the same composition as Earth but is five times more massive. The significantly greater mass results in a much stronger gravitational force, which compresses the planet's material. This gravitational compression increases the planet's overall density. For rocky planets of similar composition, density increases with mass. For instance, Earth is denser than Mercury, despite being made of lighter elements, because its larger mass causes greater compression. A planet five times the mass of Earth with the same composition will be considerably denser than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) has a density *less than* 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density *greater than* 5.51 g/cm³.\n\nTherefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses and the same composition as Earth will have the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
