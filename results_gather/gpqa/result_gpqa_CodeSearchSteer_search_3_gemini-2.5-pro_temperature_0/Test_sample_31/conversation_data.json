    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Components:**\n    *   The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n    *   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n2.  **Determine the Rest Mass (m₀):**\n    For this type of problem, it is common to approximate the rest mass of the nucleus by summing the rest masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, thereby ignoring the mass defect due to binding energy.\n    *   Mass of a single proton (mₚ) is approximately 1.007276 u.\n    *   Mass of a single neutron (mₙ) is approximately 1.008665 u.\n    *   The total rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\n        m₀ = 3 * mₚ + 3 * mₙ\n        m₀ = 3 * (1.007276 u) + 3 * (1.008665 u)\n        m₀ = 3.021828 u + 3.025995 u\n        m₀ = 6.047823 u\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀):**\n    The rest energy is calculated using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, E = mc². The conversion factor from atomic mass units (u) to Mega-electron Volts (MeV) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c² per u.\n    *   E₀ = m₀ * 931.5 MeV/u\n    *   E₀ = 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u\n    *   E₀ ≈ 5632.75 MeV\n    *   To convert to Giga-electron Volts (GeV), we divide by 1000:\n        E₀ ≈ 5.63275 GeV\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is determined by the speed (v) of the nucleus, which is given as 0.96c (where c is the speed of light).\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\n    The total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.63275 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.117 GeV\n\nThis calculated value of 20.117 GeV is closest to option A. The minor difference between the calculated value and the option is likely due to the use of slightly different values for the physical constants (mass of proton, neutron, or the amu-to-MeV conversion factor) when the problem was formulated.\n\n<<<A>>>"
