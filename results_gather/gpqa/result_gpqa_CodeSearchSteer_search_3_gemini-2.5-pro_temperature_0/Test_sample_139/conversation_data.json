    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K.\n2.  **Identify Substance G**: Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating. This indicates that G is a deuterated hydrate (a compound containing D₂O in its structure).\n3.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A simple molecule that fits this description is deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n4.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G. The problem states that X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is deuterium, D) and that it and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of substance X perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. For the reaction to produce deuterium gas (D₂), the other reactant must also be a source of deuterium. Therefore, liquid Y must be **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n5.  **Confirm the Reaction**: The reaction between Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y) is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    This reaction produces deuterium gas (W) and aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate (G). Heating Al(OD)₃ yields aluminum oxide and heavy water (B). This confirms the identities of all substances.\n6.  **Confirm the Final Clue**: The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This final clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass**: The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the lightest element, in the form of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass from the lightest element is 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminium. Aluminium's only stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu. The total mass from the heaviest element is 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
