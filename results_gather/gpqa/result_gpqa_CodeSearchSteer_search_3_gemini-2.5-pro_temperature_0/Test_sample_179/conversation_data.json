    "### Calculation of the Minimum Energy of the System\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. This can be divided into two main components:\n1.  The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe total energy `U_total` is given by the formula:\n`U_total = Σ (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij` for all pairs (i, j)\n\nWhere:\n*   `k` is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C².\n*   `q` is the charge of each particle, which is `2e`.\n*   `e` is the elementary charge, 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n*   `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j`.\n\nFirst, we calculate the constant factor `k * q²`:\n*   `q = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q² ≈ 1.0267876 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n*   `k * q² ≈ (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (1.0267876 × 10⁻³⁷) ≈ 9.2289 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m`\n\n#### 1. Energy of Interaction: Central Charge and Sphere Charges\n\nThe 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 charges are on a sphere of radius `r = 2 m` centered at P. The potential energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere is:\n`U_center-sphere = 12 * (k * q² / r)`\n`U_center-sphere = 12 * (k * q² / 2) = 6 * k * q²`\n`U_center-sphere ≈ 6 * (9.2289 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) = 5.53734 × 10⁻²⁷ J`\n\nThis energy component is constant regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere's surface.\n\n#### 2. Energy of Interaction: Charges on the Sphere\n\nTo find the minimum energy of the system, we must find the configuration of the 12 charges on the sphere that minimizes their mutual repulsion energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe interaction energy among these 12 charges requires calculating the distances between all pairs of vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r = 2 m`. There are 66 pairs in total. The distances between the vertices of an icosahedron fall into three distinct groups:\n*   **30 pairs** are separated by the edge length of the icosahedron, `d₁`.\n*   **30 pairs** are separated by a longer distance, `d₂`.\n*   **6 pairs** are antipodal and separated by the diameter of the sphere, `d₃`.\n\nThe distances are calculated as follows for a sphere of radius `r = 2 m`:\n*   `d₁ = 8 / √(10 + 2√5) ≈ 2.1029 m`\n*   `d₂ = d₁ * φ ≈ 3.4027 m`, where `φ` is the golden ratio `(1 + √5) / 2`.\n*   `d₃ = 2 * r = 4 m`\n\nThe potential energy for the charges on the sphere is the sum of the energies of all these pairs:\n`U_sphere-sphere = k * q² * (30/d₁ + 30/d₂ + 6/d₃)`\n`U_sphere-sphere ≈ (9.2289 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) * (30/2.1029 + 30/3.4027 + 6/4)`\n`U_sphere-sphere ≈ (9.2289 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) * (14.2659 + 8.8166 + 1.5)`\n`U_sphere-sphere ≈ (9.2289 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m) * (24.5825 m⁻¹) ≈ 2.2687 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\n#### Total Minimum Energy\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of the two components:\n`U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`\n`U_total ≈ 5.53734 × 10⁻²⁷ J + 2.2687 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n`U_total ≈ 0.5537 × 10⁻²⁶ J + 2.2687 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8224 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ Joules.\n\n<<<D>>>"
