    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.** The distance to a star (r) is inversely proportional to its parallax (plx). This fundamental relationship in astronomy can be written as r ∝ 1/plx, or more precisely, d = 1/p where d is the distance in parsecs and p is the parallax in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **State the given information.** The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    N ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.** Since r ∝ 1/plx, it follows that plx ∝ 1/r. We can substitute this into the given relationship:\n    N ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\n    N ∝ r⁵\n\n4.  **Interpret the \"number of stars\" (N).** In this context, N represents the cumulative number of stars observed out to a distance r. So, the total number of stars within a sphere of radius r is proportional to r⁵.\n\n5.  **Determine what the question is asking.** The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with r. This is not the total number of stars (N), but the rate at which the number of stars changes as the distance increases. In mathematical terms, this is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, or dN/dr.\n\n6.  **Calculate the derivative.** We have the relationship N ∝ r⁵. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, k:\n    N = k * r⁵\n\n    Now, we differentiate N with respect to r:\n    dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)\n    dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴\n\n7.  **State the final relationship.** The result of the differentiation shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r⁴.\n    dN/dr ∝ r⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as r⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>"
