    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that completely inactivates the protein encoded by that gene. Let's analyze the potential impact of each mutation.\n\n### Analysis of Mutations\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   The second codon, `TTT`, changes to `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   The second codon change (`TTT` to `TTC`) is silent.\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), changes to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to stop prematurely, resulting in a severely shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein. Since this stop codon appears at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), it is the most likely of all the options to completely eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains multiple changes compared to the intact gene, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (missense mutations). For example, `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr), and `ACT` (Thr) becomes `GTC` (Val). Like Mutant 1, these missense mutations might alter the protein, but they are less likely to completely inactivate it than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence also shows multiple missense mutations. The codon `CTC` (Leu) changes to `TAC` (Tyr), and `GGT` (Gly) changes to `GCT` (Ala). Similar to the other missense mutations, this is not the most reliable way to ensure the protein is non-functional.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence is the most effective way to produce a truncated, non-functional protein. Mutant 2 is the only one with this type of mutation. Therefore, it is the most probable choice to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
