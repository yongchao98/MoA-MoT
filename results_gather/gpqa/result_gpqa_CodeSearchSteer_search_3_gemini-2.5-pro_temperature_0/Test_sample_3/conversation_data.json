    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist, two of the fundamental Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for them.\n\nThe two affected equations are:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero (∇ ⋅ **B** = 0). This is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist, as magnetic field lines always form closed loops and never start or end at a single point. If magnetic monopoles did exist, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, so the divergence of **B** would be proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρm).\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law (∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t) describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a current of these magnetic charges (a magnetic current, **J**m) would also create a circulating electric field, adding a new term to the equation. This creates a beautiful symmetry with Ampère's Law, where an electric current creates a circulating magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the equations related to both the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<D>>>"
