    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the proper mean lifetime (τ)** of the particle from its given decay width (Γ_X). The relationship between these two quantities is derived from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**, which accounts for time dilation due to the particle's high velocity.\n3.  **Determine the particle's velocity (v)** as a fraction of the speed of light (c).\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d)** in the laboratory frame, which is the distance the particle travels on average before decaying.\n\nHere are the given values:\n*   Production energy (E_X) = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass (m_X) = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Decay width (Γ_X) = 320 MeV\n\nWe will also use the following physical constants:\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s.\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n**1. Proper Mean Lifetime (τ)**\n\nThe proper mean lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width. The formula is:\nτ = ħ / Γ_X\n\nPlugging in the values:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**2. Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy:\nγ = E_X / m_X\n\nPlugging in the values:\nγ = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV\nγ = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\n**3. Velocity (v)**\n\nThe velocity of the particle can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The Lorentz factor and velocity are related by:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nSolving for β = v/c:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²)\nβ = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400)\nβ ≈ 0.9887\n\n**4. Mean Decay Distance (d)**\n\nThe mean decay distance in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels during its dilated lifetime. The formula is:\nd = γ * v * τ = γ * β * c * τ\n\nPlugging in the calculated values:\nd ≈ (20/3) * 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nd ≈ 6.667 * 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nd ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
