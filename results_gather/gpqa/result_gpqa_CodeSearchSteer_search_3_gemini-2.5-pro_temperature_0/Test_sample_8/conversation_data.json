    "To determine which of the listed molecules has C3h symmetry, we must analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group requires a C3 principal rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis.\n\n*   **A) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)₃):** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. While the B(O)₃ core is planar and has a C3 axis, the isopropyl groups are not planar. Due to the free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds, the molecule can adopt various conformations. However, achieving a stable conformation with a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that reflects all atoms, including the hydrogens of the methyl groups, is unlikely. Therefore, it does not possess C3h symmetry.\n\n*   **B) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. The core is triphenylene, which has D3h symmetry. The addition of the three furan-dione rings maintains the C3 rotational symmetry. Because the entire molecule is planar, it possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that lies in the plane of the molecule. The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane places this molecule in the C3h point group.\n\n*   **C) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen bond. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Instead, it has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis. Therefore, quinuclidine belongs to the C3v point group, not C3h.\n\n*   **D) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings. The steric strain between the carbonyl groups of the adjacent anhydride rings forces the molecule out of planarity into a propeller-like shape. While it has a C3 axis, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it belongs to the C3 point group.\n\nBased on this analysis, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is the only molecule in the list that is planar and has a C3 axis, fulfilling the requirements for C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
