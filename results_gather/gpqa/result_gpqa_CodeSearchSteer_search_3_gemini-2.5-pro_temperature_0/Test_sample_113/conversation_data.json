    "### Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated to yield the final cyanohydrin product. For the protonation step to occur, a proton source is required. An acidic medium, represented by H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion), provides the necessary protons for this step. Often, this is achieved by the slow addition of a strong acid like HCl to the mixture of the ketone and sodium cyanide. Therefore, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n\n### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is typically carried out by heating the nitrile with water in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base. Among the given options, HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid that effectively catalyzes the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and would not be as effective for this conversion. Therefore, reagent B is HCl.\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<D>>>"
