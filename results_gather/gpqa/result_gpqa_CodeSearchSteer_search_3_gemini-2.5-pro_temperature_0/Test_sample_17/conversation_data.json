    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n### 1. Understand the Abundance Notation\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance of element X relative to element Y in a star, compared to the Sun. The formula is:\n`[X/Y] = log10(NX/NY)_star - log10(NX/NY)_sun`\nwhere `NX` and `NY` are the number of atoms of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\nA useful identity derived from this definition is:\n`[A/H] = [A/B] + [B/H]`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1\n\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the identity `[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`, we can calculate the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen for Star_1:\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nThis means:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun = 0.3`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2\n\nFor Star_2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the same identity, we can write `[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`. We need to find `[Si/H]_2`:\n`0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\nThis means:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_2 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun = -0.3`\n\n### 4. Determine the Ratio of Silicon Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. This is interpreted as the ratio of their silicon number abundances relative to hydrogen, which is `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\nLet's take the logarithm of this ratio:\n`log10 [ (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 ] = log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_2`\n\nWe can find this value by subtracting the equation for Star_2 from the equation for Star_1:\n`[ log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun ] - [ log10(nSi/nH)_2 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun ] = 0.3 - (-0.3)`\n\nThe `log10(nSi/nH)_sun` terms cancel out, leaving:\n`log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_2 = 0.6`\n\nSo, `log10 [ (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 ] = 0.6`.\n\nTo find the final ratio, we take the antilogarithm:\n`Ratio = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = 10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nThe information regarding the stellar masses, the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Equivalent Width (EW) method, and the specific solar abundances for Mg and Fe are contextual details about how such abundances are determined in astrophysics but are not required for this specific calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
