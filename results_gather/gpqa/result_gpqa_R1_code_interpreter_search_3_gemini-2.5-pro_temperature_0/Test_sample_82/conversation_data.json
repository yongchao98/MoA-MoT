    "This problem involves a two-step calculation: first, determining the pH at a point within the buffer region (25% titration), and second, determining the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\n*   The total volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water is:\n    *   Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is:\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acid remains.

We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base.\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\n*   First, we calculate the pKa of acetic acid:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and concentrations) of the conjugate base to the acid is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n    *   [A⁻]/[HA] = 1/3\n\n*   Now, we can calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The solution contains only the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻, which hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   First, determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   Next, calculate the total volume and the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   Now, calculate the pH of this 0.02 M acetate solution. The acetate ion hydrolyzes as follows:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   We can now find the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻], using the equilibrium expression for a weak base:\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   Finally, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n# Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Initial moles of acid = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol\nmoles_acid = 0.001\n# Volume of NaOH needed = moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L\nvol_NaOH = 0.01\n# Total volume at equivalence = diluted acid volume (0.040 L) + NaOH volume (0.01 L) = 0.050 L\ntotal_vol = 0.050\n# Concentration of acetate = moles / total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\nacetate_conc = 0.02\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * acetate_conc)\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\n<<<C>>>"
