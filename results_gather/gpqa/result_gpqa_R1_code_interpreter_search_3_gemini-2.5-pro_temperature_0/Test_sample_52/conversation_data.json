    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core of this part is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Data:** An ester group is present. An ester has the functional group -COO-, which contains one C=O double bond and one C-O single bond.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals implies symmetry. A 1,4- (para) substitution pattern is the most common arrangement that gives two distinct signals for the 4 aromatic protons (an AA'BB' system).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, giving a doublet (d). This fragment has the formula -C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl groups belongs to the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality. This could be a methyl ester (Ar-COO**CH3**) or an acetate ester (Ar-O-CO**CH3**).\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. It eliminates any possibility of having ethyl, propyl, or other straight-chain alkyl groups containing a -CH2- unit.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the building blocks of the molecule:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: C6H4\n*   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5\n*   An ester group containing a methyl group. Let's consider the two possibilities:\n    1.  A methyl ester group: -COOCH3 (formula C2H3O2)\n    2.  An acetate ester group: -OCOCH3 (formula C2H3O2)\n    Both possibilities for the ester part have the same formula: C2H3O2.\n\n**3. Calculate the Chemical Formula**\n\nNow, let's add the formulas of the fragments together to get the total molecular formula:\n*   From the benzene ring: C6H4\n*   From the propenyl group: C3H5\n*   From the ester part: C2H3O2\n\nTotal Formula = (C6H4) + (C3H5) + (C2H3O2) = C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C11H12O2**\n\n**4. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **DoU from structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n    *   Vinyl C=C bond = 1\n    *   Ester C=O bond = 1\n    *   **Total required DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n*   **DoU from formula C11H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\nThe DoU calculated from the formula matches the DoU required by the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n**5. Eliminate Other Options**\n\nLet's check why the other formulas are incorrect.\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This DoU only accounts for the benzene ring (4) and the ester C=O (1). It does not allow for the vinyl C=C bond, which is clearly indicated by the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. While the DoU matches, this formula is equivalent to our derived formula (C11H12O2) plus a CH2 group. The NMR spectrum explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**, making this formula impossible.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This formula requires an extra degree of unsaturation compared to what the NMR data suggests. It would require a more complex structure (e.g., another double bond or ring) that would not fit the simple NMR pattern described.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information (FTIR, 1H NMR constraints, and aromaticity) is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data for Substituents:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that these 4 protons give only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) arrangement.\n    *   **Vinyl-H and one -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) and a signal for a -CH3 group. This is a classic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Second -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows a second -CH3 signal. Since the FTIR indicates an ester group (-COO-), this methyl group must be part of the ester. The two possibilities are a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). In either case, this fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the formula.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that confirms we do not have any ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains with -CH2- units.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula:** Now, we sum the formulas of the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester group with methyl: C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Formula:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C11H12O2**\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   **DoU from the proposed structure:**\n        *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n        *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1\n        *   Ester C=O double bond = 1\n        *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6\n    *   **DoU from the calculated formula (C11H12O2):**\n        *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming that C11H12O2 is a valid formula for the described structure.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 5. Incorrect. This formula lacks the double bond of the propenyl group.\n    *   B) C11H12O2: DoU = 6. Correct. This matches our derived formula and all spectroscopic data.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. Incorrect. This formula contains an extra CH2 group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data (\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\").\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. Incorrect. This would require an extra ring or double bond not supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
