    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction. We have a ketone (the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a strong base (t-BuOK). The base will create a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The starting ketone is **2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n    *   We must identify the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O) and their protons.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with **no α-protons**.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically hindered. It will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position to form the enolate. The enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The enolate, with its nucleophilic character at C6, will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, **ethyl acrylate** (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond will form between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The attack, followed by protonation (during workup), adds a `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` group to the C6 position of the ketone.\n    *   To name the resulting product according to the options provided, we treat it as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The large cyclohexanone group is a substituent at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, we number the cyclohexanone ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n        *   The point of attachment (originally C6) is now **C1**. It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (originally C1) is now **C2**. It is an **oxo** group.\n        *   The quaternary carbon (originally C2) is now **C3**. It has an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The starting material is **1-nitropropane** (CH₃–CH₂–CH₂–NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group (–NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), will deprotonate the α-carbon (C1) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion), `CH₃–CH₂–CH⁻–NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃–CH=CH–CN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure after protonation is `NC–CH₂–CH(CH₃)–CH(NO₂)–CH₂–CH₃`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group, the nitrile (–CN).\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   C1: Nitrile carbon\n        *   C2: –CH₂–\n        *   C3: –CH– with a **methyl** substituent.\n        *   C4: –CH– with a **nitro** substituent.\n        *   C5: –CH₂–\n        *   C6: –CH₃\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael addition** reaction.

The negative charge will be delocalized between C6 and the oxygen atom, with a double bond forming between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The enolate is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon. It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The reaction proceeds via 1,4-conjugate addition.

This reaction involves the 1,4-addition of a nucleophile (a Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, which will form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen) and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will abstract the only available acidic proton from C6 to form a single, specific enolate. The negative charge will be delocalized between C6 and the oxygen atom, with a double bond forming between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The enolate is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon. It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The reaction proceeds via 1,4-conjugate addition. After the initial attack, the resulting enolate is protonated during the workup step to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The reaction adds a `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` group to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   To name the product, we can treat it as a substituted ethyl propanoate, as suggested by the options.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**. The large cyclohexanone ring acts as a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain (`substituent-CH₂(3)-CH₂(2)-C(=O)OEt(1)`).\n    *   Now, we must name the complex substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon of the substituent that is attached to the parent chain is numbered C1.\n        *   **C1** (the original C6 of the ketone) is attached to the propanoate chain and has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **C2** (the original C1 of the ketone) has the carbonyl group, so it's an **oxo** substituent.\n        *   **C3** (the original C2 of the ketone) has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition**.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is used to deprotonate the nitroalkane.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. For but-2-enenitrile (`C(4)H₃-C(3)H=C(2)H-C(1)N`), the β-carbon is C3.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the C3 of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The attack and subsequent protonation (from H₂O) yield the following structure:\n        `NC–CH₂–CH(CH₃)–CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (the nitrile, –CN).\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   C1: –CN\n        *   C2: –CH₂–\n        *   C3: –CH– with a **methyl** substituent.\n        *   C4: –CH– with a **nitro** substituent.\n        *   C5: –CH₂–\n        *   C6: –CH₃\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nThe correct combination of products is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
