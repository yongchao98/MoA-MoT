    "This problem requires us to identify which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating an undesirable compound produced by the gene's product. The most effective way to ensure a protein is non-functional is to introduce a mutation that causes a major disruption in its structure, such as truncating it very early in its sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Analysis:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   ...and so on.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\nThis is the sequence of the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**2. Mutant Analysis:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein has one amino acid changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this *could* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. Translation will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe) instead of a full-length protein. This truncated product will be non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   **Comparison:** This sequence has multiple changes compared to the intact gene.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr). Missense mutation.\n        *   Codon 6: `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). Missense mutation.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein will have several amino acids changed. This makes it more likely to be non-functional than Mutant 1, but it's still possible it could retain some function. It is less certain to cause inactivation than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   **Comparison:** When aligned with the intact gene, we see a substitution and a deletion.\n        *   Intact:   ...`CTC GCT GGT ACT`...\n        *   Mutant 4: ...`TAC GCT --- ACT`...\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr). Missense mutation.\n        *   Codon 5 (`GGT`) is deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine).\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another one changed. This is a significant alteration, but like missense mutations, it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the potential outcomes, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most catastrophic for the protein's synthesis. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. The other mutations alter the protein but carry a higher chance of leaving it partially or even fully functional. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the one most probably that will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This question asks us to identify which mutation is most likely to inactivate a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. A gene is inactivated most effectively when the protein it codes for is not produced or is severely truncated and non-functional. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation on the protein sequence.\n\nThe process of protein synthesis starts with transcription (DNA to mRNA) and then translation (mRNA to protein). During translation, the mRNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Translation begins at the start codon (`ATG` in the DNA, which becomes `AUG` in mRNA) and ends at a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA` in the DNA).\n\nTo solve this, we will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Analysis:**\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\nThis is the functional protein that we want to inactivate.\n\n**2. Mutant Analysis:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** as `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation** because it changes the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein has one amino acid changed. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). (Silent mutation).\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. `TAA` is a stop codon.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon. Protein synthesis will terminate after only two amino acids have been joined. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe) instead of the full-length protein. This truncated product will be non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`, and the sixth codon `ACT` becomes `GTC`.\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). (Missense mutation).\n        *   ...\n        *   `GTC` -> Valine (Val). (Another missense mutation, changing Threonine to Valine).\n    *   **Effect:** The protein has two amino acid substitutions. While this increases the chance of disrupting function compared to a single substitution, it is still less certain than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Comparing to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see the third codon `CTC` is changed to `TAC`, and the fifth codon `GGT` is deleted entirely.\n    *   **Effect:** This mutation involves a missense mutation (Leucine to Tyrosine) and an **in-frame deletion** (the removal of the Glycine codon). Because a full codon (3 bases) is removed, the reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid and have another one changed. This is a significant alteration, but it does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene's sequence. This will halt protein synthesis, resulting in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most definitive way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the given options.
