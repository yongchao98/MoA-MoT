    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find the expectation value of the spin operator in the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`, for an electron in a given spin state.\n\n**2. Define the State Vector and Operator**\n\n*   **State Vector (ket):** The electron's spin state is given as `(3i, 4)`. In quantum mechanics, this is represented by a column vector, which we call a \"ket\" `|ψ>`.\n    `|ψ> = [[3i], [4]]`\n\n*   **Spin Operator (S_y):** The spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli Y-matrix `σ_y` by the formula `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    The problem provides the Pauli Y-matrix:\n    `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    Therefore, the spin operator is:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n**3. The Formula for Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a quantum state `|ψ>` is calculated using the following formula:\n`<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\nwhere `<ψ|` is the \"bra\" vector, which is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" vector `|ψ>`.\n\n**4.

It's a measure of the \"length\" squared of the state vector.\n    `<ψ|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [[3i], [4]]`\n    `<ψ|ψ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n    `<ψ|ψ> = -9i² + 16`\n    Since `i² = -1`, we have:\n    `<ψ|ψ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Calculate the Numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`**\n    This is the main part of the calculation. We can pull the constant `(ħ/2)` out to simplify the matrix multiplication.\n    `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = <ψ| (ħ/2) * σ_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) * <ψ|σ_y|ψ>`\n    First, let's calculate the product `σ_y|ψ>`:\n    `σ_y|ψ> = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[3i], [4]]`\n    `σ_y|ψ> = [[(0)(3i) + (-i)(4)], [(i)(3i) + (0)(4)]]`\n    `σ_y|ψ> = [[-4i], [3i²]]`\n    `σ_y|ψ> = [[-4i], [-3]]`\n    Now, we pre-multiply this result by the bra vector `<ψ|`:\n    `<ψ|σ_y|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [[-4i], [-3]]`\n    `<ψ|σ_y|ψ> = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)`\n    `<ψ|σ_y|ψ> = 12i² - 12`\n    `<ψ|σ_y|ψ> = -12 - 12 = -24`\n    Finally, we reintroduce the `(ħ/2)` factor:\n    `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ`\n\n*   **Step 4.4: Assemble the Final Expectation Value**\n    Now we divide the result from Step 4.3 by the result from Step 4.2:\n    `<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n    `<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\n**5.
