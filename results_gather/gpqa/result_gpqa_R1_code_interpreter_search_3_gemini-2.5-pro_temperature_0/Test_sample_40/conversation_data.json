    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   Let **S'** be the rest frame of the glass. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light in the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. By definition, `n = c / u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum and `u'` is the speed of light in the medium (the glass).\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, as measured in its own rest frame (S'), is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The problem asks for the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this speed `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   To find the velocity `u` in frame S, we need to add the velocity of the glass (`v`) and the velocity of light within the glass (`u'`).
