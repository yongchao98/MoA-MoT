    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nWhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, and N = number of nitrogens.\n\nFor C9H11NO2:\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\nDoU = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong intensity bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide would typically have bands at slightly different positions.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is typical for an ester, and its conjugation with the benzene ring would shift it to a slightly lower frequency like this. An amide C=O would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (n=2, so 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (-CH3-), according to the n+1 rule (n=3, so 3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a methylene group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm, we can confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3) which is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** A broad singlet is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH group. Given the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is characteristic of aromatic protons. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which fits a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, causing the two sets of equivalent protons to split each other. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   B) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ester, ethoxy group, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with donating and withdrawing groups.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (C=O), not the ester oxygen. The -CH2- group would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data (two N-H bands) and NMR data (no formyl proton signal ~8.2 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Let's break down the evidence step-by-step to deduce the structure of the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nFor C9H11NO2:\n*   C = 9 (carbons)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogens)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n**DoU = 5**\n\nA DoU of 4 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring.

The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield because they are ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing ester group. The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield because they are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n1.
