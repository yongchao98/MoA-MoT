    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, $[CaY^{2-}]_{initial} = 0.02$ M.\n    *   The formation constant for the complex, $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    *   The problem states to assume an \"ideal pH\". This is a key simplification, which implies that the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) so that nearly all uncomplexed EDTA exists in its fully deprotonated form, $Y^{4-}$. Therefore, we can use the given formation constant directly without needing to calculate a conditional constant.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):** Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions formed at equilibrium. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| --------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium constant expression:** The formation constant, $K_f$, is defined for the formation reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$):\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n5.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the expression:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The formation constant ($5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large, which means the equilibrium lies far to the left (favoring the complex). This implies that the dissociation is minimal, and 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n7.  **Solve for x:** Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n\n    Now, perform the calculation. It is often easier to work with scientific notation.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n    $x = 2 \\times \\sqrt{10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\nTo confirm with a precise calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 + (1/K_f)*x - initial_complex_conc/K_f = 0\n# Or more simply, use the approximation x = sqrt(initial_complex_conc / K_f)\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n```output\n6.32e-07\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem describes a solution of the calcium-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The formation of the complex is highly favorable, as indicated by the large formation constant ($K_f$). The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Define the Formation Constant ($K_f$):** The equilibrium expression for this formation reaction is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    We are given $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, and we want to find how much of it dissociates to find the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ at equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation: $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| --------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    *Note: The problem states an \"ideal pH\". This is a key simplification. It means the pH is high enough (typically >10) that almost all free EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, $Y^{4-}$. This allows us to use the given $K_f$ directly without adjusting for pH effects (i.e., without calculating a conditional formation constant).*\n\n4.  **Substitute Equilibrium Concentrations into the $K_f$ Expression:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply an Approximation:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large. This means the equilibrium lies heavily to the right (favoring the complex), and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be a very small value compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying approximation that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** The equation now becomes much simpler:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, take the square root to find x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Verify the Approximation:** We assumed $x \\ll 0.02$. Our calculated value is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$, which is indeed much, much smaller than 0.02. The approximation is valid.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M matches option A.\n\nTo ensure the calculation is precise, we can use a simple script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_concentration = 0.02\n\n# From the approximation K_f = initial_complex_concentration / x^2\n# We solve for x, where x = [Ca2+]\nx_squared = initial_complex_concentration / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n```output\nThe concentration of Ca2+ ions is: 6.32e-07 M\n```\nThe calculation confirms the result.\n\n<<<A>>>",
