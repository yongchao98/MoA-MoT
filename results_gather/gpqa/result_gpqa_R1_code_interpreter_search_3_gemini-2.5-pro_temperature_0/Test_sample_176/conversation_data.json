The formula is:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{emit} = b / T$\n        where b is Wien's constant.

We need to find the *emitted* wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Now, we rearrange this to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Since $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation from step 3:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\n8.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    We need to plug in the values for $v_{r2}$ and $c$.\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s = $700,000$ m/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) = $299,792,458$ m/s\n    The calculation is best done with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values and constants\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1/R2\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# From the Doppler shift and Wien's Law, we derived the temperature ratio:\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\nT_ratio = 1 / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229200280092933\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.2292. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars was not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.32\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
