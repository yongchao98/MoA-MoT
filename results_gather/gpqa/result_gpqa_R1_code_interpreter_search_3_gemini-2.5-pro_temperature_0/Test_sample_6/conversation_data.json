    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** The question describes the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Interpret the question:** The question asks for the energy at which the gamma-ray lifetimes are \"limited\" by this process. This implies we are looking for the energy at which this interaction is most significant, meaning the probability of the interaction (the cross-section) is at its maximum. This is different from the threshold energy, which is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur at all.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** The probability of the interaction depends on the center-of-mass energy of the two colliding photons. The square of the center-of-mass energy, denoted as $s$, is a Lorentz invariant quantity. For a collision between a high-energy photon of energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and a low-energy photon of energy $E_{CMB}$ at an angle $\\theta$, the invariant mass squared is given by:\n    $s = 2 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n4.  **Maximize the Interaction:** The interaction is most efficient for head-on collisions, where the angle between the two photons is $\\theta = \\pi$ (or 180 degrees). In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and the expression for $s$ simplifies to:\n    $s = 2 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} (1 - (-1)) = 4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}$\n\n5.  **Energy of Peak Cross-Section:** The cross-section for the process $\\gamma\\gamma \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is not constant but depends on the center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$. It is known from quantum electrodynamics that this cross-section has a peak value when the center-of-mass energy is approximately $\\sqrt{s_{peak}} \\approx 1.25$ MeV. This is the energy at which the interaction is most likely to occur, and thus where the gamma-ray lifetime is most severely limited.\n\n6.  **Set up the equation:** We can now find the energy of the incoming gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma}$, that corresponds to this peak cross-section. We set the center-of-mass energy for a head-on collision equal to the peak energy:\n    $4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} = s_{peak} = (\\sqrt{s_{peak}})^2 = (1.25 \\text{ MeV})^2$\n\n7.  **Solve for E_gamma:** We can now solve for $E_{\\gamma}$:\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(1.25 \\text{ MeV})^2}{4 E_{CMB}}$\n\n8.  **Plug in the values:** The problem provides the necessary values:\n    *   Peak cross-section energy: $\\sqrt{s_{peak}} = 1.25 \\text{ MeV} = 1.25 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n    *   Average CMB photon energy: $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    Now, we perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nsqrt_s_peak_MeV = 1.25  # Center-of-mass energy for peak cross-section in MeV\nE_CMB_eV = 1e-3         # Average CMB photon energy in eV\n\n# Convert peak energy to eV\nsqrt_s_peak_eV = sqrt_s_peak_MeV * 1e6\n\n# Calculate the square of the peak energy\ns_peak_eV2 = sqrt_s_peak_eV**2\n\n# Calculate the gamma-ray energy in eV using the formula for a head-on collision\n# E_gamma = s_peak / (4 * E_CMB)\nE_gamma_eV = s_peak_eV2 / (4 * E_CMB_eV)\n\n# Convert the gamma-ray energy to GeV (1 GeV = 1e9 eV)\nE_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / 1e9\n\nprint(f\"The gamma-ray energy is {E_gamma_GeV:.2e} GeV\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to {E_gamma_GeV/1e5:.1f}*1e5 GeV\")\n```\n\n9.  **Final Answer:** The calculation shows that the gamma-ray energy at which the interaction cross-section is maximum is approximately $3.91 \\times 10^5$ GeV. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n*(Self-reflection: An alternative interpretation is to calculate the threshold energy for the reaction, which is $E_{\\gamma, th} = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_{CMB} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV (Option C). However, the phrase \"lifetimes... limited\" points towards the energy of maximum effect, not the minimum energy for the effect to begin. The fact that the peak cross-section calculation precisely matches option D makes it the most likely intended answer.)*\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem asks for the energy of a gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$) that would have its lifetime significantly limited by pair production with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon. The reaction is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. A \"limited lifetime\" implies that the interaction probability, or cross-section, is high. The cross-section for this process is not constant; it has a threshold energy below which it is zero, and it reaches a peak value at a specific center-of-mass energy before decreasing again. The energy at which the lifetime is most limited corresponds to the energy that maximizes this cross-section.\n\n1.  **Relativistic Kinematics:**\n    The interaction is governed by the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame, which is a Lorentz invariant quantity. The square of the CM energy, $s$, for a collision between a high-energy photon of energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and a CMB photon of energy $E_{CMB}$ is given by:\n    $s = 2 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n\n2.  **Maximizing the Interaction:**\n    The interaction is most efficient for a head-on collision, where $\\theta = \\pi$ (180 degrees).
