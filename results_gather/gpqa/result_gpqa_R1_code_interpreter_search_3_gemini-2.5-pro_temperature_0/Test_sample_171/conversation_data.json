The relationship between the population of different energy levels and temperature is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (`N`) in two different energy states, say state `i` and state `j`, as:\n    `N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   `E_i` and `E_j` are the energies of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\".
