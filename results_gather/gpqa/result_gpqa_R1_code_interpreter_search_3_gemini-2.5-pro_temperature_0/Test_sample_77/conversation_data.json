    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electric and magnetic fields, and thus the scalar and vector potentials, do not respond instantaneously to changes in the source charge and current distributions. Instead, the information propagates outward from the source at the speed of light, c. This means that the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly $t - t_r$.\nLet $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the position of the charge q at the retarded time $t_r$.\nThe distance the signal travels is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\nSo, the time delay is $\\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\nThis gives the relation:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nUsing the notation given in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition becomes: $t - t_r = d/c$, or $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials from time-dependent charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation of the integral (often done by changing the integration variable to the retarded time) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe result of this integration is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe term in the square brackets must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The factor $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$ in the denominator accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to the charge's motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\n### 3. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the derived potentials to match the format of the given options.\nThe denominator is:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow substitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(\\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(\\frac{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option C.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) and B) are incorrect as they represent quasi-static approximations or are dimensionally inconsistent, and they do not account for retardation correctly.\n*   D) has the wrong sign in the denominator. The sign must be negative, corresponding to the term $-\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$. A positive sign would correspond to an \"advanced\" potential, which is unphysical.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Retarded Time:** The fundamental principle is that electromagnetic interactions propagate at the speed of light, $c$. Therefore, the potential at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is determined not by the charge's current position and velocity, but by its position and velocity at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the **retarded time**. The signal emitted by the charge at time $t_r$ from position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ must travel a distance $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. This gives the implicit relation for $t_r$:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n2.  **Problem Notation:** Let's match the standard variables with the notation given in the problem:\n    *   The charge's position at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The distance is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Retarded Potentials:** The general solutions for the potentials from time-varying sources are the retarded potentials, given by integrals over the source distributions evaluated at the retarded time. For a point charge $q$ with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density is $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$ and the current density is $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t')\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\n4.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** Evaluating the retarded potential integrals for a point charge is a standard but non-trivial calculation in electrodynamics. The result is the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key feature is a denominator term that accounts for the \"piling up\" or \"spreading out\" of the influence of the charge due to its motion relative to the observer (a relativistic Doppler effect).\n\n    The standard forms of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n    where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observer, and all quantities in the brackets ($d$, $\\hat{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options:** Let's manipulate the denominator to match the form given in the options:\n    $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Now, let's rewrite the potentials using this form of the denominator:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n    To match the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** These expressions exactly match option C.\n    *   Option A is the quasi-static approximation, which ignores the retardation effect in the denominator.\n    *   Option B is dimensionally incorrect for the vector potential.\n    *   Option D has the wrong sign in the denominator ($+$ instead of $-$). The negative sign is crucial and arises from the physics of retardation; a positive sign would correspond to unphysical \"advanced\" potentials.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>",
