    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will attach.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho, Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct incoming groups primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low for these substances.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho, Para-directing groups:** Halogens are an exception. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive electron withdrawal but are ortho, para-directing due to electron donation via resonance.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Step 2: Separate substances into low and high para-yield groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two main groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** 2, 4, 6\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho, para-directors):** 1, 3, 5\n\nThe final order will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\nOrder: (2, 4, 6) < (1, 3, 5)\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within the low para-yield group (meta-directors)**\n\nThe substances are 4(-NO2), 6(-COOH), and 2(-COOC2H5). For these meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is the strongest deactivator, and the ester group is the weakest among the three).\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of the deactivating strength:\n-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5\n\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the high para-yield group (ortho, para-directors)**\n\nThe substances are 1(-CH3), 5(-C2H5), and 3(-Cl). For these o,p-directors, both ortho and para products are formed, but the para-isomer is often favored to avoid steric hindrance between the existing substituent and the large incoming bromine atom.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulkiness provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which favors the formation of the para-isomer. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-product than toluene.\n    *   Yield of para-isomer: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating but strongly directs to the para position. In the bromination of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is the major product by a large margin (typically around 89%), which is a higher percentage than for either toluene or ethylbenzene. The combination of electronic effects and sterics strongly favors the para position.\n    *   Yield of para-isomer: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the ordered groups**\n\nNow, we combine the order of the two groups:\n(Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final combined order is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents based on their directing effects.**\n\nFirst, we need to understand how each substituent on the benzene ring affects where the incoming bromine atom will attach. Substituents are classified as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves. For these substances, the ortho and para isomers are formed in very small amounts.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances that are meta-directors will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer and will appear first in the list. The ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields and will appear last.\n\nThe overall order will look like: (Meta-directors in order) < (Ortho, para-directors in order).\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2).**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group will more strongly direct to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of the -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 groups.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a strong deactivating group.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is deactivating, but generally considered less deactivating than -COOH.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of this deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\n\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This ratio is heavily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1, -CH3) and Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk provides more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of para-yield is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, they are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For example, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields approximately 89% of the para-isomer. This percentage is typically higher than that for toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene. The electronic effects of the halogen's lone pairs strongly favor the para position.\n\nCombining these facts, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\nSo, the order is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups.**\n\nNow we combine the ordered groups to get the final sequence:\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring. The substituent already present on the ring (e.g., -CH3, -NO2) determines two things:\n1.  **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster or slower than benzene itself.\n2.  **Orientation:** Where the incoming bromine atom (the electrophile, Br+) will attach.

The substances with ortho, para-directing groups will have higher yields and will come last.\n\nThe overall order will be: **(4, 6, 2) < (1, 5, 3)**\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nThese groups are all deactivating, meaning they pull electron density from the ring and direct incoming groups to the meta position. The stronger the deactivating effect, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and consequently, the lower the yield of the minor para-isomer.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   -NO2 (nitro group) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   -COOH (carboxylic acid group) is a strong deactivating group.\n*   -COOC2H5 (ester group) is also deactivating, but slightly weaker than -COOH.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the *reverse* order of this deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\n\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, both ortho and para products are formed. The ratio between them is primarily determined by **steric hindrance**.

This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions more effectively in ethylbenzene than in toluene. As a result, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-product.\n    *   Therefore, the order of para-yield is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is a deactivating group, it is known to be strongly para-directing in electrophilic substitutions. The combination of its electronic and steric properties results in a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically ~87-90% for bromination), which is significantly higher than for either toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the para-yield for chlorobenzene is the highest in this group.\n\nCombining these facts, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Ordered Groups**\n\nNow, we combine the order of the two groups to get the final sequence:\n(Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
