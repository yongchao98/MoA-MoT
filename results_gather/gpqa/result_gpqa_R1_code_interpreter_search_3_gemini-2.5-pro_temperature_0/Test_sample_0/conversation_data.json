    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), this relationship is expressed as:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n*   **Applying the Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   The lifetime of a quantum state (τ) can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt).\n    *   Therefore, the uncertainty in the energy of a state (also known as the natural linewidth) is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    *   To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E2 - E1|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2). This ensures that the energy distributions (linewidths) of the two states do not significantly overlap.\n    *   The condition for resolvability is: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n\n*   **Calculating the Energy Uncertainties:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s.\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   For the first state (State 1):\n        *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For the second state (State 2):\n        *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n*   **Determining the Minimum Energy Difference:**\n    *   The total uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties: ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels, |E2 - E1|, must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV to be clearly resolved.\n\n*   **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n\nThe only energy difference large enough to ensure the two levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n**2.
