    "This problem involves determining the energy states of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since the particles are spin-1/2, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the quantized energy levels are given by:\n`E_n = n^2 * (h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)`\nwhere `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit `E` as:\n`E = pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2 * m * L^2)`\nSince `hbar = h / (2 * pi)`, we can rewrite `E` as `E = (pi^2 * (h / (2 * pi))^2) / (2 * m * L^2) = (h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)`.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed in terms of `E`:\n`E_n = n^2 * E`\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**3. Calculating the System Energies**\n\nWe need to find the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state by filling the single-particle energy levels with the four fermions according to the rules.\n\n**Ground State (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n*   **n = 1:** We place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed by these particles is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   **n = 2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed by these particles is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**First Excited State (E_1st_excited)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available energy level, which requires the minimum amount of energy. The ground state has the `n=1` and `n=2` levels filled. The lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`. The least energetic promotion is to move a particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    `E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n    `E_1st_excited = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E)`\n    `E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**Second Excited State (E_2nd_excited)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider different possible promotions from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is the ground state (10E), the next lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the next lowest after that is the second excited state (18E).\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state, first excited state,\n    and second excited state for four spin-1/2 particles in a 1D\n    infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Single particle energy E_n = n^2 * E\n    def E_n(n):\n        return n**2\n\n    # Ground State: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2\n    E_ground = 2 * E_n(1) + 2 * E_n(2)\n\n    # First Excited State: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3\n    # Config: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3\n    E_1st_excited = 2 * E_n(1) + 1 * E_n(2) + 1 * E_n(3)\n\n    # Second Excited State: Find the next lowest energy configuration.\n    # We need to compare different possibilities.\n    \n    # Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3\n    # Config: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3\n    E_excited_A = 1 * E_n(1) + 2 * E_n(2) + 1 * E_n(3)\n\n    # Possibility B: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3\n    # Config: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3\n    E_excited_B = 2 * E_n(1) + 2 * E_n(3)\n\n    # Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4\n    # Config: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4\n    E_excited_C = 2 * E_n(1) + 1 * E_n(2) + 1 * E_n(4)\n\n    # The second excited state is the minimum of these possibilities that is\n    # greater than the first excited state.\n    possible_energies = [E_excited_A, E_excited_B, E_excited_C]\n    E_2nd_excited = min(possible_energies)\n\n    print(f\"Ground State Energy: {E_ground}E\")\n    print(f\"First Excited State Energy: {E_1st_excited}E\")\n    print(f\"Second Excited State Energy: {E_2nd_excited}E\")\n    print(f\"The three energies are: {E_ground}E, {E_1st_excited}E, {E_2nd_excited}E\")\n\ncalculate_energies()\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",

    "This problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well for its ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle of mass `m` in a 1D infinite potential well of length `L` are given by:\n`E_n = n^2 * (h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)`\nwhere `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem provides a base energy unit `E`:\n`E = pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2 * m * L^2)`\n\nWe can show that these two expressions are related. Since `hbar = h / (2 * pi)`, we have `hbar^2 = h^2 / (4 * pi^2)`. Substituting this into the expression for `E`:\n`E = pi^2 * (h^2 / (4 * pi^2)) / (2 * m * L^2) = (h^2 / 4) / (2 * m * L^2) = h^2 / (8 * m * L^2)`\nThis is the energy of the `n=1` state.\n\nTherefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of `E`:\n`E_n = n^2 * E`\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions.

Their contribution is `2 * 4E = 8E`.\n    -   **Total Ground State Energy:** `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n*   **First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy)**\n    To get the first excited state, we make the lowest-energy promotion from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    -   The configuration becomes: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n    -   **Total First Excited State Energy:** `E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n*   **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy)**\n    We need to find the next possible energy configuration above the first excited state. Let's consider the possible promotions from the ground state:\n    1.  **Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3:**\n        -   Configuration: 1 particle in `n=1`, 2 in `n=2`, 1 in `n=3`.\n        -   Energy: `(1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    2.  **Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3:**\n        -   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 in `n=3`.\n        -   Energy: `(2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    3.  **Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4:**\n        -   Configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 in `n=2`, 1 in `n=4`.\n        -   Energy: `(2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\n    The lowest energy state is the ground state (10E). The next lowest is the first excited state (15E). The next lowest after that is 18E, which is the second excited state.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
