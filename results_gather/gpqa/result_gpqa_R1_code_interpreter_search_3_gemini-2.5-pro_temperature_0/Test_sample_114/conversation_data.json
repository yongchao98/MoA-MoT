    "This is a classic relativistic collision problem that can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Process:**\n    *   The system consists of an electron and a positron before the collision, and two photons after the collision.\n    *   The process is annihilation: `e- + e+ -> γ + γ`.\n    *   This is a relativistic process because the Lorentz factors are greater than 1.\n\n2.  **Define the Initial State (Before Collision):**\n    *   We need the energy and momentum of the electron and the positron. Let the rest mass of both be `m_e` and the speed of light be `c`. The rest energy is `m_e * c^2`.\n    *   **Electron (e-)**:\n        *   Moves along the +x axis.\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n        *   Energy `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c^2 = 4 * m_e * c^2`.\n        *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_e*c^2)^2`.\n        *   Momentum `p_e*c = sqrt(E_e^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt((4*m_e*c^2)^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt(16-1) * m_e*c^2 = sqrt(15) * m_e*c^2`.\n        *   So, the momentum is `p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e*c`. The momentum vector is `p_e_vec = (+sqrt(15) * m_e*c, 0)`.\n    *   **Positron (e+)**:\n        *   Moves along the -x axis.\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n        *   Energy `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c^2 = 2 * m_e * c^2`.\n        *   Momentum `p_p*c = sqrt(E_p^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt((2*m_e*c^2)^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt(4-1) * m_e*c^2 = sqrt(3) * m_e*c^2`.\n        *   So, the momentum is `p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e*c`. The momentum vector is `p_p_vec = (-sqrt(3) * m_e*c, 0)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   **Total Energy `E_initial`**:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4*m_e*c^2 + 2*m_e*c^2 = 6*m_e*c^2`.\n    *   **Total Momentum `P_initial`**:\n        `P_initial = p_e_vec + p_p_vec = ((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c, 0)`.\n\n4.  **Define the Final State (After Collision):**\n    *   The final state consists of two photons (γ1 and γ2).\n    *   Photons are massless, so their energy-momentum relation is `E = p*c`.\n    *   The problem states they have the same energy: `E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ`.\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". Let's assume the collision happens in the x-y plane. Let the angle of the first photon with the +x axis be `θ`, and the second be `-φ`.\n    *   Momentum of photon 1: `p_γ1_vec = (p_γ * cos(θ), p_γ * sin(θ))`. Since `p_γ = E_γ/c`, this is `( (E_γ/c)*cos(θ), (E_γ/c)*sin(θ) )`.\n    *   Momentum of photon 2: `p_γ2_vec = (p_γ * cos(-φ), p_γ * sin(-φ)) = ( (E_γ/c)*cos(φ), -(E_γ/c)*sin(φ) )`.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Energy Conservation (`E_initial = E_final`)**:\n        `6*m_e*c^2 = E_γ1 + E_γ2 = 2*E_γ`.\n        This gives the energy of each photon: `E_γ = 3*m_e*c^2`.\n    *   **Momentum Conservation (`P_initial = P_final`)**:\n        We equate the components of the initial and final momentum vectors.\n        *   **y-component**:\n            `0 = (E_γ/c)*sin(θ) - (E_γ/c)*sin(φ)`.\n            This implies `sin(θ) = sin(φ)`. Since the photons go in different directions (upper and lower), we must have `θ = φ`.

Identify the Physical Principles\nThe problem describes the annihilation of an electron and a positron, which is a process governed by the principles of **conservation of relativistic energy** and **conservation of momentum**.\n\n### 2. Define the Initial State (Before Annihilation)\nLet `m_e` be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron, and `c` be the speed of light. The rest energy of each particle is `E_0 = m_e c^2`. We will define the horizontal axis as the x-axis.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Moves from the left, so its velocity is in the **+x direction**.\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Relativistic energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2`.\n    *   Relativistic momentum is found using the energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2`.\n    *   `(p_e c)^2 = E_e^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = (4 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 15 (m_e c^2)^2`.\n    *   The magnitude of the electron's momentum is `p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e c`.\n    *   The momentum vector is `P_e = (+sqrt(15) m_e c, 0)`.\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Moves from the right, so its velocity is in the **-x direction**.\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Relativistic energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2`.\n    *   `(p_p c)^2 = E_p^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 3 (m_e c^2)^2`.\n    *   The magnitude of the positron's momentum is `p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e c`.\n    *   The momentum vector is `P_p = (-sqrt(3) m_e c, 0)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum\n*   **Total Initial Energy `E_initial`:**\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2`.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum `P_initial`:**\n    `P_initial = P_e + P_p = (sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c, 0) = ((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c, 0)`.\n\n### 4. Define the Final State (After Annihilation) and Apply Conservation Laws\nThe final state consists of two photons. The problem states they have equal energies.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:**\n    *   The total final energy is `E_final = E_γ1 + E_γ2`. Since `E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ`, we have `E_final = 2 E_γ`.\n    *   Applying conservation: `E_initial = E_final` => `6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_γ`.\n    *   This gives the energy of each photon: `E_γ = 3 m_e c^2`.\n    *   The magnitude of the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 m_e c`.\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:**\n    *   The photons move \"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\". This implies their motion is symmetric about the x-axis. Let `θ` be the angle of each photon's path with respect to the positive x-axis. The total angle between them is `2θ`.\n    *   The initial momentum has no y-component. The final y-momentum is `p_γ sin(θ) - p_γ sin(θ) = 0`, which is consistent.\n    *   Now, we conserve momentum in the x-direction:\n        `P_initial_x = P_final_x`\n        `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2 p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n### 5. Solve for the Angle\nSubstitute the value of `p_γ = 3 m_e c` into the momentum conservation equation:\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c = 6 m_e c * cos(θ)`\n\nCancel the common term `m_e c` from both sides:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n### 6. Calculate the Numerical Value\nWe will now use a short script to calculate the final angle `2θ`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta), where theta is the angle of one photon with the horizontal axis.\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function.\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta from radians to degrees.\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The question asks for the angle between the directions of the two photons, which is 2 * theta.\ntotal_angle_deg = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(total_angle_deg)\n```\nThe calculation yields a total angle of approximately 138.18 degrees. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 138\nB) 172\nC) 96\nD) 74\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
