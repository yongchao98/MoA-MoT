    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This notation tells us:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    We are performing a measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:**\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is given in the *coupled basis* $\\{|l, m>\\}$. The measurement outcome is described in the *uncoupled basis* $\\{|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>\\}$.\n    To find the probability, we need to express the initial state in the uncoupled basis. The probability of measuring a specific outcome $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of the corresponding basis ket $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$ in this expansion.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    This translates to the quantum numbers as:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n5.  **Analyze the Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   For the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's calculate the total magnetic quantum number for the desired outcome: $m_{outcome} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    The initial state has a definite total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m = -1$. The desired final state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m_{outcome} = -2$.\n    Since $m \\neq m_{outcome}$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), it is impossible for the system in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ to be found in a state with $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n\n7.  **Formal Justification with Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    The expansion of the coupled state into the uncoupled basis is given by:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m> |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$\n    The terms $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. A key property of these coefficients is that they are zero unless the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied.\n\n    We want to find the probability of measuring $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$. This probability is:\n    $P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n    The term inside the modulus is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for $l_1=1, l_2=1, l=2, m=-1, m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1$.\n    We check the selection rule: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m = -1$, the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met.\n    Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero: $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    The probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** Two electrons.\n    *   **State Property:** They are in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   **Initial State:** The combined 2-electron system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n        *   $l_1=1$: orbital angular momentum of electron 1.\n        *   $l_2=1$: orbital angular momentum of electron 2.\n        *   $l=2$: total orbital angular momentum of the system.\n        *   $m=-1$: z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. The eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   **Measurement:** We measure the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of getting:\n        *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n        *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Physics Principle:**\n    The core of this problem lies in the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m>$) and the uncoupled basis ($|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$). A fundamental principle when adding angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component.\n    The total z-component of angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components.\n    In terms of operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    In terms of their corresponding quantum numbers: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle to the Given Values:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we know the quantum number for the total z-component is $m = -1$.\n    *   The measurement outcome we are interested in has individual quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's calculate the total z-component quantum number for this specific outcome: $m_{outcome} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   The initial state has a definite total z-component quantum number of $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final state has a total z-component quantum number of $m_{outcome} = -2$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_{outcome}$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum is violated.\n    *   This means that it is impossible to find the system in this final state if it started in the given initial state. The amplitude for this transition is zero.\n\n5.  **Formalizing with Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    The probability of measuring the state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$ when the system is in the state $|l, m>$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>|^2$\n    A key property (the selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero *only if* $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    In our case, we want to calculate:\n    $P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n    Since $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$ and $m = -1$, the condition is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Computational Verification (Optional but good for confirmation):**\n    We can use a computational tool to calculate the specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficient to be certain.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is written as <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>\n# The arguments for the sympy CG function are (l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m)\n\n# Quantum numbers from the problem:\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome:\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# Calculate the coefficient\ncg_coefficient = CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the coefficient's absolute value\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: {cg_coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The joint probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n\nThe code confirms that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this combination of quantum numbers is zero, and therefore the probability is also zero.\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum ($L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$) when the system is in a given coupled angular momentum state.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ confirm the electrons are in p-orbitals.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the **total** orbital angular momentum.

This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle when adding angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This relationship holds for their quantum numbers as well:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n    This rule acts as a selection rule. For a coupled state with a specific $m$ to have a non-zero component in an uncoupled state with specific $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$, this equation must be satisfied.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Now, we compare the total $m$ value of the initial state with the sum required by the final state:\n    Is $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$?\n    Is $-1 = -2$?\n\n    No, the equality does not hold.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the z-component of the total angular momentum is not conserved between the initial state ($m=-1$) and the desired final state ($m_{l1}+m_{l2}=-2$), it is impossible to obtain this measurement result.
