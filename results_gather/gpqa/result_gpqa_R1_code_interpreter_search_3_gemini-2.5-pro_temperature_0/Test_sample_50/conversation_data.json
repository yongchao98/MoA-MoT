    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n*   We have a point charge `q`.\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   The charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (where `d > R`).\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\nThis problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The core idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. The electric field *outside* the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and this image charge.\n\nThe properties of the image charge (`q'`) and its position (`d'`) are chosen precisely so that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, satisfying the condition of a grounded sphere.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge is:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** `d'` = `R^2 / d` (measured from the center of the sphere, on the line connecting the center and `q`).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n`U = W_ext = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext ⋅ dr`\n\nThe external force `F_ext` is equal and opposite to the electric force `F_electric` exerted on the charge `q` by the sphere.\n`F_ext = -F_electric`\nSo, `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_electric ⋅ dr`\n\nThe electric force on `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nLet's calculate the force on charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center.\n*   Position of `q`: `x`\n*   Position of image charge `q'`: `x' = R^2 / x`\n*   Magnitude of image charge `q'`: `-q * (R/x)`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `x - x' = x - R^2/x`\n\nThe force on `q` is the Coulomb force from `q'`:\n`F_electric(x) = k * q * q' / (distance)^2`\n`F_electric(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_electric(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F_electric(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n`F_electric(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThis is an attractive force (negative sign), as expected.\n\nNow, we integrate to find the potential energy:\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F_electric(x) dx`\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use a u-substitution:\n*   Let `u = x^2 - R^2`\n*   Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`\n\nThe integral becomes:\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫ u^-2 du`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-u^-1]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R / 2) * (1/u)`\n\nSubstitute back `u = x^2 - R^2`:\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate this from the starting point (`x = ∞`) to the final position (`x = d`):\n`U = [ - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) ] - [ - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (∞^2 - R^2)) ]`\nThe second term goes to zero because of the infinity in the denominator.\n\nSo, the final potential energy is:\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n### 4. Alternative Method (Interaction Energy)\nA quicker, but more subtle, method relies on the concept of interaction energy. The potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of a conductor (where charge is induced) is `(1/2)` of the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of `1/2` arises because the induced charge is not fixed but is created by the presence of `q`.\n\n*   Interaction energy of `q` and `q'`: `U_int = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n*   `U_int = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n*   `U_int = - (k * q^2 * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n*   `U_int = - k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` (This matches option C, a common mistake)\n\nThe actual potential energy of the system is half of this:\n*   `U_system = (1/2) * U_int`\n*   `U_system = (1/2) * [ - k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n*   `U_system = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere, due to the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'`.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nFor a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the induced charge distribution on the sphere can be replaced by a single image charge `q'` located inside the sphere.\n\n*   **Position of the image charge (`d'`):** The image charge is located along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`, at a distance `d' = R^2 / d` from the center.\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge (`q'`):** The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n\nThis specific choice of `q'` and `d'` ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, which is the condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The force exerted by the external agent is equal and opposite to the electric force on the charge `q`.\n\n`U = W_external = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_external ⋅ dr = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_electric ⋅ dr`\n\nThe electric force `F_electric` on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nLet's consider the charge `q` at an arbitrary position `x` from the center of the sphere (where `x ≥ R`).\n*   The position of its image charge is `x' = R^2 / x`.\n*   The magnitude of its image charge is `q'(x) = -q * (R/x)`.\n*   The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and its image `q'` (at `x'`) is `x - x' = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe electric force on `q` at position `x` is:\n`F_electric(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - x')^2`\n`F_electric(x) = k * q * [-q(R/x)] / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_electric(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / [(x^2 - R^2)/x]^2`\n`F_electric(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * [x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2]`\n`F_electric(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThis is an attractive force, pulling `q` towards the sphere.\n\nNow, we integrate to find the potential energy:\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_electric(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [- k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du / 2`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = (1/2) * (-u^-1) = -1 / (2u)`\n\nSubstituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral is `-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` evaluated from `x = ∞` to `x = d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))] }`\n\nThe term with infinity in the denominator goes to zero.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
