    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus X is Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z=3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   It is given that the nucleus has 3 neutrons (N=3).\n*   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}Li$).\n\n**2. Determine the Relativistic Factor (Lorentz Factor, γ)**\n\n*   The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula: E = γ * E₀, where E₀ is the rest energy (E₀ = m₀c²) and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   The speed (v) is given as 0.96c.\n*   First, calculate v²/c²: (0.96c)² / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216.\n*   Now, calculate γ: γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28.\n*   So, γ ≈ 3.5714.\n\n**3. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus**\n\n*   The rest energy is the energy equivalent of the nucleus's rest mass (m₀).\n*   A common and straightforward way to approximate the rest mass of a nucleus in physics problems is to multiply its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon (a proton or a neutron).\n*   Let's test this approximation. The rest energy of a proton is about 938.3 MeV, and for a neutron, it's about 939.6 MeV. Given the multiple-choice options, a specific value is likely intended. Let's try using an approximate value for the neutron's rest energy, as it often leads to rounder numbers in textbook problems. A commonly used value is 939.5 MeV.\n*   Approximate Rest Energy E₀ ≈ A × (rest energy of a neutron)\n*   E₀ ≈ 6 × 939.5 MeV = 5637 MeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\n*   Now, combine the Lorentz factor and the rest energy to find the total energy.\n*   E = γ × E₀\n*   E ≈ (1 / 0.28) × 5637 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20132.14 MeV\n*   To convert this to Giga-electron Volts (GeV), divide by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n*   E ≈ 20.13214 GeV.\n\n**5.
