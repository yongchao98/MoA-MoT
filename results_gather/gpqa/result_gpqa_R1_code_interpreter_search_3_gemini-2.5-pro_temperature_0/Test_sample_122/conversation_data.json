    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation and the calculation of distance in a different reference frame.\n\n**1.

Identify the goal:**\n*   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame, `d`.\n\n**3. Reasoning:**\n*   To find the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame, we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is different from the time measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`) due to time dilation. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n*   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n**4. Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the ratio `v/c` (often called beta, `β`).**\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ`.**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`.**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, `d`.**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n\nLet's compute the final value using a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(distance_galaxy)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.1784789724\n<<<\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal**\n*   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame, `d`.\n\n**4. Apply the Principles of Special Relativity**\n*   **Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approach:** If we ignored relativity, the distance would simply be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option C, but it's incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n*   **Relativistic Approach:** Due to the high speed, we must account for time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame) is longer than the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta's frame).\n\n**5. The Time Dilation Formula**\nThe relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt'`) is given by:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**6. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, plug this into the gamma formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**7. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\nNow we can find the time elapsed as measured by an observer in the Galaxy:\n`Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**8. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d)**\nFinally, we can calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame using the velocity `v` and the dilated time `Δt`:\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we'll use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt_galaxy)\n# First, calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n# Then, calculate the dilated time\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(distance_galaxy)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.1784789724\n<<<The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.
