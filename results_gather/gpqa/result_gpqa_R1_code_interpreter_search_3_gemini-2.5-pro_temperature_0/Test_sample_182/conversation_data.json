    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Understand the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond (between C3 and C4). A ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD, and the double bond contributes another 1.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group is attached to the ring (let's say at C1). It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, attached at C2. It also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This group is attached at C5. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), contributing 1 to the IHD.\n\nLet's count the total IHD of the reactant based on its structural features:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C bond within the ring.\n*   1 for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid.\n*   1 for the C=O bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the C=C bond in the vinyl group.\n\nTotal IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant to verify this.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's draw the structure and count.\n    *   C1: -CH(COOH)- (1H)\n    *   C2: -CH(CHO)- (1H)\n    *   C3: =CH- (1H)\n    *   C4: =CH- (1H)\n    *   C5: -CH(CH=CH2)- (1H)\n    *   C6: -CH2- (2H)\n    *   -COOH (1H)\n    *   -CHO (1H)\n    *   -CH=CH2 (3H)\n    *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\nLet's calculate the IHD using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces ketones (>C=O) to methylene groups (>CH2).\n*   It reduces alcohols (-OH) to alkanes (-H).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (-C=C-) and triple bonds to single bonds (-CH-CH-).\n\nEssentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all pi bonds.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will transform the reactant as follows:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl** group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n*   The **double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a **single bond**, converting the ring to a **cyclohexane** ring.\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains intact. The reactant has a C10 skeleton (a 6-membered ring with three side chains of 1, 1, and 2 carbons). The product will also have this C10 skeleton.\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon containing a single ring. It is a substituted cyclohexane. A saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon has the general formula **CnH2n**.\nSince our product has 10 carbon atoms (C=10), its molecular formula will be **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the product (C10H20) using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD from the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   It has **one ring**.\n*   It has **zero pi bonds** (no double or triple bonds).\n\nIHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds)\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the starting material and determine its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring (which counts as 1 IHD) with one carbon-carbon double bond (which counts as another 1 IHD).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\nTo confirm, let's find the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C)**: 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H)**: A saturated C10 alkane is C10H22. The IHD of 5 means we have 5 * 2 = 10 fewer hydrogens. So, H = 22 - 10 = 12.\n*   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n*   Using the formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), we get IHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**\n\nThe reagent combination of red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. Its primary function is to perform a complete reduction of a molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\n*   It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols) to simple C-H bonds, removing the oxygen atoms entirely.\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds (saturates the molecule).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying this reduction to our reactant:\n*   The **cyclohexene** ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl** group (-CHO) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl** group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton remains the same (10 carbon atoms). The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, specifically 1-ethyl-2,4-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact IUPAC name depends on numbering, but the structure is a cyclohexane ring with these substituents). The key point is that the product is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the final product can be calculated based on its structure:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still has the six-membered ring, so there is 1 ring.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: The reaction has reduced all C=C and C=O bonds to single bonds. Therefore, there are 0 pi bonds in the product.\n\nIHD_product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula of the product. Since the product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give the same result.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Analyze the Reactant and its Structure**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.

Understand the Reaction and the Reagent**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its effect is to perform a complete reduction of the molecule to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\n*   It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids and aldehydes) to alkyl groups (e.g., -COOH and -CHO become -CH₃).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will transform the reactant as follows:\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the ring into a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The **C=O double bond** in the carboxylic acid group will be removed, and the entire group will be reduced to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**.\n*   The **C=O double bond** in the formyl group will be removed, and the group will be reduced to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**.\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting it into an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\nThe final product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**. The carbon skeleton is preserved (it still has 10 carbon atoms), but all π-bonds and oxygen atoms have been removed. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of π-bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π-bonds**: The powerful reduction has eliminated all double bonds (both C=C and C=O). So, the number of π-bonds is 0.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThis means the final product has a degree of unsaturation of 1, which is solely due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n<<<A>>>",
