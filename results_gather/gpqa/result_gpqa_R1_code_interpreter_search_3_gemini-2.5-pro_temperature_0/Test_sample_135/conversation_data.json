    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a vector field `f(r)` with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n*   In spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇.f) dV`, where the volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**3. Address the Singularity**\n\nA crucial point is that the vector field `f(r) = 1/r^2 * r_hat` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), as its magnitude goes to infinity. If we were to calculate the divergence `∇.f` directly using the formula in spherical coordinates for `r ≠ 0`, we would get:\n\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\n\nThis result (`∇.f = 0`) is valid everywhere *except* at the origin. The singularity at the origin contributes to the integral. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this by relating the volume integral to a surface integral on the boundary, where the field is well-defined (since `R > 0`).\n\n**4. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe will calculate the right-hand side of the theorem, the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n*   **The Surface `S`**: This is a sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **The Vector Field on the Surface `f(R)`**: At any point on the surface, `r=R`, so the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **The Differential Surface Element `dS`**: For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential area element vector `dS` points radially outward and has a magnitude of `R^2 * sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)`. So, `dS = (R^2 * sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)) * r_hat`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Dot Product `f . dS`**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n\n`f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] . [(R^2 * sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)) * r_hat]`\n\nSince `r_hat . r_hat = 1`, the terms `1/R^2` and `R^2` cancel out:\n\n`f . dS = sin(theta) * d(theta) * d(phi)`\n\nNotice that the result is independent of the radius `R`.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `f . dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `theta` from `0` to `π` and `phi` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_{phi=0}^{2π} ∫_{theta=0}^{π} sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi)`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n\n`= (∫_{phi=0}^{2π} d(phi)) * (∫_{theta=0}^{π} sin(theta) d(theta))`\n\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   `∫_{phi=0}^{2π} d(phi) = [phi]_0^{2π} = 2π`\n*   `∫_{theta=0}^{π} sin(theta) d(theta) = [-cos(theta)]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiplying the results gives the value of the flux:\n\n`Flux = 2π * 2 = 4π`\n\nTo confirm this standard integral, we can use a computational tool.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbols for the angles in spherical coordinates\ntheta, phi = sp.symbols('theta phi')\n\n# The integrand for the surface integral is sin(theta)\nintegrand = sp.sin(theta)\n\n# Calculate the integral over theta from 0 to pi\nintegral_over_theta = sp.integrate(integrand, (theta, 0, sp.pi))\n\n# Calculate the integral over phi from 0 to 2*pi\n# The result is the integral over theta multiplied by the integral over phi\ntotal_integral = sp.integrate(integral_over_theta, (phi, 0, 2*sp.pi))\n\nprint(total_integral)\n```\n<execute_code>\n4*pi\n</execute_code>\n\n**7. Final Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral (flux) we just calculated.\n\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS) = 4π`\n\nThe result is `4π`.

[ (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n\nSince `r_hat . r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies significantly.

The `R^2` term in the denominator of `f` cancels with the `R^2` term in the magnitude of `dS`:\n\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r_hat . r_hat)`\n`f . dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**6. Evaluating the Surface Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `f . dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals since the integrand does not depend on `φ`:\n\n`= ( ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ ) * ( ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ )`\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n*   `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π`\n*   `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiplying the results gives the total flux:\n\n`Flux = 2π * 2 = 4π`\n\nTo be certain of the integral calculation, we can use Python.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for the spherical coordinate angles\ntheta, phi = sympy.symbols('theta phi')\n\n# The integrand is sin(theta)\nintegrand = sympy.sin(theta)\n\n# Perform the double integral over the surface of a sphere\n# Integrate with respect to theta from 0 to pi\nintegral_over_theta = sympy.integrate(integrand, (theta, 0, sympy.pi))\n\n# Integrate the result with respect to phi from 0 to 2*pi\ntotal_surface_integral = sympy.integrate(integral_over_theta, (phi, 0, 2*sympy.pi))\n\nprint(total_surface_integral)\n```\n<execute_code>\n4*pi\n</execute_code>\n**7. Final Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the enclosing surface.\n\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS) = 4π`\n\nThe result is `4π`, which is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`).\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
