    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is likely an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   All three techniques point towards the same conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. (Oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain at least two pi bonds: one C=O bond from the carboxylic acid and one C=C bond (the \"unsaturated\" part). Therefore, the correct formula must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options.\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula like 'C6H12O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    # Find all element-count pairs\n    atoms = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula_str)\n    # Create a dictionary of atom counts\n    atom_counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in atoms}\n    \n    C = atom_counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = atom_counts.get('H', 0)\n    N = atom_counts.get('N', 0)\n    X = atom_counts.get('F', 0) + atom_counts.get('Cl', 0) + atom_counts.get('Br', 0) + atom_counts.get('I', 0)\n    \n    # Calculate DoU\n    dou = C - (H / 2) - (X / 2) + (N / 2) + 1\n    return dou\n\n# Candidate formulas\nformula_A = \"C6H12O2\"\nformula_D = \"C6H10O2\"\n\n# Calculate DoU for each\ndou_A = calculate_dou(formula_A)\ndou_D = calculate_dou(formula_D)\n\nprint(f\"Formula: {formula_A}, Degree of Unsaturation = {dou_A}\")\nprint(f\"Formula: {formula_D}, Degree of Unsaturation = {dou_D}\")\nprint(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\nprint(\"The spectral data indicates the presence of a C=O bond and a C=C bond.\")\nprint(\"This requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2 (1 for C=O, 1 for C=C).\")\nprint(f\"The formula {formula_D} has a DoU of 2, which matches the experimental evidence.\")\n```\nExecution result:\n```\nFormula: C6H12O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 1.0\nFormula: C6H10O2, Degree of Unsaturation = 2.0\n\nAnalysis:\nThe spectral data indicates the presence of a C=O bond and a C=C bond.\nThis requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2 (1 for C=O, 1 for C=C).\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which matches the experimental evidence.\n```\nThe calculation confirms our reasoning.\n\n*   **C6H12O2 (Option A)** has a DoU of 1. This would account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, but it means the rest of the molecule is saturated (no C=C bond). This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data. An example is hexanoic acid.\n*   **C6H10O2 (Option D)** has a DoU of 2. This perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond, which is consistent with all the provided spectral data. An example is 2-hexenoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires combining information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data that the molecule contains an alkene functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group:\n    *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16\n    *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1\n    *   Total mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n*   This fragment strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Evidence and Determining the Formula**\n\nBased on all the evidence, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and C (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: A) C₆H₁₂O₂ and D) C₆H₁₀O₂.\n*   To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   Our evidence points to at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the acid and one for the C=C bond in the chain. So, we are looking for a formula with a DoU of 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(carbons, hydrogens):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation.\"\"\"\n    return carbons + 1 - (hydrogens / 2)\n\n# Option A: C6H12O2\ndou_A = calculate_dou(6, 12)\n\n# Option D: C6H10O2\ndou_D = calculate_dou(6, 10)\n\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation for C6H12O2: {dou_A}\")\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation for C6H10O2: {dou_D}\")\n```\nExecution result:\n```\nDegree of Unsaturation for C6H12O2: 1.0\nDegree of Unsaturation for C6H10O2: 2.0\n```\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A)** has a DoU of 1. This would only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, implying a saturated carbon chain. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which show a C=C bond.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option D)** has a DoU of 2. This perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This is consistent with all the experimental evidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>",

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H12O2\nB) C6H12O\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H10O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
