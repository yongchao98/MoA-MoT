Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution (t ≥ 0)\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, so the new field is `B'_vec = B ĵ`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H'` that governs the time evolution for `t ≥ 0` is `H' = -μ_vec ⋅ B'_vec = -γB S_y`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian `H'`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)`\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix. The evolution operator becomes:\n    `U(t) = exp(iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`\n*   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + isin(θ)σ_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix, we can expand the operator with `θ = γBt/2`:\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y`\n*   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y)|+z⟩`\n*   Since `I|+z⟩ = |+z⟩` and `σ_y|+z⟩ = i|-z⟩`, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + isin(γBt/2)(i|-z⟩) = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value\n*   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we need to calculate `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|γS_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Let's evaluate the expectation value:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ (⟨cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|⟩) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩)`\n*   We use the properties `S_z|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩` and `S_z|-z⟩ = (-ħ/2)|-z⟩`, and the orthogonality of the states (`⟨+z|+z⟩ = 1`, `⟨-z|-z⟩ = 1`, `⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0`). The cross-terms vanish, leaving:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ [cos²(γBt/2)⟨+z|S_z|+z⟩ + sin²(γBt/2)⟨-z|S_z|-z⟩]`\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ [cos²(γBt/2)(ħ/2) + sin²(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)]`\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n*   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 4. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n*   The expression for the expectation value `⟨μ_z⟩(t)` is a cosine function of time. The general form for an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   The coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function is `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
