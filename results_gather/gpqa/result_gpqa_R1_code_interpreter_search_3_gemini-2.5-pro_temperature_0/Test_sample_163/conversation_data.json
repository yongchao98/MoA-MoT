    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_system1 / M_system2).\n\n2.  **Identify the System Type:** Both systems are described as binary star systems that exhibit eclipses and have their radial velocities measured. This means they are \"double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries\".\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars (K1 and K2). The formula is:\n    M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / [2 * π * G * sin³(i)]\n    where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the line of sight and the axis of the orbit).\n\n4.  **Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The fact that the systems exhibit eclipses is crucial. It tells us that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°, and therefore `sin(i)` is very close to 1. For our calculation, we can assume `sin(i) = 1`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Mass Formula:** With `sin(i) = 1`, the formula for the total mass simplifies to:\n    M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / [2 * π * G]\n\n6.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M_system1 / M_system2.\n    M_system1 / M_system2 = { [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [2 * π * G] } / { [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³] / [2 * π * G] }\n\n7.  **Cancel Constant Terms:** The term `2 * π * G` is a universal constant and appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.
