    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR data to identify the functional groups in Compound X.**\n    *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this corresponds to the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR data to determine the specific structure of Compound X.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the other substituent (which must be an electron-donating alkyl group) and meta to the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** The remaining signals must describe the alkyl group at the para position.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the methine proton (1H).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH). This proton is benzylic (attached to the carbon bonded to the ring), which explains its relatively downfield shift. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the methylene group (2H).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The alkyl group has a central CH carbon which is attached to the benzene ring, a methyl group (-CH₃), and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This is a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option (D).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n    *   Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This reagent combination (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, the -COOH group is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be changed.\n    *   **Reaction:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid + Red P / HI → 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the final product from the given options.**\n    *   The calculated product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   Let's compare this with the options:\n        *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group.\n        *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our derived product.\n        *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure; the product is not a carboxylic acid.\n        *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The broadness and integration confirm this assignment.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** We need to piece together the structure of the alkyl group attached at the para position.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a single proton (methine, -CH-) and is the most downfield of the alkyl signals, suggesting it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the methine carbon (the one at 2.9 ppm).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) that is adjacent to both the methine carbon and the methyl group at 0.9 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the structure:** The benzylic carbon (-CH- at 2.9 ppm) is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃, corresponding to the signals at 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm). This entire group is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   The reaction involves reacting Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This reagent combination (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   Therefore, the -COOH group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n    *   Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is (B).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Determine the Structure of Compound X**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a very distinctive, broad absorption that strongly indicates the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp absorption characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch.

The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent (an alkyl group) and meta to the -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** We need to determine the structure of the alkyl group attached to the ring using the remaining signals.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton. Its downfield shift suggests it is the benzylic proton (the -CH- directly attached to the aromatic ring).

This must be the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:** The alkyl group has a central methine carbon (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring. This carbon is also bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This arrangement is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Final Structure of Compound X:** The molecule is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (4) position.

It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain are stable under these conditions.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl isomer.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted product.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect.
