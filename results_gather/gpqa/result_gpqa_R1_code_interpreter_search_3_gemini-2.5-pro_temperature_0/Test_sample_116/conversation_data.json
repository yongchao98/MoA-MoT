    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (atropisomerism), which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the connecting single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by large, bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality:** Due to the large size of these ortho substituents, there is significant steric hindrance that prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is not chiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, and it is the *trans* isomer. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.
