    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   `a` = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2).\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also states that the planets have the same albedo (A_4 = A_2). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio.\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [(1 / a_4)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)]\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_4), we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    T² ∝ a³  or  T²/a³ = constant\n    Therefore, for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    T_2² / a_2³ = T_4² / a_4³\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Rearrange the equation from Kepler's Third Law to solve for a_2 / a_4.\n    a_2³ / a_4³ = T_2² / T_4²\n    (a_2 / a_4)³ = (T_2 / T_4)²\n    a_2 / a_4 = (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now substitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) back into our simplified temperature ratio equation.\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [(T_2 / T_4)^(2/3)]^(1/2)\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (T_2 / T_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as T_1 : T_2 : T_3 : T_4 : T_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio T_2 / T_4:\n    T_2 / T_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation and compute the result.\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use a simple python script.\n```python\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is (T2/T4)^(1/3)\n# where T2 and T4 are the orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4.\n# From the problem statement, the ratio of periods is T2:T4 = 2:3.5\n\nperiod_ratio_T2_over_T4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The temperature ratio is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_T2_over_T4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n>>>0.829865553125153\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.83.

This energy decreases with the square of the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nwhere 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\nThe problem states that the planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, so other factors in the full equilibrium temperature equation cancel out.\n\n**2.

    "Here's the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius (or semi-major axis, 'a').\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, so all other factors in the full equilibrium temperature equation cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n2.  **Formulating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Based on the relationship above, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (√a_2) / (√a_4) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n3.  **Using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    We can write this as a ratio for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    (P_2 / P_4)² = (a_2 / a_4)³\n\n4.  **Connecting the Ratios:**\n    We need to find the value of (a_2 / a_4) to plug into our temperature ratio equation. We can rearrange the Kepler's Third Law relationship:\n    a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, substitute this expression back into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    When raising a power to another power, the exponents multiply: (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3.\n    So, the final relationship is:\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n    The problem gives the orbital period ratios as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    Therefore, P_2 = 2 and P_4 = 3.5 in these relative units.\n    T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4.\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```"
