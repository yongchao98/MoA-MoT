    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The problem is about a quantum mechanical wave function. The fundamental principle is that the total probability of finding a particle in the region where it is known to exist must be 1 (or 100%). This is called the normalization condition.\n\n2.  **Define the probability density:** The probability of finding a particle at a specific position `x` is not given by the wave function `ψ(x)` itself, but by its probability density function, `P(x)`. The probability density is the square of the modulus of the wave function, `P(x) = |ψ(x)|²`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the modulus squared of the given wave function:**\n    *   The wave function is given as a complex number: `ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i`.\n    *   A complex number `z` has the form `z = real + i * imaginary`.
