    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   Initial state: A nucleus of mass M at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Final state: The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call their rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say `m1` is the more massive one, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Mass sum: The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Conservation laws: The process is a decay from rest, so momentum is conserved (initial momentum is zero, final total momentum is zero). Total energy is also conserved.\n    *   Objective: Find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1`. First, calculate the correct relativistic value (`T1_rel`). Second, calculate the value using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation (`T1_classical`). Finally, find the difference: `|T1_rel - T1_classical|`.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Calculate the rest masses of the fragments.**\n    *   We have a system of two equations for `m1` and `m2`:\n        1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n        2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   Substitute (1) into (2): `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M` which gives `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, so `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n    *   Then, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n    *   Now, let's find their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n        *   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n    *   The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 198 + 99 = 297 GeV`. This is indeed 99% of 300 GeV.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n    *   The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy. It's the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n    *   `Q = T_total = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   So, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy (T1_rel).**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is 0. The two fragments must fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`. So, `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    *   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   For fragment 1: `E1^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2`\n    *   For fragment 2: `E2^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m2*c^2)^2`\n    *   From these, we can equate the `(p*c)^2` terms: `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Rearranging gives: `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Factoring the difference of squares: `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total final energy `E_final = E1 + E2` must equal the total initial energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Now we can substitute the known values into the factored equation:\n        *   `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n        *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m1*c^2 - m2*c^2 = 198 GeV - 99 GeV = 99 GeV`\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (99 GeV) * (297 GeV)`\n    *   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV`.\n    *   Now we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n        1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n        2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n    *   Adding the two equations: `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`, which gives `E1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n    *   The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    *   `T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Calculate the classical kinetic energy (T1_classical).**\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n    *   We know `m1 = 2 * m2`, so `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, or `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is `Q = 3 GeV`, so `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Step 5: Calculate the difference.**\n    *   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   The question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    *   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n7.  **Final Check using Python:**\n    To ensure accuracy, I will perform the calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Initial values\nE_initial_GeV = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M\n# m1 = 0.66 * M\nm1c2_GeV = 0.66 * E_initial_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = 0.33 * E_initial_GeV\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ_GeV = E_initial_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# We have the system of equations:\n# E1 + E2 = E_initial_GeV\n# E1 - E2 = ((m1c2_GeV**2) - (m2c2_GeV**2)) / E_initial_GeV\nE1_plus_E2 = E_initial_GeV\nE1_minus_E2 = (m1c2_GeV**2 - m2c2_GeV**2) / E_initial_GeV\n\n# Solve for E1\nE1_GeV = (E1_plus_E2 + E1_minus_E2) / 2.0\n\n# Calculate relativistic kinetic energy T1\nT1_rel_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2_GeV\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1_classical = Q * (m2 / (m1 + m2))\n# m2 / (m1 + m2) = (0.33*M) / (0.99*M) = 1/3\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV * (m2c2_GeV / (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV))\n\n# --- Difference ---\ndifference_GeV = T1_rel_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_rel_GeV:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\nThe calculation confirms the result.

Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\nWe know `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**7.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial state and parameters:**\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n\n**2. Define the final state and parameters:**\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   `m1` is the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**3. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nConvert these masses to rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n`Q = T_total = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\nIn classical mechanics, for a decay from rest, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2 = p`). The kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\nWe must use the principles of conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The magnitudes of the momenta are equal, `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before equals the total energy after. The total energy of a particle is `E = T + m*c^2`.\n    `E_initial = E1 + E2`\n    `300 GeV = E1 + E2`\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nFrom this, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\nWe know `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_rel = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**7.
