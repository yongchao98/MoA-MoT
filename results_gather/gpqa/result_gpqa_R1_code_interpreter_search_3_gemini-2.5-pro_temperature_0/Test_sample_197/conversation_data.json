    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Species:** The cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n    *   Free Co(II) ion: Co^2+\n    *   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]+\n    *   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)2]\n    *   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)3]-\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)4]2-\n\n3.  **Define Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants:** The formation of each complex is governed by its overall stability constant (βn):\n    *   β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]) = 9\n    *   β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) = 40\n    *   β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) = 63\n    *   β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4) = 16\n\n5.  **Express Concentrations in Terms of [Co^2+]:** We can rearrange the stability constant equations to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co^2+], and the thiocyanate ligand concentration, [SCN-].\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n    *   [[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n    *   [[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\n6.  **Formulate the Fraction of the Desired Complex:** The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α2, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substitute the expressions from steps 3 and 5 into this equation:\n    α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1*[Co^2+]*[SCN-] + β2*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^4)\n\n    The [Co^2+] term is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n    α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n7.  **Approximate the Ligand Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 10^-2 M) is significantly smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means that the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is small compared to the total amount of thiocyanate. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of free thiocyanate, [SCN-], with its initial total concentration.\n    [SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n8.  **Calculate the Value:** Now, substitute the given numerical values into the formula for α2.\n    *   [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n    *   β1 = 9\n    *   β2 = 40\n    *   β3 = 63\n    *   β4 = 16\n\n    First, calculate the individual terms in the denominator:\n    *   Term for n=0 (representing free Co^2+): 1\n    *   Term for n=1: β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for n=2: β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Term for n=3: β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term for n=4: β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    Next, sum these terms to find the denominator:\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    The numerator is the term for n=2:\n    Numerator = 0.4\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction α2:\n    α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n9.  **Convert to Percentage:** To get the final answer, convert the fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100.\n    Percentage = α2 * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches option A. To ensure the precision of the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)2]) is given by alpha_2.\n# alpha_2 = (beta_2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta_1*[SCN-] + beta_2*[SCN-]^2 + beta_3*[SCN-]^3 + beta_4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# Calculate the terms for the denominator sum (often denoted as the function F_0)\nterm0 = 1  # Represents the fraction of free Co2+ relative to itself\nterm1 = beta1 * (scn_conc ** 1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc ** 3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc ** 4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all these terms, representing the ratio of total cobalt to free cobalt.\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator for alpha_2 is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex.\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: {percentage}%\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: 16.91618032648228%\n<<<\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires us to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This mole fraction, often denoted as α₂, can then be expressed as a percentage.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt species:**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) can exist as the free ion or as various thiocyanato complexes. The species are:\n*   Co²⁺ (free ion)\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ (monothiocyanato complex)\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] (dithiocyanato complex)\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (trithiocyanato complex)\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (tetrathiocyanato complex)\n\n**2.

Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**4. Formulate the mole fraction (α₂) for the desired complex:**\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term is common in the numerator and all terms of the denominator, so it cancels out:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5.

The fact that the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is much larger than the metal concentration (0.01 M) justifies using the given [SCN⁻] as the equilibrium concentration.\n\nWe will now use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (alpha_2) is:\n# alpha_2 = (beta_2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta_1*[SCN-] + beta_2*[SCN-]^2 + beta_3*[SCN-]^3 + beta_4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# Calculate the numerator\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * (scn_conc ** 1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc ** 3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc ** 4)\n\n# Calculate the denominator by summing the terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9%\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.
