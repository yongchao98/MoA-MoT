    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration):**\nThe problem provides signals with the following integrations: 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\nThe total number of protons observed in the spectrum is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The molecular formula has 8 hydrogen atoms. This matches the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The molecular formula has 10 hydrogen atoms. This does not match the NMR data.\n\nThis initial analysis eliminates the butenyl acetate options (B and D), leaving us with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Signal:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Interpretation:** A signal with an integration of 3H that is a singlet (s) in the range of 2.0-2.2 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). These protons are not adjacent to any other protons, hence they appear as a singlet. Both propenyl acetate isomers contain this group, so this signal is consistent with both remaining options.\n\n**3. Analyze the Alkene Protons and their Coupling:**\nThe signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm are in the chemical shift range for vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **Signal:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a single vinylic proton that is split into a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one other proton. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The coupling constant between two vinylic protons is dependent on their stereochemistry.\n    *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) has a J-value typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) has a J-value typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz is large and falls squarely in the range for *trans* coupling. This strongly indicates that the double bond has a *trans* geometry, eliminating Cis-propenyl acetate.\n\n**4. Confirm the Structure with the Remaining Signals:**\nBased on the analysis so far, the compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify that the entire spectrum matches this structure.\n\n**Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n```\n      H(b)   H(c)\n       \\   /\n    H3C(a)-C = C - O - C(=O) - CH3(d)\n```\n\n*   **Protons (d) [-C(=O)-CH₃]:** These are the acetate methyl protons. They have no adjacent protons. This corresponds to the **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** signal. (Matches)\n*   **Protons (a) [CH₃-C=]:** This is a methyl group attached to the double bond. It is adjacent to one proton, H(b). Therefore, it should be a doublet (d). This corresponds to the **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** signal. (Matches)\n*   **Proton (c) [=C-H(c)-O]:** This vinylic proton is attached to the carbon bearing the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it and shifts it far downfield. It is coupled only to H(b). This corresponds to the **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** signal. (Matches)\n*   **Proton (b) [CH₃-C-H(b)=]:** This vinylic proton is coupled to two different groups: proton H(c) and the three protons of the methyl group (a).\n    *   Coupling to H(c) splits the signal into a doublet (d).\n    *   Coupling to the three protons of CH₃(a) splits the signal into a quartet (q).\n    *   The resulting multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to the **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** signal. (Matches)\n\nAll signals in the provided 1H NMR data are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>",
