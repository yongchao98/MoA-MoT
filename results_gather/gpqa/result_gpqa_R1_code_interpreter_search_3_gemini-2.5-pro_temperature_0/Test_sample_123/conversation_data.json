    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves two key concepts from physics:\n    *   **Radioactive Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time. The number of particles `N` remaining after a time `t` from an initial population `N₀` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle. The time `t` in this formula is the time measured in the particle's own rest frame (proper time).\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving clock runs slower than a stationary one. The time elapsed in the lab's frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time elapsed in the particle's frame (`t_proper`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_proper`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Fraction:**\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive is `f = N(t_proper) / N₀`.\n    *   Using the decay law, this fraction is `f = exp(-t_proper / τ)`.\n    *   We need to express `t_proper` in terms of the given quantities.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight:**\n    *   In the lab frame, the particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`.\n    *   Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Relate Lab Time to Proper Time:**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula, the time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `t_proper` into the survival fraction formula:\n        `f = exp(-( (R / c) / γ ) / τ)`\n        `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n6.  **Set up the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This constant depends on the detector size and the particle's intrinsic lifetime, so it's the same for both scenarios. The survival fraction formula becomes `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Plugging these in: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?`\n        *   Survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   Plugging these in: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    *   We can solve for `γ₂` by first finding the constant `K` from Scenario 1 and then using it in Scenario 2.\n    *   From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   From Scenario 2, also take the natural logarithm:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n        `K = -γ₂ * (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `K = γ₂ * (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, equate the two expressions for `K`:\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   To get the final number, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Derived formula for the new Lorentz factor\ngamma_1 = 20\nf_1 = 1/3\nf_2 = 2/3\n\n# The formula can also be written as gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(f_1) / ln(f_2)\n# which simplifies to gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.18.

    "The user wants me to solve a problem involving special relativity and particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the core concepts:**\n*   **Particle Decay:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time is described by the exponential decay law. In terms of the particle's own time (proper time, `t_p`), the fraction is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower than a stationary observer's clock. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n**2. Formulate the problem mathematically:**\n*   The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n*   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n*   The proper time experienced by the particles during their flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n*   Substituting this proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction:\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ) = exp(- (R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n**3. Set up equations for the two scenarios:**\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This value is constant for both scenarios because the detector radius `R` and the particle's lifetime `τ` do not change. The survival fraction is now `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Equation: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   Survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Equation: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n**4. Solve for the unknown Lorentz factor `γ₂`:**\nWe can solve this system of equations. A convenient way is to take the natural logarithm of both equations to eliminate the exponential.\n\nFrom `f = exp(-K / γ)`, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which can be rearranged to `γ * ln(f) = -K`.\nSince `-K` is a constant, we can write:\n`γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\nNow, plug in the known values:\n`20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\nSolve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)`\n\nWe can simplify the logarithms: `ln(1/3) = -ln(3)` and `ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) = -(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -ln(3/2)`.\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n**5. Calculate the numerical value:**\nTo get the final answer, we can compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n</execute_code>\n<code_output>\n54.18839183013329\n</code_output>\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` is approximately 54.19.

    "The problem describes the decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles that survive a journey of a certain duration is determined by their mean proper lifetime and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a proper time `t_p` (the time measured in the particle's own reference frame) is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Due to special relativity, the time experienced by the moving particle (`t_p`) is shorter than the time measured by an observer in the lab (`t_lab`). This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_p`\n    Therefore, the proper time is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall, a distance equal to the radius `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Survival Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t_p` and `t_lab` into the decay law, we get the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp(- (t_lab / γ) / τ ) = exp(- (R / c) / (γ * τ) )`\n    This can be written as:\n    `f = exp(- (R / (c * τ)) / γ )`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Unknown:** Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`.
