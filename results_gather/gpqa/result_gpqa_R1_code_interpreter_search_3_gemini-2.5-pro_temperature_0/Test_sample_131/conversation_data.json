Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This means the signals from each compound will contribute equally to the total integration.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the mixture is 1:1, this implies that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and both singlets represent the same number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals must come from the methyl (or ethyl) groups of the two compounds combined.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, multiplicity, and integration for the protons in each of the four possible compounds. The key is to identify chemically equivalent protons based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are equivalent.

The aliphatic signals have a 6H:3H:3H or 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent.

Evaluate the Options Based on the Combined Spectra**\n\nNow we combine the spectra for the pairs in each option, assuming a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined: **Two singlets, ratio 2H:2H = 1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H and 6H).

This contradicts the data, which states there are only three aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the combined spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). Combined, this would give five signals, unless some overlap. If the 6H signals from both compounds overlap, we would have three signals with integrations of (6H+6H), 3H, and 3H. The total integrations would be 12H, 3H, 3H, giving a ratio of 4:1:1. This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**5.

    "This problem requires us to predict the 1H NMR spectra for several isomers of tetramethylbenzene and then determine which 1:1 mixture of two of these compounds would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All the options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This is crucial for determining the relative integrations of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute one aromatic singlet, and these singlets must represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals arise from the methyl groups of both compounds combined.\n\n**2.

The protons on the CH2 group will be split by the protons on the CH3 group, and vice-versa. This will result in a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not singlets. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated. This rules out option C.\n\n**3.

In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each representing 2H, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H and 6H). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.

The combined spectrum would have at least three signals, and up to five if none overlap. If the 6H signals overlap, the integrations would be (6+6)H, 6H, 3H, 3H, which is 12H:6H:3H:3H.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent (6H) and C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 3 signals total.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups. The protons on the CH2 group will be split by the protons on the CH3 group, resulting in a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region. The problem states that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately ruled out, eliminating any option containing it.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Proposed Mixtures**\n\nWe will now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H and 6H). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **This option is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
