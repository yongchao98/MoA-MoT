    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes. Specifically, it asks for the ratio in the \"no spots\" case divided by the ratio in the \"with spots\" case.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the populations of two energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n3.  **Write Down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in an upper energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   N₂, N₁ are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1.\n    *   g₂, g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   E₂, E₁ are the energies of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n4.  **Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   Let `Ratio_ns` be the population ratio when the star has no spots, at temperature `T_ns = 6000 K`.\n        `Ratio_ns = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_ns))`\n    *   Let `Ratio_s` be the population ratio when the star has spots, at temperature `T_s = 5500 K`.\n        `Ratio_s = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_s))`\n\n5.  **Formulate the Desired Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.
