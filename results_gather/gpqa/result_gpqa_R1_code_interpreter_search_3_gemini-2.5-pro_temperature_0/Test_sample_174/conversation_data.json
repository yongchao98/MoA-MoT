    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The nature of this radiation depends on the time-varying multipole moments of the distribution. The power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, has a characteristic dependence on the angle `θ` and the wavelength `λ`.\n\nWe need to determine which multipole moment dominates the radiation based on the problem description.\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Source:** The source is described as an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This description strongly suggests a shape oscillation. A common example is a spherical charge distribution that deforms periodically, stretching into a prolate spheroid and compressing into an oblate spheroid along the z-axis. If the center of charge remains at the origin, the electric dipole moment is zero. The lowest-order, non-vanishing radiating moment is the electric quadrupole moment. The presence of option D, which perfectly matches the characteristics of quadrupole radiation, further suggests this is the intended physical model.\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** For a linear electric quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle `dP/dΩ` is proportional to `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`.\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n\n3.  **Finding the Maximum Power (A):** We need to find the maximum value of the angular function `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. We can rewrite this as:\n    `g(θ) = (sin(θ)cos(θ))² = ( (1/2)sin(2θ) )² = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`\n    The maximum value of `g(θ)` occurs when `sin²(2θ)` is maximum, which is 1. This happens when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\n    The maximum value is `g(45°) = 1/4`. The maximum radiated power, `A`, is proportional to this value: `A ∝ 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Power at θ = 30°:** We evaluate the angular function at `θ = 30°`:\n    `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`.\n    The power radiated at 30° is proportional to `3/16`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power.\n    Fraction = `g(30°) / g(45°) = (3/16) / (1/4) = 3/16 * 4 = 3/4`.\n\n6.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence:** The total power radiated by an electric multipole of order `l` is proportional to `ω^(2l+2)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    *   For an electric dipole, `l=1`, so `P ∝ ω⁴`.\n    *   For an electric quadrupole, `l=2`, so `P ∝ ω⁶`.\n    Since `ω = 2πc/λ`, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁶ = λ⁻⁶`. The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`, has the same wavelength dependence.\n    Therefore, a possible form of `f` is proportional to `λ⁻⁶`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `3/4`, and the power dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁶`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The angular dependence for electric quadrupole radiation is sin^2(theta) * cos^2(theta).\n# The maximum power (A) occurs at theta = 45 degrees.\ntheta_max_rad = math.radians(45)\nmax_power_proportional_value = (math.sin(theta_max_rad)**2) * (math.cos(theta_max_rad)**2)\n\n# We want to find the power at theta = 30 degrees.\ntheta_rad = math.radians(30)\npower_at_30_proportional_value = (math.sin(theta_rad)**2) * (math.cos(theta_rad)**2)\n\n# The fraction of A is the ratio of the power at 30 degrees to the maximum power.\nfraction = power_at_30_proportional_value / max_power_proportional_value\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The power and angular distribution of this radiation depend on the time-varying multipole moments of the charge distribution.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Dominant Radiation Type:**\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution that is \"spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". A spheroid is a sphere that has been stretched or compressed along an axis. An oscillation of its shape (e.g., from a prolate spheroid to an oblate spheroid and back) while keeping its center at the origin means that the charge distribution changes, but its center of charge does not move.\n    *   **Electric Dipole Moment:** The electric dipole moment is defined as `p = ∫ r ρ(r) dV`. If the oscillation is symmetric about the origin, the dipole moment `p` remains zero. Therefore, there is no electric dipole radiation.\n    *   **Electric Quadrupole Moment:** The next non-zero multipole moment is the electric quadrupole moment. A shape oscillation of a spheroid along the z-axis creates a time-varying electric quadrupole moment (`Q_zz`). This time-varying quadrupole moment will radiate.\n    Therefore, we conclude that the radiation is predominantly electric quadrupole radiation.\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    For a linear electric quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) has an angular dependence given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle with the z-axis.\n\n3.  **Finding the Maximum Power (A):**\n    The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs at the angle `θ` that maximizes the function `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`.\n    We can rewrite this function using the double-angle identity `sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ)`:\n    `g(θ) = (sin(θ)cos(θ))² = ( (1/2)sin(2θ) )² = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`\n    The maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1, which occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\n    The maximum value of `g(θ)` is `g(45°) = 1/4`. Thus, the maximum power `A` is proportional to `1/4`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Power at θ = 30°:**\n    Now, we calculate the value of the angular function at `θ = 30°`:\n    `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°)`\n    Since `sin(30°) = 1/2` and `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`, we have:\n    `g(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3 / 2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`\n\n5.  **Finding the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    Fraction = `g(30°) / g(45°) = (3/16) / (1/4) = 3/16 * 4 = 12/16 = 3/4`\n\n6.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    The total power radiated by an oscillating electric multipole of order `l` is proportional to `ω^(2l+2)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   For an electric dipole, `l=1`, so `P ∝ ω⁴`.\n    *   For an electric quadrupole, `l=2`, so `P ∝ ω⁶`.\n    Since we identified the radiation as electric quadrupole, the power is proportional to `ω⁶`. The frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n    Therefore, the power per unit solid angle `f = dP/dΩ` has a wavelength dependence of:\n    `f ∝ ω⁶ ∝ (1/λ)⁶ = λ⁻⁶`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `3/4`, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function `f` is `λ⁻⁶`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
