    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the potential is the same in all directions, i.e., the spring constant is the same for x, y, and z directions.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$).\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy States:**\n    *   The **ground state** is the lowest energy state, which corresponds to $n=0$.\n        *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to $n=1$.\n        *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $n=2$.\n        *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n        *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy (Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions):** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the quantum state is specified by a set of three quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The principal quantum number $n$ is the sum of these: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$.\n\n    The degeneracy of the n-th energy level, $g_n$, is the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$. This is a problem from combinatorics, and the formula for the degeneracy is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy for the Third Excited State:** For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Using the degeneracy formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n    Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy of the third excited state.\n\n    *Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:*\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) -> 6 states\n    *   The combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) -> 1 state\n    *   Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   Energy of the third excited state: $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy): 10\n\n    This matches option A. The energy expressions in options C and D are characteristic of a particle in a spherical box, not a harmonic oscillator.\n\n<<<A>>>",
