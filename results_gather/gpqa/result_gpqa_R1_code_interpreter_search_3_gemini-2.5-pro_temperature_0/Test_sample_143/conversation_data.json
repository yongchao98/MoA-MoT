    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Concepts:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) in the lab frame and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n        $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    *   Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau_{rest}$). The two are related by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_{rest}$\n    *   The mean lifetime in the rest frame ($\\tau_{rest}$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The exact relation for an exponential decay is:\n        $\\tau_{rest} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   The velocity ($v$) and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) are determined by the particle's total energy ($E_X$) and its rest mass ($m_X$). The key relativistic relations are:\n        $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$\n        $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$\n        where $p$ is the momentum and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Calculation Strategy:**\n    We can combine the equations from step 2 to derive a single formula for the mean decay distance, $d$.\n    *   Start with $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   Substitute $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_{rest}$: $d = v \\gamma \\tau_{rest}$.\n    *   Substitute $\\tau_{rest} = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$: $d = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   It is often more convenient to work with the product $\\hbar c$. So, let's rewrite the equation as $d = \\frac{v}{c} \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   The term $\\frac{v}{c}$ is the relativistic beta, $\\beta$. So, $d = \\beta \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   We can express the term $\\beta\\gamma$ using energy and momentum. From $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$ and $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$, we can find that $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{p c}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   The final formula is:\n        $d = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   To use this formula, we first need to calculate the momentum term, $pc$, from the given energy and mass.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm} = 197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ MeV m}$\n    *   **Step a: Calculate $pc$.**\n        From $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$, we have:\n        $(pc)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2$\n        $(pc)^2 = (8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2 = 64,000,000 - 1,440,000 = 62,560,000 \\text{ (MeV)}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.488 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Step b: Substitute all values into the formula for $d$.**\n        $d = \\frac{7909.488 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\times \\frac{197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ MeV m}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n        $d \\approx 6.59124 \\times (0.616647 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m})$\n        $d \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.
