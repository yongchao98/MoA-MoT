    "Reduced mass (mu): 3.0192e-27 kg\nMoment of inertia (I): 1.2077e-46 J*s^2\nRotational constant (B): 4.6001e-23 J\nTransition energy (delta_E): 9.2002e-23 J\nPhoton momentum (p): 3.0689e-31 N*s\n\nWait, let me re-read the question. \"what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\". My calculation of the lowest energy transition is correct (pure rotational). However, the calculated momentum `p = 3.07e-31 N*s` does not match any of the options. The options are in the range of 10^-27 to 10^-28 N*s. This suggests the energy of the transition is much higher.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"next state\". While the pure rotational state is the lowest *energy* state, perhaps the question implies a rovibrational transition, which is a very common type of transition studied in IR spectroscopy. Let's calculate the energy and momentum for the rovibrational transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n\n**Recalculating for Rovibrational Transition (v=0, J=0 -> v=1, J=1)**\n\nThe energy for this transition is:\nΔE_rovib = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = (ħω + 2B)\n\nLet's calculate this new ΔE and the corresponding momentum `p`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.0545718e-34  # J*s\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27 # kg/amu\nangstrom_to_m = 1e-10 # m/angstrom\nc = 299792458 # m/s\n\n# Given values\nMx_amu = 20\nMy_amu = 2\nR_angstrom = 2\nw = 4e14 # rad/s\n\n# Convert to SI units\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\n\n# 1.

The total energy is dominated by the vibrational part. The calculated momentum for the pure rotational transition was ~3 x 10⁻³¹ N·s, which is far from any of the options. The calculated momentum for the rovibrational transition (v=0, J=0 → v=1, J=1) is ~1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, which matches option C.\n\nTherefore, despite the pure rotational state being the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" in absolute terms, the context of the problem and the provided options strongly indicate that the intended transition is the lowest-energy *rovibrational* transition, which is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n\n**Final Calculation Summary:**\n1.  **Initial State:** E(0,0) = (1/2)ħω\n2.  **Final State:** E(1,1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n3.  **Photon Energy:** ΔE = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = ħω + 2B\n4.  **Calculated Values:**\n    *   ħω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.2183e-20 J\n    *   2B = 9.2002e-23 J\n    *   ΔE = 4.2183e-20 J + 9.2002e-23 J ≈ 4.2275e-20 J\n5.  **Photon Momentum:** p = ΔE / c = 4.2275e-20 J / (2.998e8 m/s) ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
