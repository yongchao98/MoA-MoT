    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents attached.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the functional groups is a C=O.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to one of the carbons in the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Propose a Chemical Structure**\n\nLet's combine the clues to build the molecule:\n*   We have a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (let's denote it as -X). A halogen atom has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   A group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its chemical formula is C8H7XO.\n\nThis structure fits all the initial criteria:\n*   It has a di-substituted benzene ring.\n*   It has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl group) = 8 carbon atoms.\n*   It has a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   It has an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**3. Consider the Possible Isomers and Predict their 1H NMR Spectra**\n\nThe two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three different ways on the benzene ring: *ortho*, *meta*, or *para*.\n\n*   ***ortho*-haloacetophenone**: The two substituents are on adjacent carbons (1,2-substitution). This molecule has no plane of symmetry. We would expect four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns.\n*   ***meta*-haloacetophenone**: The substituents are on carbons 1 and 3 (1,3-substitution). This molecule also has no plane of symmetry. We would expect four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting.\n*   ***para*-haloacetophenone**: The substituents are on opposite carbons (1,4-substitution). This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n    *   This symmetry makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent.\n    *   It also makes the two protons next to the halogen atom equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, we expect to see only two signals for the aromatic protons. Each signal will be a **doublet** (due to splitting by its one non-equivalent neighbor) and will integrate to **2H**.\n*   **Common feature for all isomers**: The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is not adjacent to any protons, so it will always appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.2-2.7 ppm.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given 1H NMR Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the spectrum of an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 protons on the ring. This spectrum only shows one proton in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a singlet for 3 protons in the expected region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (`-COCH3`).\n    *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **p-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is p-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option D is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the molecular formula and functional groups.**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which is a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. This means the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR data indicates a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (a halogen atom directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n    *   Let's assemble the substituents. One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains 0 carbon atoms. The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common functional group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Consider the possible isomers and their expected ¹H NMR patterns.**\n    *   The two substituents (acetyl and halogen) can be arranged in three ways: *ortho*, *meta*, or *para*.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2-disubstituted):** This isomer has no plane of symmetry. It would show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns.\n    *   **Meta (1,3-disubstituted):** This isomer also has no plane of symmetry and would also show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting.\n    *   **Para (1,4-disubstituted):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry that passes through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to the acetyl group equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the halogen equivalent. This results in a very characteristic pattern: two signals in the aromatic region, each appearing as a **doublet (d)** and each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **The Acetyl Group:** In all isomers, the methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is not adjacent to any protons. Therefore, it will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.2-2.7 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the given ¹H NMR data options.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a methyl ketone. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons, but this spectrum does not reflect that. The integration for the upfield singlet is 2H, not 3H as required for a methyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This pattern of two doublets, each for two protons, is the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n        *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a singlet for three protons at a chemical shift characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n        *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the Molecular Structure from the Description**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: The core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two other groups attached to it. A benzene ring itself has the formula C₆H₆, so a di-substituted ring has a C₆H₄ core.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the functional groups is a C=O.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Putting it together**: One substituent is a halogen (-X), which has zero carbon atoms. The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Isomers and Predict the ¹H NMR Pattern**\n    *   The two substituents (the halogen and the acetyl group) can be arranged in three possible ways: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   The number of protons on the aromatic ring will be 4 in all cases.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is isolated from other protons, so it will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its chemical shift is typically in the 2.2-2.7 ppm range.\n    *   Now, let's consider the aromatic protons:\n        *   For *ortho* and *meta* isomers, there is no plane of symmetry. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely creating a complex, overlapping pattern of multiplets.\n        *   For the ***para* isomer**, there is a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This makes the two protons next to the carbonyl group equivalent and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent. This leads to a very clean and characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the Provided ¹H NMR Options**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (which is ~6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum does not show 4 aromatic protons. The upfield singlet integrates to 2H, not the 3H required for a methyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring (two doublets, each for 2H).\n        *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which is exactly what is expected for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Identify the molecular structure.**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which is a benzene ring (C₆H₄ core).\n    *   It has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined 2 carbons.\n    *   FTIR shows a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (a halogen, -X, attached to the ring).\n    *   One substituent is the halogen (-X), which has 0 carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. This is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   The molecule is a haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR spectrum based on isomerism.**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* positions.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent will always be a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, as it has no adjacent protons. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.2-2.7 ppm.\n    *   The aromatic region will have 4 protons.\n    *   For *ortho* and *meta* isomers, the lack of symmetry would lead to four distinct and complex signals for the 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   For the ***para* (1,4) isomer**, there is a plane of symmetry. This makes the protons on opposite sides of the ring equivalent.
