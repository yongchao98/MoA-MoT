    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism**, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). This hydrogen can be removed, and a double bond can form, converting the keto form to an enol form.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite positions. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is a -CH2- group, meaning they have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism to form its enol, and ultimately its most stable tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Such a molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group.\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`. This is a planar molecule (or nearly planar). It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, which makes it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Combination**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism for Compound A**\n    *   **Tautomerism**, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is a chemical equilibrium between a keto form (a compound containing a carbonyl group) and an enol form (a compound containing a hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon with a double bond).\n    *   A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Let's examine benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Let's examine cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a -CH₂- group, meaning they each have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows this compound to readily tautomerize to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound B**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Let's examine methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Let's examine dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and is achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem asks us to identify two compounds based on their chemical properties: one that does not show tautomerism (A) and one that shows optical isomerism (B).\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert through a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. For the given compounds, we are interested in keto-enol tautomerism.

    "This question requires us to apply our knowledge of two types of isomerism: tautomerism and optical isomerism. Let's break down the problem into two parts.\n\n### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism\n\n**Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible isomers. The most common type is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which involves the migration of a proton and the shifting of a double bond. A crucial requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of these double bonds. As a result, they are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.
