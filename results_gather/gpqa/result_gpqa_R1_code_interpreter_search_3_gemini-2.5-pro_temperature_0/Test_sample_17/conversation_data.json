    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Notation**\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, relative to the Sun. The formula is:\n`[X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star ) - log10( (nX/nY)_sun )`\n\nThis can be rearranged to:\n`(nX/nY)_star = 10^[X/Y] * (nX/nY)_sun`\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. In the context of stellar abundances, this refers to the ratio of the abundance fractions, which is `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`. The masses of the stars are extra information not needed for this calculation, which focuses on the chemical composition ratios.\n\n**2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance in Star_1**\n\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\nWe want to find `(nSi/nH)_1`. We can express this as:\n`(nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1`\n\nNow, let's use the given values to find the terms on the right side relative to the Sun:\n*   From `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`:\n    `(nFe/nH)_1 = 10^0 * (nFe/nH)_sun = (nFe/nH)_sun`\n*   From `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`:\n    `(nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun`\n\nSubstitute these back into the equation for `(nSi/nH)_1`:\n`(nSi/nH)_1 = (10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun) * (nFe/nH)_sun`\n`(nSi/nH)_1 = 10^0.3 * ( (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ) * (nFe/nH)_sun`\n`(nSi/nH)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n\n**3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance in Star_2**\n\nWe are given the following for Star_2:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\nWe want to find `(nSi/nH)_2`. We can relate this to the given magnesium abundance:\n`(nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_2`\n\nNow, let's use the given values to find the terms on the right side relative to the Sun:\n*   From `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`:\n    `(nMg/nH)_2 = 10^0 * (nMg/nH)_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun`\n*   From `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`:\n    `(nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun`\n\nSubstitute these back into the equation for `(nSi/nH)_2`:\n`(nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun / (10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun)`\n`(nSi/nH)_2 = (1 / 10^0.3) * ( (nMg/nH)_sun / (nMg/nSi)_sun )`\n`(nSi/nH)_2 = 10^-0.3 * ( (nMg/nH)_sun / ( (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun ) )`\n`(nSi/nH)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow we can compute the ratio of the silicon abundances in the two stars:\n`Ratio = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`\n`Ratio = ( 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun ) / ( 10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n\nThe solar abundance term `(nSi/nH)_sun` cancels out:\n`Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n`Ratio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate 10 to the power of 0.6\nratio = 10**0.6\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3.9810717055349722\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 3.98.\n\n**5.
