    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structures**\n\nThe products of both reactions are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (a pyran ring). It is saturated (\"tetrahydro\") and has a carbonyl group at position 2 (\"2-one\"), making it a delta-lactone. An ethyl group is attached at position 4.\n*   **Chirality:** The carbon at position 4 (C4) is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups (a hydrogen, an ethyl group, C3 of the ring, and C5 of the ring).\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones like this are typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. In this case, the precursor would be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereocenter at C3 of this acid corresponds to the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone.\n\n    ```\n    HO-CH2(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)  <-- (acid-catalyzed cyclization) -->  Lactone + H2O\n    ```\n*   The stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center of the acid is retained as the C4 stereocenter in the lactone.\n    *   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   **Structure:** This name describes a molecule that is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (also known as glutaric acid). It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester group (-CO-O-iBu) at the other. An ethyl group is attached at the C3 position.\n    ```\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-CH2CH(CH3)2\n    ```\n*   **Chirality:** This molecule has a single chiral center at C3, where the ethyl group is attached. The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group (-CO-O-iBu) at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 will remain largely unreacted.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        ```\n        HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu  --(1. LiBH4)-->  HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n        ```\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy-acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent with a different selectivity. It is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (-CO-O-iBu) at C5 will remain unreacted.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is (R/S)-isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        ```\n        HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu  --(1. BH3)-->  HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu\n        ```\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, these steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of starting material B is the same as the stereochemistry of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",

    "This problem tests the understanding of the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents on a molecule with two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n**Summary of Reagent Selectivity:**\n\n*   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** A moderately strong reducing agent. It effectively reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It reduces carboxylic acids very slowly, so for practical purposes, it is considered selective for esters over carboxylic acids.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** A reducing agent that shows a strong preference for reducing carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction A:**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n2.  **Starting Material:** The starting material, A, is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, which has a carboxylic acid at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other. It has a chiral center at the 3-position.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n3.  **Mechanism:** Since LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester, the ester group (-CO-O-iBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left unchanged. This forms a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid intermediate.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n4.  **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at the 3-position (which becomes the 4-position in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is the same as the product. Since the product is the (R)-lactone, starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B:**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n2.  **Starting Material:** B is an enantiomer of A.\n3.  **Mechanism:** Since BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid, the -COOH group is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the ester group (-CO-O-iBu) is left unchanged. This forms a 5-hydroxy ester intermediate.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n4.  **Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (HO-iBu) to form the lactone.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is not affected.

    "This problem requires an understanding of the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents, specifically lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting material in the options is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu). It also has a single chiral center at the carbon with the ethyl group (C3).\n*   **Reagent 1 (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. Therefore, in a molecule with both groups, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the **ester**.\n*   **Reagent 2 (BH₃):** Borane is also a selective reducing agent, but with the opposite preference. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, BH₃ will preferentially reduce the **carboxylic acid**.\n*   **Product:** The product is a lactone (a cyclic ester), which is formed by an intramolecular reaction between a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) within the same molecule.
