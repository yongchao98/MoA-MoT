    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The two substituents on the double bond are identical (propyl groups).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism with *anti*-attack by water.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) results in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the anti-addition to an (E)-alkene with identical substituents is that it produces a **meso** compound.\n    *   Let's verify this: (E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso product.\n    *   The product is octane-4,5-diol. The specific stereoisomer is meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also with identical propyl substituents.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also a net *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the anti-addition to a (Z)-alkene with identical substituents is that it produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this: (Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic product.\n    *   The products are the two enantiomers of octane-4,5-diol: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture containing two compounds, **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-(4R,5S) diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe mixture of these three compounds is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (e.g., same polarity, boiling point). Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated by an achiral column, appearing as **distinct peaks**.\n    *   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol is a diastereomer to this pair and will elute at a different time, appearing as a second peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities. This allows for their separation into **distinct peaks**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also separated, as they are different compounds.\n    *   In our mixture, all three compounds will be resolved: the meso-diol, the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two, so it will have a different retention time and appear as a **separate peak**.\n        *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair. **Total = 2 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment inside the column.\n        *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**.
