    "This is a classic problem involving exponential decay, which is a memoryless process. Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve it.\n\n**1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. A key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom doesn't \"age\". So, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes doesn't change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the next minute, hour, or any other time interval.\n\n**2. Define the Survival Probability**\n\nLet P(t) be the probability that the atom survives for a time t. The decay law is given by:\nP(t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability of the atom decaying within time t is therefore:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nWe don't need to calculate λ explicitly. We can use this relationship directly.\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, this is equivalent to asking for the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nNow, we need to express e^(-λ * 150) in terms of what we know (e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68). We can use the properties of exponents:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nSubstitute the known value:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow we can calculate the final probability of decay in 150 minutes:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# This corresponds to exp(-lambda * 100).\nprob_survive_100 = 0.68\n\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property, this is 1 - P(survive 150 minutes).\n# P(survive 150 minutes) = exp(-lambda * 150)\n# We can write this as (exp(-lambda * 100))^(150/100) or (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5.\nprob_survive_150 = prob_survive_100 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival.\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survive_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(f\"{prob_decay_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that the probability is approximately 43.93%. This is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential law. A crucial characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\" or get \"weaker\". The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior.\n\nTherefore, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the probability a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**2. Formulate the Decay and Survival Probabilities**\n\nLet λ be the decay constant of the atom.\nThe probability that the atom *survives* for a time `t` is given by the survival function:\nP_survive(t) = e^(-λt)\n\nThe probability that the atom *decays* within a time `t` is:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nThis value, `e^(-λ * 100)`, is a key parameter we can use for further calculations without needing to find λ itself.\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in 150 minutes.\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can rewrite the term `e^(-λ * 150)` using the properties of exponents and the value we found in the previous step:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value we know (`e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`):\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow we can calculate the final probability of decay:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's compute this value using a simple Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the problem statement, the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# This is equal to exp(-lambda * 100).\nprob_survive_100 = 0.68\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes.\n# This is 1 - P_survive(150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150).\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) as (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5.\nprob_survive_150 = prob_survive_100 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival probability for 150 minutes.\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survive_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in 150 minutes is {prob_decay_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\nThe probability of decay in 150 minutes is 43.93%\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 43.93%.
