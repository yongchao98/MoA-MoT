    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation involving buffer solutions and acid-base equilibria for a polyprotic acid (phosphoric acid, H3PO4).\n\n**1. Understand the System**\nThe solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates completely in water to give K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely in water to give 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n\nThe two main phosphate species in the solution are H2PO4- (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, HPO4^2-. Together, they form a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Moles and Concentrations**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of each phosphate species added to the solution.\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n\nMoles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\nMoles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\nNow, we calculate their initial concentrations:\n*   [H2PO4-] = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.20000 L\n*   [HPO4^2-] = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.20000 L\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which involves the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- conjugate pair.\n*   Equilibrium: H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n*   Equilibrium constant: Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nThe Ka2 expression is:\nKa2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n\nSince the concentrations are in the same volume, the ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\n[H⁺] = Ka2 * (moles of H2PO4⁻ / moles of HPO4²⁻)\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO4³⁻] Concentration**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4²⁻). This is governed by the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid.\n*   Equilibrium: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n*   Equilibrium constant: Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nThe Ka3 expression is:\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4³⁻]:\n[PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nWe will use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4²⁻] (since Ka3 is very small, the amount of HPO4²⁻ that dissociates is negligible and won't significantly change its concentration).\n\n**5.
