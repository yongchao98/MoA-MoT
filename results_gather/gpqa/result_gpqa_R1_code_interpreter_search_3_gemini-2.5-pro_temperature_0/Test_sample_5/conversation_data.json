    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energy spectrum for the given potential.\n\n**1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe potential is given in 2D polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often advantageous to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y), especially if the potential simplifies.\n\n**2. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe standard relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   x = r * cos(θ)\n*   y = r * sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these, we can see that:\n*   x^2 = (r * cos(θ))^2 = r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\nGroup the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**3. Recognize the Separable Potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is a sum of two independent terms, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis is the potential for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent 1D equations, and the total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each dimension: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n**4. Solve for the Energy in the x-dimension**\n\nThe potential for the x-dimension is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. This is the potential of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator, whose standard form is V(x) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * x^2.\n\nBy comparing the two forms, we can find the angular frequency ω_x:\n1/2 * m * ω_x^2 = 2 * k\nω_x^2 = 4k / m\nω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.

Solve for the Energy in the y-dimension**\n\nThe potential for the y-dimension is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2. Comparing this to the standard form V(y) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * y^2:\n1/2 * m * ω_y^2 = 1/2 * k\nω_y^2 = k / m\nω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-dimension, with quantum number n_y, are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y dimensions:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1) * ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nNow, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe quantum numbers n_x and n_y can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**7.
