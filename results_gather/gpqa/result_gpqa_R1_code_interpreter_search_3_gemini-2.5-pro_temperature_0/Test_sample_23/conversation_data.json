    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula:\nMass % H = (m × Ar(H)) / (n × Ar(C) + m × Ar(H)) × 100%\nUsing approximate atomic masses, Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\nThe value 14.28% is very close to 1/7.\n14.28% ≈ 100 / 7 % = 1/7.\nSo, let's set the mass fraction to 1/7:\nm / (12n + m) = 1/7\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\nThis means the general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the hydrogenation reactions.**\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X (two liquids, A and B) gives only Z. This implies that both A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (two liquids, C and D) gives only Z. This implies that both C and D also have the same carbon skeleton as Z, or can be converted to it under \"severe conditions\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze mixture Y and the disproportionation reaction.**\n*   Mixture Y is formed by heating mixture X with platinum. This reaction is a disproportionation.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components (C and D) are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, D must also be saturated or aromatic.\n*   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation. In organic chemistry, this often involves a single substance being simultaneously reduced and oxidized. A common example involving heating with platinum is the catalytic hydrogen transfer (Zelinsky irreversible catalysis), where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into a saturated one (reduction) and an aromatic one (oxidation).\n*   Let's hypothesize the reaction is: Unsaturated Precursor(s) -> Saturated Cycloalkane + Aromatic Compound.\n*   This means Y = {Cycloalkane, Aromatic Compound}.\n    *   Let C = Cycloalkane = Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Let D = Aromatic Compound.\n*   This fits the condition that Y does not decolorize bromine water, as neither saturated alkanes nor aromatic compounds react with Br2(aq) under normal conditions.\n\n**Step 4: Use the final hydrogenation constraint to determine the ring size.**\n*   Hydrogenation of Y (C + D) gives only Z.\n*   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) gives Z.\n*   Therefore, hydrogenation of D (the aromatic compound) must also give Z.\n*   This means the aromatic compound D and the cycloalkane Z must have the same carbon skeleton. Let's test possible ring sizes:\n    *   **C6 case:** If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be an aromatic C6 compound, which is benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. This works.\n        Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). D = Benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene} gives only Cyclohexane. This is consistent.\n    *   **C7 case:** If Z is cycloheptane (C7H14), then D must be an aromatic C7 compound, which is toluene (C7H8). Hydrogenation of toluene gives methylcyclohexane, not cycloheptane. These have different carbon skeletons (a 6-membered ring with a methyl group vs. a 7-membered ring). So, this case fails.\n    *   **C8 case:** If Z is cyclooctane (C8H16), D would be an aromatic C8 compound (e.g., ethylbenzene or xylene). Hydrogenation of these gives ethylcyclohexane or dimethylcyclohexane, not cyclooctane. This case also fails.\n\n*   The only case that works is the C6 system. Thus, we can identify the components of Y and the identity of Z.\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a widely used solvent, fitting the description.\n    *   Y = An equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C) and Benzene (D).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   The reaction A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6) is a 1:1 reaction, which produces the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   This reaction is a hydrogen transfer. One molecule is reduced (gains H), and the other is oxidized (loses H).\n    *   A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   The total atom count on the right is C12H18. Therefore, A+B must also be C12H18.\n*   A and B are unsaturated (X decolorizes bromine water), have a C6 ring skeleton (they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Let's find two C6 unsaturated cyclic molecules that can react via hydrogen transfer to give cyclohexane and benzene. A good pair would be a hydrogen acceptor and a hydrogen donor.\n    *   Hydrogen Acceptor: Cyclohexene (C6H10). It can accept H2 to become cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogen Donor: A cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It can lose H2 to become benzene.\n*   The problem states there are no conjugated bonds in X.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. It is a valid candidate.\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It is a valid candidate.\n*   So, mixture X consists of:\n    *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n*   Let's check the reaction:\n    *   C6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-Cyclohexadiene) -> C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)\n    *   This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. All conditions are met.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in liquid A (Cyclohexene, C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of H atoms in liquid B (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

This is also incorrect.\n\nThe only plausible case is the 6-carbon system.\nThus, we can identify:\n*   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n*   **Mixture Y = An equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane and Benzene (C6H6)**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that reacts to form Y.\n*   **Reaction:** A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (accepts hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (donates hydrogen).\n*   **Properties of X:**\n    1.  It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n    2.  Hydrogenation of both A and B gives cyclohexane, so they must both be C6 cyclic compounds.\n    3.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n\nLet's consider possible unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond (non-conjugated). It can be reduced to cyclohexane. This is a candidate.\n*   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8):**\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded by the problem statement.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It can be reduced to cyclohexane and oxidized to benzene. This is a candidate.\n\nLet's propose that mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   Let B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be:\nC6H10 (hydrogen acceptor) + C6H8 (hydrogen donor) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nThis reaction is balanced and fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent.
