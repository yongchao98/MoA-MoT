    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe key to an efficient synthesis is to introduce the groups in an order that leverages their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Introduce the bromo group (-Br) last.**\n    *   The precursor would be 3-nitroacetophenone.\n    *   In 3-nitroacetophenone, we have two *meta*-directing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2).\n    *   The -COCH3 group at position 1 directs incoming electrophiles to position 5.\n    *   The -NO2 group at position 3 also directs incoming electrophiles to position 5.\n    *   Since both groups direct the incoming bromonium ion (Br+) to the same position (position 5), this reaction (bromination) would be highly regioselective and give the desired product in high yield.\n    *   This suggests the final step should be the bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone.\n    *   The synthesis of the precursor, 3-nitroacetophenone, would be:\n        *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).\n        *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone (Nitration, since -COCH3 is *meta*-directing).\n    *   So, a very good synthetic route is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**. This sequence is not explicitly listed as a complete option.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Introduce the nitro group (-NO2) last.**\n    *   The precursor would be 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, we have a *meta*-directing group (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-directing group (-Br).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. However, when considering the stability of the intermediate arenium ion (sigma complex), nitration at position 5 is favored. Attack at other positions (2, 4, 6) would lead to a resonance structure where a positive charge is placed on the carbon atom directly attached to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group, which is highly unfavorable. Therefore, nitration at position 5 is the major pathway.\n    *   This makes this route a viable, high-yield synthesis.\n    *   The synthesis of the precursor, 3-bromoacetophenone, would be:\n        *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone (Acylation).\n        *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone (Bromination, since -COCH3 is *meta*-directing).\n    *   So, another viable route is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the provided sequences based on our findings.\n\n*   **A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ...**\n    *   This starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The -Br group is *ortho, para*-directing. Subsequent substitutions would lead to 1,2- or 1,4-disubstituted products, which is not suitable for achieving the 1,3,5-pattern. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Acetophenone (Acylation).\n    *   Step ii: Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (Bromination, correct *meta*-direction).\n    *   Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Nitration, correct regiochemistry as explained in Strategy 2).\n    *   The first three steps constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are nonsensical as they would modify the product and eventually lead back to a precursor. However, among the choices, this is the only option that contains a correct synthetic core. It is common in such questions that the correct option contains the right path, even with extraneous steps added.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts by forming aniline (Nitrobenzene → Aniline). Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on aniline is problematic; the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and directing *meta*. Even if 3-aminoacetophenone were formed, subsequent bromination (step iv) would be directed by the powerful *ortho, para*-directing amino group, not leading to the desired product. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    *   This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally back to benzene (iv, deamination). These first four steps are futile. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence described in the first three steps of option B (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is a chemically sound and high-yield method to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options contain fundamental flaws in their synthetic design. Despite the superfluous latter steps, option B is the only one that presents a viable pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem asks for the best sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. To solve this, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents and plan the order of their introduction onto the benzene ring.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   It has an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n*   It has a **bromo group** (-Br).\n*   It has a **nitro group** (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Routes (The Options)**\n\nWe need to find a sequence where the directing effects of the groups already on the ring lead to the desired product at each step.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Bromination of bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. Nitration would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This does not lead to the required 1,3,5-substitution pattern. This route is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and AlCl3 to form acetophenone. This is a standard and effective first step.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** Acetophenone is brominated. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. Therefore, bromination will occur at the meta position to yield 3-bromoacetophenone. This is the correct regiochemistry.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. We now have two groups on the ring: an acetyl group at position 1 (*meta*-director) and a bromo group at position 3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n        *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   The directing effects are conflicting. However, the position that is *meta* to both deactivating groups (position 5) is strongly favored. Nitration at the positions directed by the bromo group (2, 4, 6) would create a highly unstable intermediate (a resonance structure with a positive charge adjacent to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group). Thus, nitration occurs almost exclusively at position 5, yielding the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   This sequence of three steps is a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction).\n    *   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and making the reaction fail or give poor yields. This route is not efficient.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    *   Steps i-iv convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene via deamination with H3PO2. These first four steps are a futile cycle that results in no net change. This route is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sequence in option B provides a logical and high-yield pathway to the desired product. The first step introduces a *meta*-director (acetyl group), which then correctly directs the subsequent bromination and nitration to achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Therefore, nitration occurs predominantly at position 5, yielding the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   This sequence of three steps is a chemically sound and high-yield route to the desired product.
