    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic form of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8%, and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and its position is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H').\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The presence of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This pattern arises from the symmetry of the molecule, where the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would not produce the simple two-doublet pattern seen in the ¹H NMR. The four aromatic protons would be unique, leading to a more complex spectrum.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the MS data.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR data perfectly.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. This structure would produce a signal for the carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for the four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match for all the spectral data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a proton signal at 11.0 ppm. The aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm. The aromatic region would show three signals for the three protons, not two signals for four protons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of evidence point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>",
