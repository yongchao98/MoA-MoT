    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two or more chemically equivalent protons in the vinylic region (characteristic of double bonds). The singlet nature implies they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, or that they are coupled to each other but are chemically identical (an A₂ system).\n    *   The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks: 165 ppm (typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride) and 137 ppm (typical for a vinylic carbon).\n    *   The simplest molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has C₂ᵥ symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H singlet) and the two carbonyl carbons and two vinylic carbons equivalent in pairs (giving two ¹³C signals).\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a substituted cyclopentadiene with methyl groups at all four positions of the diene system. The fifth carbon of the ring is a CH₂ group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n*   The product is a bicyclic compound. Specifically, it will have a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** core structure.\n*   Let's verify the molecular formula of the product:\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄): C₅H₂(CH₃)₄\n    *   Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃): Maleic anhydride\n    *   Product: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the kinetic product (the one formed faster, and thus usually the major product) is the *endo* adduct. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* adduct is typically the more thermodynamically stable product but forms more slowly, making it the minor product under kinetic control.\n*   Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Exo* adduct**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are spatially proximate.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Geometry of the Adducts:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton. It has a one-carbon bridge (C7, from the CH₂ of the diene) and a two-carbon bridge containing a double bond (C5-C6, from C2-C3 of the diene). The anhydride is fused at C2-C3.\n    *   **Major (*Endo*) Adduct:** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the C5-C6 double bond and *anti* to the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the two protons on the anhydride portion of the backbone (let's call them H_anhydride) into an ***exo*** **position** relative to the bicyclic system. This means they point \"up,\" towards the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Minor (*Exo*) Adduct:** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side of the C5-C6 double bond and *syn* to the C7 bridge. This forces the H_anhydride protons into an ***endo*** **position**, pointing \"down,\" towards the C5-C6 double bond.\n\n*   **Identifying the Key NOE Interaction:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the *exo*-oriented H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the protons on the C7 bridge, specifically the one that is also on the same side (*syn* to the double bond, H_syn). They are far from the methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinylic).\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the *endo*-oriented H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinylic). They are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   The cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product** must be the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **H_syn** proton on the C7 bridge.\n\n**Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n\n*   We need to assign the proton signals described in the options to the different types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They will be significantly deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. Due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **C7 Bridge Protons:** The C7 bridge has two diastereotopic protons (H_syn and H_anti). They will appear as two distinct signals, each integrating to 1H. They will be coupled to each other, appearing as doublets. Their chemical shift is in the aliphatic region, but on a strained ring; **~1.5 ppm** is a reasonable estimate for one of them (H_syn). So, we are looking for a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (Me_vinylic):** These are two methyl groups attached to the double bond. They are equivalent by symmetry. Their shift will be around **~1.7 ppm** (a **6H singlet**).\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Me_bridgehead):** These are two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry and are more shielded. Their shift will be around **~1 ppm** (a **6H singlet**).\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product connects H_anhydride and H_syn. Based on our assignments, this is the interaction between:\n    *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\n*   This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, Me_bridgehead) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, Me_vinylic): These are not uniquely close in the major product.\n*   B) 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, Me_vinylic) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, H_anhydride): This interaction is strong in the *minor* (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n*   D) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, Me_bridgehead) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, H_bridge): This would be an interaction between a bridgehead methyl and a bridge proton. The H_anti proton is close to the bridgehead carbons, so this interaction would likely be present in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and the interpretation of NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile (Anhydride):** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). A single peak implies that all vinylic protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks: one at 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O) and one at 137 ppm (characteristic of a vinylic carbon, C=C). The presence of only two signals indicates a high degree of symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   The simplest structure that fits all these criteria is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two vinylic carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals).\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring fused to the existing five-membered ring, creating a bicyclic system.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** **adduct** and the ***exo*** **adduct**.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is a 2D NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å apart), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Visualizing the Adducts:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C=C double bond. This places the two protons on the anhydride portion of the backbone (let's call them **H_anhydride**) in a position where they point towards the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"away\" from the C=C double bond. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in a position where they point towards the vinylic methyl groups on the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Identifying the Key NOE Interaction:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is unique to the major product is the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the protons on the **C7 bridge**.\n\n**Step 4: Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n\nNow we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in our structure.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They will be significantly deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is appropriate. Due to a plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** The C7 bridge has two protons that are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled to each other, so they will appear as doublets. Being aliphatic protons in a strained ring, a chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is reasonable for one of them. This corresponds to a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the double bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are equivalent. They are more shielded and will appear as a **6H singlet** at **~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are not uniquely close in the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). This interaction is possible but is not the key differentiating feature between the *endo* and *exo* isomers. The interaction described in C is the most distinct difference.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride (Dienophile):** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). A single peak indicates that the vinylic protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks: 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O) and 137 ppm (characteristic of a vinylic carbon, C=C). The presence of only two signals for what must be at least a 4-carbon skeleton confirms a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The only common molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride possesses a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, which aligns perfectly with the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly identifies the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. In this case, it will form a bicyclic adduct with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core.\n*   The reaction yields a major and a minor product. In a Diels-Alder reaction, these correspond to the ***endo*** and ***exo*** stereoisomers.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product (it forms faster) and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) is confirmed by adding the formulas of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n\n**3. Interpret the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is a 2D NMR technique that reveals which protons are close to each other in 3D space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n*   The problem states there is a cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Visualizing the Structures:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring. This geometry brings the two protons on the anhydride portion of the backbone (**H_anhydride**) close to the protons on the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclic system. Specifically, they are close to the *syn* proton on that bridge (the one on the same side as the double bond).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring points away from the cyclohexene ring. This geometry moves the **H_anhydride** protons far away from the C7 bridge protons. Instead, they are brought closer to the vinylic methyl groups on the double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be the one showing the interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **C7 bridge proton(s)**.\n\n**4. Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n\nWe need to assign the proton signals described in the options to the specific protons in the product molecule.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two equivalent protons are on carbons flanked by carbonyl groups, making them highly deshielded. They are adjacent to bridgehead carbons with no protons, so they appear as a singlet. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is a very reasonable assignment for this **2H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** The C7 bridge has two diastereotopic protons (*syn* and *anti*). They are coupled to each other and will appear as two separate 1H doublets. Being aliphatic protons in a strained ring, a chemical shift in the range of 1-2 ppm is expected. A value of **~1.5 ppm** for one of these is a reasonable assignment for a **1H doublet**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyls:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond will appear as a **6H singlet** at around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are more shielded and will appear as a **6H singlet** at around **~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe key NOESY interaction in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons.

Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is a 2D NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å apart), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Visualizing the Adducts:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C=C double bond. This places the two protons on the anhydride portion of the backbone (let's call them **H_anhydride**) in a position where they point towards the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"away\" from the C=C double bond. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in a position where they point towards the vinylic methyl groups on the C=C double bond and are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   **Identifying the Key NOE Interaction:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is unique to the major product is the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the protons on the **C7 bridge**.\n\n**4. Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n\nNow we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in our structure.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They will be significantly deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is appropriate. Due to a plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** The C7 bridge has two protons that are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled to each other, so they will appear as doublets. Being aliphatic protons in a strained ring, a chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is reasonable for one of them. This corresponds to a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the double bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are equivalent. They are more shielded and will appear as a **6H singlet** at **~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are not uniquely close in the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). This is not the key differentiating feature between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
