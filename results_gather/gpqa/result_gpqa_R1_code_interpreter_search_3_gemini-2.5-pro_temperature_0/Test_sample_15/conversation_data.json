    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound that rotates the plane of polarized light. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers) and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is built around a C=C double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity gives the molecule a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The important part of the name for determining optical activity is the stereochemical descriptor `(3aR,7aS)`.\n    *   These descriptors specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (C-3a and C-7a).\n    *   When a name specifies a single, specific stereoisomer with R/S designations that don't cancel each other out (as in a meso compound), it refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical, with identical groups (`-CH(CH3)COOH`) on either side of the central C2-C3 bond.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the `(2R,3S)` configuration has a center of inversion and can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   As `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is a single enantiomer, it is chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, which is bonded to the -OH group, is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring going the other way. The paths around the ring are different, making the groups different.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation typically refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all pointing \"up\").\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group. For example, the plane containing C1 and C4 bisects the molecule, reflecting C2 onto C6 and C3 onto C5.\n    *   Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. A stereocenter is a carbon with four different substituents.\n    *   C3 is bonded to an H, two identical methyl groups (`-CH3`), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   There are no other stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   Although some conformations of this molecule might be chiral, the molecule has free rotation around its single bonds. It can easily access an achiral conformation that has a plane of symmetry. A molecule that can adopt an achiral conformation is considered achiral overall.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>",

The atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, and the first C of the ethyl group) all lie in the same plane.

The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters.\n    *   When a chemical name designates a specific stereoisomer with R/S configurations (and it's not a meso compound), it refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) and is symmetrical in its constitution.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). This specific stereoisomer is a **meso compound**.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral, despite having stereocenters, because they are superimposable on their mirror images.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal symmetry elements.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. They form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The name `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring containing a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring.

It possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring.\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a stereocenter. Let's check for any carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the `–CH2–C(=O)–cyclopentyl` group.
